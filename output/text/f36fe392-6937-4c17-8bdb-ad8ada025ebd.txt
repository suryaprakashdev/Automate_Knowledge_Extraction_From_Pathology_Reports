FINAL DIAGNOSIS: PARt 1: SEntINel Lymph nODe #1, RighT AXILLA, BIOpSy - A.  ONE OUT OF ONE LyMPH NODE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (1/1).  THE METASTATIC FOCUS MEASURES 3.5 CM AND EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED. Part 2: breast. Right, modified, Radical mastectomy -- A.  iNFILTRATiNG LQBULAR,CARCINOMA, PLEOmORPHIC AND CLASSICAL SUBTYPES, NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (see comment). B. THE TUMOR MEASURES 7.0 CM (gross measurement) WITH NOTTINGHAM SCORE 8/9 (TUBULES 3, NUCLEAR GRADE 3, MITOSES 2). C. THE TUMOR IS MULTIFOCAL AND MULTICENTRIC, PRESENT IN LOWER OUTER QUADRANT (LOQ), UPPER OUTER QUADRANT (UOQ), UPPER INNER QUADRANT (UIQ). D. LOBULAR CARCInOMA iN SITU, PLeOmORPHiC TYPE, COMPRISING LESS THAN 5% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME AND PRESENT IN ASSOCIATED WITH iNVASIVE CARCINOMA. E.  NO DEFINITIVE LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. F.  MARGINS: ALL DEEP MARGINS AND ANTERIOR MARGIN ARE FREE OF INVASIVE CARCINOMA. G. SKIN AND NIPPLE: THE TUMOR EXTENDS THROUGH THE NIPPLE INTO THE UPPER PAPILLAR DERMIS OF THE SKIN; HOWEVER, NO ULCERATION OR PAGETOID EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED (see Comment-1). H. PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES AND ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASiA. 1. LOWER INnER QUADRANT: BENIGN BREAST tISSUE, nO TUmOR SEeN. j. ER-POSITIVE, PR-POSITIVE, HER-2/NEU - NEGATIVE (IHC SCORE 0). K. AXILLARY LYMPH NODE DISSECTION. a. EIGHT OUT OF TEN LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (8/10) (See COmment- 2). b. THE GREATEST DIMENSION OF THE METASTATIC FOCUS IS 2.0 CM AND EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED.
