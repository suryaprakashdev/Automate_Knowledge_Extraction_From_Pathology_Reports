A touch preparation is made on each node. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows: A1- iymph node #1 A2-lymph node #2 B. RIGHT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated *right breast" is an oriented (suture in axilla), 358 g, 21 x 17 x 5 cm mastectomy specimen with 7.5 x 5.4 cm beige skin ellipse showing a 1 cm diameter retracted nipple. Ink code: Posterior-deep, anterior/superior-blue, anterior/inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 13 slices revealing two possible lesions. Mass #1, in the upper inner quadrant (two o'clock, slices 9-10), 2 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm, is located 2.2-cm from the deep margin and 1.4-cm from anterior. Approximately 4.5-cm from. mass #1, a second mass is demonstrated in the upper outer quadrant (slice 8), 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm, located 2.5-cm from the deep margin and 1 cm from anterior. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue. procurement (mass #1).

RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and " axillary contents" is a 10.5 x 10.0 x 2.5 cm. portion of adipose tissue, within which, 34 possible lymph nodes are identified, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 cm. The cut surfaces of the larger nodes are fatty to soft tan-pink. No evidence of tumor is grossly noted. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows: C1-six lymph nodes C2-six lymph nodes C3-six lymph nodes C4-six lymph nodes C5-seven lymph nodes C6- one lymph node bisected C7-one lymph node bisected C8-C9-one lymph node C10-C14-remaining soft tissue DIAGNOSIS: A.

TSS  None given INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION TPA: Positive for carcinoma. Called by Dr. to Dr at. Right breast, gross examination: Two possible lesions, mass number one, 1.5-cm located 3.2-cm from deep margin and 1.4-cm from anterior, mass number two, 2-cm in size located 2.5-cm from deep and 1cm from anterior Diagnosis called at . by Dr. ADDENDUM: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case NoAnalytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ  hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome 17 rentromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the.  by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used B7 Source of case:Tissue fixation  formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No:NA Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.15 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free and overall survival in stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No treatment decision for stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER- 2/neu gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test FDA APPROVED REAGENT  PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of natients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the , under the direction. of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
