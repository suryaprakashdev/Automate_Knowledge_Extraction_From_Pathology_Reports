C77,O 9-201z Rd Flow Cytometry Date Ordered: Status: Date Reported Interpretation Lymph Node Left Neck: A population of mature B-cells with increased forward and side light soatter expressing CD19, CD20, partial CD25, high-density CD38 and monotypic, intermediate density lambda Jight chains is present at 43% of lymphocytes (25% of isolated cells). This phenotype is consistent with a. B-cell lynphoproliferative disorder and suggests an intermodiate to high-grade process. Correlation with morphologic studies is required for definitive classification. ** Note: For additional testing detalls see Flow Cytometry Report. Thase materials wery Dlo staffpathologist 1 of3
