Page 2 of 3 1). The specimen is received Eresh, labeled "right colectomy" and consists. of a segment of terminal ileum (10 cm long x 4 cm diameter), cecum and ascending colon (23 cm long x 5 to 9 cm diameter), appendix (4.5 cm long x) 0.4 to 2 cm diameter) and attached adipose tissue / omentum (23 x 23 x 1.5 cm). The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. The appendix contains a 2 cm fecalith and shows a normal mucosal surface. The The specimen is opened to reveal a and located 12 cm and 16 cm from the distal and proximal resection margins, respectively. The lesion is centrally necrotic with a heaped-up border, is firm and tan-yellow. It spares the ileocecal valve and appendiceal orifice. by 4.5 and 5.2 cm, respectively. Sectioning shows the tumor to extend into the muscularis propria and possibly beyond it, into the pericolonic adipose tissue. In this area, the serosa is puckered (inked black).. The depth of invasion is approximately 0.5 cm in the ulcerated center. The remaining mucosa is normal.  The specimen is submitted for lymph node disseotion and all identified lymph nodes in the attached adipose tissue are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections. and for Summary of sections: p-- proximal margin shave D -- distal margin shave M-- mass, representative Ms .- mass to puckered serosal surtace, representative.
