MEDICAL RECORD Surgical Pathology Report Name: Accession No.: MRN: Date of Report: Findings: right renal mass SPECIMENS SUBMITTED: KIDNEY, RIGHT, And Gerota's fascia GROss DEscRIPriON: The specimen is received is a single container labeled with.the patient's name,. medical record number, and "right kidney and Gerota's fascia". The specimen consists of a nephrectomy weighing 215.1 grams and measuring 12 x 10 x 4 cm in dimension. No palpable mass is present. The surgica margin is inked in black and bivalved via the antehilar surface to reveal a kidney-colored nodule measuring 2.1 x 1.5 cm at the corticomedullary junction. The tumor is greater than 2 cm from the closest surgical margin and is well circumscribed. A 1 x 1 cm piece of nodule and a 1 x 1 cm piece of normal-appearing parenchyma is procured for UOB. Photographs have been taken of the case. The procurement was performed by  In Surgical Pathology, the specimen is received in a formalin-filled container. The. specimen has been previously bivalved and half of the tumor has been shelled out. The remainder of the tumor is located at the corticomedullary junction. Cut sectioning of the tumor demonstrates a brownish, normal- appearing kidney parenchyma surrounding the nodular tan-brown tumor mass. Deep to the tumor within the cortex is a clear fluid-filled cortical cyst. On half of the kidney which was previously procured, the tumor appears to infiltrate into the normal-appearing kidney parenchyma with pushing borders in a very thin white capsule surrounding the tumor from the normal kidney. The tumor does not appear to involve the hilum and is 0.3 cm from the hilar edge of the kidney, and 0.4 cm from the perinephric fat. The vascular and ureteral margins are grossly free of tumor. Sectioning through the remainder of the kidney demonstrates brown-tan, unremarkable kidney parenchyma with no additional nodules are mass is seen. There is no perinephric fat surrounding the capsule of the kidney deep to the tumor nodule. Sectioning through the hilar fat demonstrates no lymph node candidates. Analysis of the renal artery demonstrates an area of atherosclerosis which is approximately 60% occluded. There are no additional nodules or masses seen in the perinephric fat.. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. I A-C - tumor at closest surgical margin and hilum. 1 D - vascular and ureteral margin E - normal kidney parenchyma :  F - atherosclerotic blood vessel cross-section Gross dictated by Patient Identification Surgical Pathology Report File in Section 3: Tissue Examination Page 2
