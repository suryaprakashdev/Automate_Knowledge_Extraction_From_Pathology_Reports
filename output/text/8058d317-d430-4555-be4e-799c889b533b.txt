Diagnosis called to Dr. at .. by Dr. ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen:  Surgical Excision Block Number: A9 Interpretation: EQUIvOCAL Intensity: 2+ % Tumor Staining: 20% Fish Ordered: Yes , on Date.  METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit ) using rabbit anti- human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manutacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along

with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaiuation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP  and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility. for this test's performance.. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Resuits: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology Core Facility by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17 signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene.. Block used  A9 Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.02 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSi HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Ceils with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is  intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free  and overall survival in stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of invoived lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test FDA APPROVED REAGENT  PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceotin theranv is heina considered. These tests were performed in the under the direction ot Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
