TCGA-AL-3471 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Clinical History/Diagnosis: Right Kidney Mass. Source of Specimen(s): right Kidney resection with Adrenal gland Gross Description: Received in one part. Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "right kidney'. Frozen Section Diagnosis: 1FS- PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA PER Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ",. right kidney". It consists of a 460 gram right nephrectomy consisting of a kidney measuring 10.5 x 6 x 6 cm and perinephric fat measuring from 1 up. to 5 cm from point of attachment. Dissection through the fat discloses no lesions, masses or nodal tissue. There is an area of fullness in the lower pole of the nephrectomy. At the hilum there is a 0.5 cm of ureter.. The right ureter is opened and has a pin point lumen. The vascular margin. is also unremarkable. The kidney is bivalved disclosing a soft. predominantly necrotic mass in the lower pole that measures 4.4 x 3.5 x. 3.5 cm. The lesion compresses the inferior calcyx. The tumor is soft, necrotic, brownish-orange in color and towards the periphery there is some. more solid possible viable Iesion. Representative sections from areas to include possible lesion is submitted for frozen section in 1FS. The capsule and fat overlying the tumor are intact with no areas suspicious for invasion. Elsewhere the parenchyma is normal with the usual cortico-medulary junction present. Gross Photographs are Taken.. Designation of Sections: 1A- vascular and ureter margin, 1B- tumor in relationship to calyceal system, 1C-1E- tumor, 1F-1G- tumor with overlying. fascia and capsule, 1H- uninvolved right kidney, 1I- perinephric fat Note: Tissue is procured and sent for Cytogenetic Studies.. ************************ Final Diagnosis: 1. Right kidney: -Low gradd papillary renal cell carcinoma (type 1) - 4.4 cm tumor is limited to kidney.. --No lymphovascular invasion is identified. - Margins are negative for tumor..

 No lymph nodes are identified - Uninvolved kidney shows scattered globally sclerotic glomeruli.. - pT1bNxMx Procedures/Addenda FC Cytogenetics Solid Tumor Results-Comments CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS DIAGNOSIS: Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma KARYOTYPE: Abnormal karyotype: 42 46,X,-Y,+2,+3,-4,+8,+16,+17,+20[cp9] One cell also contained an extra copy of chromosome 7 among other numerical changes. RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after seven and nine days in. culture. Only nine metaphases could be found in a scan of ten slides.. The chromosomes from these metaphases were counted and analyzed, and four of the metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. All the cells contained numerical chromosome abnormalities that are listed in the karyotypic. description above. The extra copies of chromosomes 16, 17, and 20 and the. missingchromosome have all been reported in papillary renal cell. carcinoma (PRCC). Although only one cell contained an extra copy of. chromosome 7, this is a significant finding in PRCC.
