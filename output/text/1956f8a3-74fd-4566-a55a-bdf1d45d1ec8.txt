At the section, a pigmented tumor nodule is observed. Tissue specimens are taken for genetic studies and cryopreservation prior fixation. Microscopy The tumor nodule observed macrocopically presents the morphology of an uveal melanoma. This tumor is composed mainly of epithelioid cells, more rarely fusiform.. The cell atypias are severe. The pigmented load is mild. The mitotic activity is moderate. The tumor is at distance from the optic nerve which is free on its entire course. The ciliary body is also free. There is a focal tumor extension on the inner. third of the sclera, without extra-scleral exteriorisation. The cut end of the optic nerve is free. Conclusion Uveal melanoma, mainly composed of epithelioid cells. Tumor size: 15X15 mm main lines. Mitotic activity: moderate. Focal tumor infiltration of the 1/3 inner part of the sclera, without extra-scleral extension. Ciliary body, optic nerve on its entire course and optic nerve cut end free of tumor.
