Patient ID: Surgical Date: Gross Description: A. "Fat over mass." A 6.5 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate of unremarkable fatty fragments. B. "Left kidney ." A 186 gram, 13.5 x 7.5 x 3.1 cm kidney with previously stripped perinephric fat and capsule. The renal artery, vein and ureter at the margin are unremarkable. A well circumscribed slightly necrotic 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm mass in the lower pole is grossly confined within the kidney. No extension into the small amount of perinephric fat is identified. The remainder of the kidney to include the renal pelvis is grossly unremarkable. A separate 6.5 x 4.5 cm aggregate of perinephric fat is received and is unremarkable. Microscopic Description: Procedure type: Radical nephrectomy Histologic grade (Fuhrman): Mostly grade 2, focally (10-20%) grade 3. Sarcomatoid features: Absent. IcD-o-3 Tumor size: 3.5 cm Carcentine,papllsry renaQ eeQl 8Qed|3 Extent: Limited to kidney. Site Budneey NOS Adrenal Gland:  Not present in specimen. C64.4 Angiolymphatic invasion: Absent. AS/d5/13 Margins: All margins free of tumor Fat over mass (A): Benign adipose tissue. UUID:F8C9C91D-6AED-43EF-BC8F-0481A311706B TCGA-F9-A7VF-01A-PR Redacted Lymph nodes: None present Pathologic stage: pT1a Nx Mx Non-neoplastic kidney: Atherosclerosis, mild glomerulosclerosis and scarring Focal papillary adenoma (1 mm) away from tumor mass, Immunostains were previously performed on the biopsy and consistent with a papillary RCc. Neoplasm has relatively higher Fuhrman nuclear grade. than typical papillary renal cell carcinoma (probably grade 3), however morphology is compatible..  Immunostains for cytokeratin 7, pancytokeratin, p504S and PAx-8 were performed and all four stainse are positive. This is consistent with a papillary-type renal cell carcinoma. Diagnosis Details: KIDNEY (LEFT, B): RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, PAPILLARY TYPE (TYPE I) Comments: Formatted Path Reports: KIDNEY TISSUE CHECKLIST Specimen type: Nephrectomy
