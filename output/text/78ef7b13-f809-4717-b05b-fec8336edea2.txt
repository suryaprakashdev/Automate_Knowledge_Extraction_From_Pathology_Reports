UUID:15FE46F1-194A-4799-8C77-A3FA23CC5096 Redacted TSS Patient ID: Surgical Date: Gross Description: Received is 1 specimen with pancreatic and duodenal tissue. with severa! sutures present. The duodenum measures 19 cm in length x 3.2. cm in diameter. The serosal surface is smooth, glistening, tan-pink with cautery artifact. The duodenum is opened longitudinally to reveal tan-brown mucosa with an ampulla that is 5 cm from the proximal margin, and. is surrounded by a 1.7 x 1 cm red-tan ulcerative lesion.. The pancreas measures 7.5 x 6 x 4.5 cm, and the neck margin is removed en. face and submitted for frozen section diagnosis. The pancreas is sectioned to reveal that the major pancreatic duct is obstructed approximately 1.5 cm from the neck margin. There is an ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow lesion that is 2 x 2.5 x 2.3 cm. The mass possibly invades the common bile duct, which is friable and hemorrhagic, and dilated to 1.2 cm in diameter. The common bile duct is patent through the ampulla. The mass is 1 cm to the neck margin, 0.8 cm to ED-o-3 HS 5/1c/14 the long blue (portal vein), 2.8 cm to the long black (SMA), 0.6 to looped black (deep radial), 0.1 cm to nearest radial margin, and 6 cm to the proximal duodenal margin. ** Microscopic Description: FNos Diagnosis Details: - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated 4.25.0 - AJCC pathologic stage (7th edition): pT3 pN1, stage IIB Pancreas (Exocrine) Cancer Synopsis Specimens Involved Specimens:.
