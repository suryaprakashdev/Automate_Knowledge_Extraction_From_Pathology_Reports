SP: Soft tissue, perinephric; excisior Fibroadipose tissue with fibrosis, fat nec I camicalion; no tumor seen. SP: Lymph nodes #2, paracaval; excision Lymph Nodes: Not invoived Number of nodes examined:7 Benign sogment of ureter.. TATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (ANDIOR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT IHAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT Gross Description: 1)The specimen is received fresh, labeled "paracaval lymph node" and consists of a 2.4 X 1.8x 0.4 cm fragment of tan red lissue. No definite lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted. Summary of seclions:. U -- undesignated perinephric fal weighing 281.5 g in total. The kidney measures 7.9 x 5.2 x 5.0 cm. The atlached ureter measures 2.4 cm in length and O.4 cm in diameter. The allached renal vein measures 1.9 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identified. There is a 2.9 x 2.3 cm previous excision site al a. kidney pole. The excision site is inked blue while the remainder of the kidney is inked black. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a. 3.8 x 3.7 x 3. I cm largely hemorrhagic and partially gold - lan tumor that is located in the hilar fat. Seclions through the remainder. of the kidney reveal pink- brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.6. d the calyces appear normal. No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric fat. Representative sections are submitted fo!. and for permanent sections. Photographs are taken. Summary of seclions:. UVM -- ureteral and vessel margins T.fumor THF-- tumor with hilar fal. TSF -- tumor wilh sinus fat TK -- tumor with adjacent kidney TC -- lumor to capsule K -- represenlative sections kidney  BX -- previous excision site 3) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consullation, labeled "perinephric soft tissue stitch marks area of interest' and consists of a iragment of fibroadipose measuring 5.0 x 3.7 x 2.4 cin. The specimen is focally suraced by a 3.5 x 1.0 cm fragmen! of fibromembranous tissue. The area around the stitch is inked black. Tho remainder of the specimen is inked blue. Cut surfaces show a 2.9 x 2.3 x 1.5 cm area of fat necrosis with a capsule. There are multiple surgical staptes within the. specimen. Representatively submilted for frozon section. Page 2 of 3
