The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette. I: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right cloquet lymph node." It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan, soft tissue measuring 3 x 2 x i cm. possible lymph nodes are identified with the largest one measuring 1.8 cm in greatest dimension..  The lymph nodes are bisected and the specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.. J:  The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right obturator lymph nodes." It consists of multiple fragments of yellow-tan soft tissue measuring 7 x 5 x 1 cm dimension.  The specimen is entirely submitted in three cassettes. K:  The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right external iliac lymph node." It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan soft tissue meaauring 3 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm.  One lymph node is identified measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The. lymph node is bisected and the specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette. L  The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right hypogastric lymph node." It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan soft tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.  The specimen is received in formalin and labeled Right common iliac lymph M node." It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan soft tissue meausring 2 x i x 1 cm.  One lymph node is identified which measures 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node is bisected and the specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette. N: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left proximal ureter."

C: Sections of the fungating seen grossly on the left posterior trigone region of bladder corresponding histologically to a poorly differentiated invasive transitional cell carcinoma, grade 4/4 (cs-10). The neoplastic cells have high N/C ratios with large pleomorphic nuclei and are arranged in solid sheets. The cytoplasm shows clear cell change. There is focal squamous metaplasia present as well as frequent mitosis. A moderate inflammatory response to the tumor is noted. The tumor extends through the muscularis propria. The radial inked resection margins are free of tumor.  No associated transitional cell carcinoma in situ identified. No definitive lymphovascular space invasion is seen. Sections of the prostate show extensive neoplastic process involving the right and left lobes from distal to proximal (c17-20,24). The tumor is characterized predominantly by irregularly shaped and variably sized malignant glands that randomly infiltrate the stroma. A small component of the tumor show malignant gland fusion. The neoplastic cells are medium to large with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The prostatic

Bilateral seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia are free of tumor.  Apical margin is free of tumor. In addition to invasive carcinoma, the prostatic parenchyma shows high grade prostatic stratified layers of enlarged cells with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli.
