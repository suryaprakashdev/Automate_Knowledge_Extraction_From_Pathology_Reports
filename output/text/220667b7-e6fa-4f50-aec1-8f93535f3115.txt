Lymph node, right axilla sentinel node, biopsy: euadrost - Carcinoma in 1 sentinel node following carcinoma of right breast. As Os/i1/14 B. Breast, right, Iumpectomy:. - Carcinoma, invasive ductal type, moderately-differentiated, with focal mlcropapillary features, Nottingham's score 5 (2+2+1).. - Carcinoma, intraductal, comedo type with microcaicifications. - Lobular neoplasla, focal, classical type.. - Fibrocystic disease, proliferative, with apocrine metaplasia, sclerosing adenosis and microcalcifications. - Cicatricial fibrosis and organizing granulation tissue with fat necrosis, consistent with previous biopsy site. - Fibroadenoma, microscopic.. C. Lymph nodes, right axilla, dissection:. - No evidence of carcinoma in 14 lymph nodes. Date Dictated: CLinICAL INFORmATION: Breast cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in three parts.. Part A is received fresh from the operating room for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled with the patient's name and "R sentinel lymph node". It consists of one firm tan to red lymph node measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned. Submitted in toto in three cassettes labeled AFS, A1 and A2. AFS = frozen section, A1 - A2 = remaining tissue. Part B is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name and "R breast lumpectomy". It consists of a piece of yellow-white fibrofatty tissue measuring 10.5 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm. An ellipse of skin is not present. An X-ray is received. A localization needle is not noted. A short suture is noted indicating the superior margin and a row of long sutures are noted indicating the lateral margin. A mass is palpated in the center. The superficial surface is inked yellow Page i of 3

and the deep surface is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned. On cut section, the mass is tan, firm, poorly. .circumscribed and measures 3.2 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm. The mass comes to 0.3 cm of the superficial, 0.5 cm of the deep and 2.5 cm of the lateral margins. The tissue is composed of 60% fat and 40% intermixed firm tan-white parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted in 29 cassettes labeled B1 - B29. Legend: B1 = mass and closest deep surface, B2 = mass and closest superficial surface(B1 and B2 = full thickness of mass),. B3 - 88 = mass with adjacent deep margin B9 - B17 - superficial margin over mass. 818 - B19 = mass B20 - B21 = superior B22 - B23 = deep margin in lateral part(ciosest to mass) B24 - B25 = lateral B26 - B27 = inferior B28 - B29 = rnedial. Part C is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name and "R axillary lymph node dissection". It consists of two pieces of yellow-red fatty tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm and 10.0 x 7.0 x 1.0 cm. A suture is noted attached to one end of the larger piece of fatty tissue. Fourteen lymph moves measuring from 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 crn to 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm are identified. The lymph nodes are submitted in toto 10 cassettes labeled C1 - C10.. Legend: C1 = five intact nodes, C2 - C5 = one bisected node in each cassettes, C6 = one intact node, C7 - C8 = one large quadrisected node, C9 - C10 = nodes closest to suture(larger node is bisected)..
