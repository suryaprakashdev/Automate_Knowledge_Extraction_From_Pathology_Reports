SURGICAL PATHOL Report 17 x 9 cm. The nipple-areolar compiex measures 5.5 cm and it appears unremarkable. The specimen is oriqnted with one. stitch-superior, two stitches-mediai. Resection margins are inked black. On serial section, there is a tan-white indurated ill- defined lesion with infiltrative borders present at the lower outer quadrant, at approximately 5 o'clock positiqn. This lesion measures 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm. It is located 0.2 cm from the medial margin (ciosest), 2.5 cm deep margin, 3 cm from inferior margin, 8 cm from superior margin, 15 cm from lateral margin and 6 cm from nipple. A metal clip is identifieq within the lesion. No other leslons are grossly identified. No lymph nodes are present within the main specimen. Cassettes are. submitted as follows:  Mass in relation to medial margin. 2 Deep margin 3 Superior margin 4 Inferior margin 5 Lateral margin 6 Nipple 7 Skin closest to lesion 8-10 Remainder of the lesion, submitted in toto F. Received in formalin is an 897-gm left mastectomy specimen measuring 18 x 16 x 4 cm. An attached ellipst of skin is. present. The nipple areolar complex is unremarkable. On serial sections, no lesions or suspicious areas are grossly. identified. The breast parenchyma has a fat to stroma ratio of 70:30. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1&2 Upper outer quadrant 3&4 Upper lower quadrant. 5&6 Upper inner quadrant 7&8 Lower inner quadrant 9  Nipple G.  Received in formalin is a segment of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 8 x 4 x 4 cm. Examination of the specimen reveals multiple possible lymph nodes. Cassettes are submitted as follows: 1-6 One lymph node bisected per cassette 7 Two lymph nodes in toto. 8-10 Three lymph nodes in toto per cassette. H.  Received in formalin are three fragments of tan yellow to gray fibroadlpose tissue measuring in aggregate. 2|5 x 1 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette. Page 4 of 4
