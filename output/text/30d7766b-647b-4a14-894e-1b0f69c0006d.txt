Lobular carcinoma in situ (less than 5% of tumor volume) is present. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows nonproliferative fibrocystic changes with duct ectasia. Calcifications are present in benign ducts and acini. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All surgical margins, including the deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.8 cm, deep margin). A single (of 6) lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1]. Lymph node, left axillary, sentinel No. 1, excision: A single left axillary sentinel lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression. Blue dye is not identified. Lymph node, left axillary sentinel No. 2, excision: A single left axillary sentinel lymph node is negative for metastatic carcinoma. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression. Blue dye is identified. Lymph node, left axillary, sentinel No. 3, excision: A single left axillary sentinel lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma with a single focus measuring 0.9 cm in greatest dimensions. Blue dye is identified. Lymph nodes, left axillary, dissection: Multiple (6) axillary lymph nodes are negative for. metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN1]. Estrogen and progesterone receptor analysis and Her-2/NEU have been ordered on paraffin. embedded tissue. Seen in consultation with Dr..
