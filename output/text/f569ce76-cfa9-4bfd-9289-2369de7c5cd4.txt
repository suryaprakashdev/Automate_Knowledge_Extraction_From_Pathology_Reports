SURGICAL PATHOL Report Gross Description: A. Received in formalin is a 180 gram 11.5 x 7.5 x 3.5 cm left lumpectomy specimen without wire guide.The $pecimen is. oriented with one stitch superior, two stitches lateral and three stitches deep. Resection margins are inkedlas follows:. Superior blue, inferior green, medial red, lateral orange, deep black, anterior yellow. On serial section throygh the  specimen, there is a tan-white ill-defined indurated mass with infiltrating borders that measures 2.0 x 2.0 x 15 cm. This. mass is present at 0.6 cm from the anterior margin, 2.0 cm from the superior margin, 2.2 cm from the infericr margin, 2.4 cm from the deep margin, 3.8 cm from the lateral margin and 2.7 cm from the medial margin. An area of tan-white The breast fibrosis Is present adjacent to the mass. This area measures 2.8 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm. No other lesions are identified.. parenchyma has a fat to stroma ratio of 80-20. Sections submitted as follows:. Anterior margin (ciosest) 2 Inferior margin 3 Superior and deep margin. 4 Lateral and deep margins. 5-8 Lesions submitted in toto 9  Representative section of fibrotic area adjacent to lesion. B. Received in formalin is a segment of tan-yellow fibroadipose tissue, measuring 13.0 x 11.0 x 4.0 cm. Examination of the. specimen reveals multiple possible lymph nodes, measuring up to 2.4 cm.
