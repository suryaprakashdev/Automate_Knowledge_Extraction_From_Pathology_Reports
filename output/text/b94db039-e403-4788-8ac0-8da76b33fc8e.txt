Sffieer loug Bcell Lyynphorro 968d/3 Tumor ID # Date of Surgery: Sute: BramSten c717 Ot bf28/13 Microscopic Description:. Sections demonstrate sheets of poorly cohesive, large cells. These have large atypical, somewhat open nuclei, usually with multiple nucleoli. They have only a modest amount of cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic figures are seen. Individual apoptotic cells are seen without frank necrosis. The tumor has an expansive interface with the surrounding parenchyma but an angiocentric pattern is also appreciated. Areas of apparent glial and fibrous scarring are also noted. Diagnosis: Brainstem Tumor: diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma, B-cell type UUID: B40907C0-DA7B-436F-993A-53DA4C9A56A9 TCGA-RQ-A68N-01A-PR Redacted

ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY REPORT PERMANENT CHART COPY NEUROPATHOLOGY REPORT GROSS DESCRIPTION:S MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 1, 2. Sections demonstrate sheets of poorly cohesive, large cells. These have large atypical, somewhat open nuclei, usually with multiple nucleoli. They have only' a modest amount of cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic figures are seen. Individual apoptotic cells are seen without frank necrosis. The tumor has an. expansive interface with the surrounding parenchyma but an angiocentric. pattern is also appreciated. Areas of apparent glial and fibrous scarring are also noted.. The neoplastic cells are imnunoreactive for cD45 and cD20, confirming B-cell. lymphocytic origin. They are negative for Grap, S-100 and cytokeratin 8/18. The neoplastic cells demonstrate aberrant expression of the T-cell marker cD43. but are negative for cD3 and cD45 ro. They demonstrate BcL2 and BCL6 positivity but are negative for cdio. Overall, the immunophenotype is consistent with a diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma. DIAGNOSIS: (PROVISIONAL) : 1. 2.
