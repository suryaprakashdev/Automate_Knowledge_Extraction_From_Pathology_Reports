ADDENDUM DISCUSSION: The calculated MIB-1 labeling index is 12.5% ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS 1-6. TEMPORAL LOBE TUMOR, INCLUDING AMYGDALA, ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR TEMPORAL LOBE, UNCUS AND HIPPOCAMPUS: ANAPLASTIC OLIGODENDROGLIOMA (WHO GRADE III) IN PREDOMINANT BACKGROUND OF LOW GRADE (GRADE II) OLIGODENDROGLIOMA. MIB-1 LABELING INDEX = 12.5% MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 1-3, 5-6. Sections demonstrate cortical gray and white matter, including hippocampus. They demonstrate a variably cellular and infiltrating diffuse glioma that is characterized by round nuclei with perinuclear halos or a microgemistocytic phenotype. In the majority of the specimen, the. microgemistocytic phenotype predominates and in large areas is the only pattern seen. Atypia is mild to focally moderate with a few highly atypical nuclei seen. Mitoses are rare in these sections and microvascular proliferation and necrosis are not present.. 4. Sections of the tissue designated as enhancing uncus demonstrate consistent marked hypercellularity. The atypia is greater than that seen in the other regions. In contrast to the presence of only rare mitotic figures in the other regions, scattered mitoses are readily identified. Up to six are seen per 10 high power fields. Microvascular proliferation is also noted. There is no. tumor necrosis.
