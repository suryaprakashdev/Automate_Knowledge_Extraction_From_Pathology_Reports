"Left breast", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 600 gram, 30.3 x 2.4 cm axilla, two at 24 x 8 cm ellipse of skin and 1.2 cm nipple with 4 cm areola is received. The specimen is marked with blue ink and sectioned to exhibit a 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm firm white mass towards the axilla.  The tumor comes to within 1.8 cm of the superior margin, 1.6 cm of the inferior margin, 2 cm of the posterior margin and 3 cm from the skin.. Areas of hemorrhage are. present around the site of the mass, consistent with the previous biopsy..

NIPPLE: FREE OF TUMOR. SKIN: FREE OF TUMOR. MUSCLE: NOT IDENTIFIED. LYMPH NODE STATUS: - NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IS IDENTIFIED IN SEVENTEEN LYMPH NODES (0/17). ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR, CELL CYCLE, AND HER2/NEU ANALYSIS: PENDING, THE RESULTS OF WHICH WILL BE REPORTED IN AN ADDENDUM. METHODOLOGY: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, PARAFFIN BLOCK NUMBER A3. I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es). ORIGINAL VER ID CI ADDENDUM 1 ORIGINAL TEXT: NUCLEAR ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR ANALYSIS A tissue block was sent to the for assay of activity is judged to be posirivs with an estimated fmol/mg cytosolic protein value of 275.  Approximately 95% of the infiltrating carcinoma cells exhibit nuclear estrogen receptor expression. Benign ductal epithelium stains positively and serves as the internal control.  Results were obtained using a manual method with Signet antibodies and a detection kit. The PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR activity is judged to be BORDERLINE with an estimated fmol/mg cytosolic protein value of 6.  Approximately 1% of the tumor cells exhibit nuclear progesterone receptor expression.. Benign ductal epithelium stains positively and serves as the internal control. Results were obtained using a manual method with Signet antibodies and a detection kit. Please refer to for a complete report. HER2/neu IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS Immunostaining for HeR2/neu (c-erbb-2) oncoprotein is performed on recut. sections of block A3.  The tumor cells exhibit no staining of their cell membrane (score - 0). indicating that they do not overexpress HeR2/neu Oncoprotein. METHOD  The immunostaining is done using DAko rabbit anti-human c-erbb-2 oncoprotein which is an affinity-isolated antibody ( . The immunostaining is performed after antigen retrieval by heating the. unstained sections at 95 degrees centigrade for 20 minutes in 10 mM citrate staining), with an incubation for one hour at 37 degrees centigrade. The Histostain Plus kit !. is used as the detection system. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Immunopathology Laboratory. It has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. test is used for clinical purposes. This It should not be regarded as investigational or for research only.  This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIa) as qualified to
