A:Subcutaneous mass 8:Left kidney (fresh) Cllnical History The patient is an female with a ieft kidney mass which is solid and cystic in the left upper. pole. This lesion is greater than 5 cm. Additionally, there is a second lesion in the interpolar region. The patia.t also has a 2.4 cm lesion in the liver. She now undergoes a left laparoscopic nephrectomy Gross Description The specimen is received fresh in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. Part A, additionally labeled "subcutaneous mass,* consists of three fragments of white and yellow soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. These fragments are entirely submitted in cassette A1. Part B, additionally labeled "left kidney," consists of a 236 gram, 14 x 6 x 6 cm kidney with a small. amount of perinephric fat. The superior pole has a 4.6 cm, red to yellow soft mass with solid and liquefied areas within 0.3 cm of the pelvis and abutting the renal capsule over much of the tumor. The tumor is suspicious for invasion into the renal capsule grossly. Additionally a second lesion is identified in the interpolar region of the kidney, which is entirely contained in the cortex and does not appear to invade. This lesion is composed of a cyst-like space measuring 2.4 cm. Cassettes are submitted as follows: Cassette B1: Pelvic margin vessels and ureter. Cassette 82: Pelvis with red to yellow mass. Cassette 83: Cystic lesion to pelvis.. Cassette B4: Normal pelvis. Cassette B5: Parenchyma with vessels. Cassettes B6-88: Tumor with capsule. Cassettes B9-810: Extrarenal soft tissue.. Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist. following review of all pathology slides.. Electronically signed out or. 14114
