GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT OVARIAN CYST Received fresh labeled with patient's name and "right ovarian cyst" is a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm pink-tan. cystic soft tissue fragment. A section is submitted for frozen section in FSA1 and the remainder of the specimen is submitted in cassette A2. B. LEFT OVARIAN CYST Received fresh labeled with patient's name and "left ovarian cyst" is a 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm pink-tan soft tissue fragment. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in FSB1.. C. LEFT COLON, SIGMOID, UPPER RECTUM Received fresh and labeled with patient's name and "left colon, sigmoid and upper rectum" is a segment of colon and rectum, measuring 20 cm in length and 6 cm in open circumference. The serosa is smooth. There is a pink-tan fungating mass 4 x 5 x 3 cm, located 4 cm from the rectal margin and 9.5 cm from the colonic margin. It appears to invade into the muscularis propria. There is a 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. polyp located 0.5 cm from the mass towards the proximal colonic margin. Sixteen possible lymph nodes are found ranging in size from 0.4 to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1: colonic margin C2: rectal margin C3-C5: mass and deep margin C6: mass with polyp C7: representative sections of normal appearing colonic mucosa C8: five possible lymph nodes C9: five possible lymph nodes C10: four possible lymph nodes C11-C13: one bisected lymph node each D. DISTAL DONUT Received in formalin and labeled with the patient name and "distal donut" is a ring of tan mucosa tissue measuring 0.9 cm in length with an outer circumference of 1.6 cm. It is bisected and there is a stapled surgical line present. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette D1. E. PROXIMAL DONUT Received in formalin and labeled with the patient name and "proximal donut" is a ring of tan mucosa tissue with an outer circumference of 1.9 cm and measuring 0.8 cm in width. There are blue sutures present throughout the specimen. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette E1.. F. SMALL BOWEL NODULE Received fresh for frozen section evaluation labeled with the patient's name and "small bowel nodule excision" is a fragment of tan soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The tissue is bisected to show a firm white nodule measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in a cassette FSF1. ADDENDUM: ANALYSIS OF MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN EXPRESSION MLH1 Expression: Present MSH2 Expression: Present MSH6 Expression: Present PMS2 Expression: Present Expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 in the tumor was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Peritumoral lymphocytes and normal glands serve as internal positive controls expressing MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Testing for Microsatellite Instability has been ordered. The results will be issued in a separate report.
