Size: 3.9 x 3.8 x 1.6 cm per gross measurement Extent of invasion: Angiolymphatic: not identified; however, multiple lymph nodes are positive in subsequently submitted sections Adjacent subsite: not applicable Vocal cord fixation: not identified Into/through cartilage: invasive carcinoma invades epiglottic cartilage but not thyroid cartilage Outside the larynx: tumor involves hyoid bone P16 IHc status: pending (H3) HR Hpv ISH status: pending (H3) In situ carcinoma: present Surgical Margins: Negative but very close (<l mm) from blue inked right margin. Black inked left margin is 2 mm from the invasive carcinoma and anterior is 6 mm from invasive carcinoma. Inferior tracheal margin is negative. Mucosal margins are negative for squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Lymph nodes: see additional sections Other significant findings: - Perineural invasion present AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT4a pN2c pMx NotE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Comment: In specimen G, bland appearing thyroid epithelium is present in the subcapsular sinus of two lymph nodes. No parenchymal involvement is identified, and no nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma are identified. This may represent benign

Specimen fixation: Formalin. Type of specimen: Total laryngectomy with attached anterior strap muscles.. Size of specimen: 8.1 cm superior to inferior, 5.2 cm right to left, 3.2 cm anterior to posterior.. Orienta.ion of specimen: Right/blue, left/black,. vollecula/yellow and anterior/midline green. Tumor description: Well demarcated, centrally ulcerated with peripherally raised firm white borders.. Location of tumor: Supraglottis involving the bilateral false cords and extending across the midline to the right and left aryepiglottic fold.. Tumor size: 3.9 cm superior to inferior x 3.8 cm right to left x 1.6 cm in thickness.. Extent of tumor: The tumor involves both right and left false cords and the anterior commissure. It extends to the right and left aryepiglottic folds and creeps up onto the epiglottis. The vallecula is grossly unremarkable. The hyoid bone is present and unremarkable. The horns of the thyroid cartilage are present and grossly unremarkable. The true cords in the subglottic region are unremarkable. The pyriform sinuses are unremarkable with the excepticn of undermining tumor. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a solid white cut surface with extension into the soft tissues of the epiglottis extending antericrly towards the vallecula (0.3 cm from the vallecula margin (H4), extension to the underlying thyroid cartilage but does nc: appear to invade the thyroid cartilage, the anterior neck mussles are freely movable over the tumor, bilaterally. The tumor u:ndermines the mucosa of the right and left aryepiglottic folds. The subglottic region is grossly unremarkable. The hyoid bone is intact and the tumor is freely movable over the hyoid bone. Distance of tumor from surgical margins: The mucosa component of the tumor comes within 0.9 cm of the right pyriform sinus margin, 1.2 cm from the left pyriform sinus margin, 2.1 cm from the antarior vallecular margin, 3.3 cm from the inferior trachea. ring margin, 0.2 cm from the blue inked right anterior

soft tissue margin, 0.3 cm from the black inked left anterior soft tissue margin, and 0.4 cm from the green inked anterior midline margin. Description of remainder of tissue: The subglottis is lined by grossly unremarkable mucosa. The anterior strap muscles are unremarkable. No thyroid gland is identified. Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor is given to tissue procurement.. Lymph nodes: Submitted separately. Digital photograph taken: Yes Block Summary: Inking: right/blue, left/black, vallecula/yellow and anterior midline/green H1 - En face tracheal margin H2 - Perpendicular sections of right aryepiglottic fold into pyriform sinus H3 - Perpendicular sections of left aryepiglottic fold into pyriform sinus H4 - Epiglottis and vallecula H5 - Right glottis. H6 - Left glottis (contains thyroid cartilage) H7 - Anterior commissure. H8 - Perpendicular sections of green inked anterior midline, black inked left, blue inked right strap muscle margin. H9 - Remainder of right superior mucosal margin, en face H10 - Remainder of left superior mucosal margin, en face Hll - Perpendicular section of anterior midline hyoid bone beneath tumor (not grossly involved) (decal) Addendum For immunohistochemistry.. Addendum Comment. P16 is positive and Hpv high risk is negative by Ish in a. representative section of invasive carcinoma (H3). TTF-1 and thyroglobulin are attempted on G3 to highlight the foci of thyroid glands within lymph nodes; however, both foci. are cut through and immunohistochemistry is not contributory. The previous diagnoses are unchanged.
