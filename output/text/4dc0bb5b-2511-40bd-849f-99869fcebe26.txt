It consists of a portion of ureter measuring 0.2 cm in length by 0.3 cm in diameter.  The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette AFs. B The specimen is received fresh from the o.R. and labeled "Left distal ureter F/s". It consists of a portion of ureter with attached fat measuring 0.3 cm in length by o.4 cm in diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette BFs. C:  The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Bladder/prostate". It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring 19 x 14.5 x 5 cm. Attached is a peritoneal segment measuring i8.5 x 14.5 x 0.1 cm..  The peritoneum is smooth and glistening.  The prostate measures 5 x 4.5 x 3 cm with attached right seminal. vesicle which measures 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures 2.1 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm.  Also contiguous is a right distal ureter which measures 6 cm in. length and 0.6 cm in circumference, and the left ureter measures 6.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in circumference. The bladder measures 8 x 7 x 4 cm. Opening the which occupies the anterior wall and the right lateral wall, that comes within 1 cm from the right ureterovesical junction.  The tumor grossly involves the bladder wall and comes to within o.2 cm from the inked serosal margin. The uninvolved bladder wall measures 0.4 cm in thickness..  The urethra measures 3 cm in length and 0.9 cm in circumference with normal-appearing mucosa.. The outer surface of the prostate is inked black with superimposed red on the right side. Sectioning of the prostate reveals multiple pink-tan soft nodules up to o.4 cm in greatest diameter. Sectioning of the perivesical fat reveals a 2 x 1 cm firm area on the perivesical fat. At the request of the surgeon; an intraoperative gross consultation was performed in order to aid in the care of this patient.  Representative sections are submitted in 39 cassettes. D:  The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "r. para caval lymph nodes".. It consists of a 6 x 4 x 1 cm fatty tissue fragment. Sectioning reveals one lymph node which measures 1.s cm in greatest diameter. Totally embedded in three cassettes. E:  The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "R. common iliac L. nodes". It consists of a 3 x 3 x 2 cm matted lymph nodes with surrounding fat. Totally
