Clinical Information The patient is a  -year-old male with clinical diagnosis of colon cancer, undergoing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.. Gross Description A. The specimen is received fresh intraoperatively for consultation from. , labeled with the patient's name and designated on the requisition as "right colon, frozen for margins, rest routine," and consists of a segment of right colon measuring 6.5 cm in length and averaging 5 cm in diameter with an attached portion of ileum, measuring 8.5 cm in length and averaging 3 cm in diameter. The appendix is present and measures 7.2 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm and appears slightly dilated in its midportion. The specimen is opened to reveal a large polypoid fungating mass measuring 11.2 x 6.8 x 1.9 cm, which involves the cecum and a small portion of the terminal ileum. The mass is 8 cm from the proximal margin at its closest point and 6.5 cm from the distal margin at its closest point. A shave of the distal margin is frozen. The frozen section diagnosis by is "DISTAL MARGIN, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA." The intraoperative consultation diagnosis is communicated to the operating room at After frozen section, the area under the tumor is inked black and the tumor is serially sectioned to reveal that it appears to extend through the colonic wall and into the pericolonic fat, but not to the inked margin. Additionally, there is a large mass, consistent with matted lymph nodes, in the pericolonic fat, which measures 6.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. The specimen is representatively submitted as follows: 1 -2 shave of distal margin (frozen residues) 3 shave of proximal margin 4 base of appendix and tip, bisected. 5 representative sections from midsection of appendix (appears dilated) 6-8 tumor with apparent extension into pericolonic fat 9 - 10 tumor with relationship to inked margin Page 2 of 3
