FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued) : ** Report Electronically Signed Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: year old female with right breast invasive cancer PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast invasive cancer. POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast invasive cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh labeled with patient's name designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE" is a 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm lympn node with attached fibrous fatty tissue. Specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette one. B. Received fresh labeled with patient's name designated "NON-SENTINEL LYMPH NODE" are two irregular portions of presumed previously intact lymph node each measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.1 cm. Sectioning reveals uniform tan and whtie cut surface. Specimen entirely submitted in three cassettes as follows: B1-B2: first portion of node (match of B1 submitted in Ocr for CBcp protocol) B3: remaining portion of lymph node. C. Received fresh labeled with patient's name designated "RIGHT BREAST LUMPEcTOMy" consists of an irregular portion of fibrofatty tissue oriented with single stitch medial and two stitches superior. The specimen measures 10 cm medial to lateral, 7 cm anterior to posterior and 3~cm superior to inferior. Superficial surface displays an 8 x 4 cm lightly pigmented skin ellipse with centrally located fimr inverted nipple. No discharge or scar is identified. Specimen is inked as follows: superior blue, inferior green, medial red, lateral yellow, posterior black. Serial sections reveal well defined 2.7 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm firm pink white gritty mass subadjacent to and involving the nipple. Surrounding breast tissue is fibrofatty and otherwise unremarkable.
