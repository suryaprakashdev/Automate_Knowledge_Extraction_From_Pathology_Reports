Other Related Data: Billing Type: Financial Number: Clinical Diagnosis & History: Left renal mass. Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Left kidney and adrenal gland 2: SP: Superhilar periaortic lymph node  3: SP: Para-aortic lymph node DIAGNOSIS: 1) KIDNEY, LEFT; RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY: RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE II/IV. THE PATTERN OF GROWTH IS ACINAR.  THE TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER IS 12.O CM. THE TUMOR EXTENDS THROUGH THE RENAL CAPSULE BUT IS CONFINED WITHIN GEROTA'S FASCIA, NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR. THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIONEY SHOWS A SINGLE CYST, 2.O CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. THE ADRENAL GLAND IS UNREMARKABLE. 2) LYMPH NODE, SUPERHILAR PERIAORTIC; EXCISION: - THREE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (O/3). 3) LYMPH NODE, PARA-AORTIC; EXCISION: TEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (O/1O) (SEE NOTE). NOTE: SOME OF THE LYMPH NODES SHOW GRANULOMATOUS LYMPHADENITIS FEW OF THE GRANULOMAS SHOW NECROSIS. SPECIAL STAINS FOR MICROORGANISMS WILL BE REPORTED AS AN ADDENDUM. A BENIGN VASCULAR LESION IS IDENTIFIED IN THE PERIRENAL ADIPOSE TISSUE. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVALUATION TO FOLLOW. Page 1 of 4

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled, #Left Kidney and Adrenal Gland". It consists of a product of a left radical nephrectomy weighing 1, 050 grams and measures 17.0 cm from superior to inferior, 14.0 cm from medial to lateral and. 8.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The periadrenal adipose. tissue in the superior aspect is serially sectioned to reveal a adrenal gland which measures approximately 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. Serial sectioning reveals unremarkable, cut surfaces. Approximately, 3.0 cm medial to the adrenal gland is a perirenal. lymph node which measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The renal vein is patent, the attached segment of ureter measures approximately 10.0 cm and is patent throughout. The ureter is opened and unremarkable. Serial sectioning reveals the mass measures 12.0 x 11.5 x 8.0 cm. Cut surfaces are yellow-orange and focally hemorrhagic. Focal area of tan-white, fibrous regions are identified. In the superior pole is a simple renal cyst which measures 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. It occupies approximately 80% of the kidney.  The fibrous component represent approximately 20% of the tumor. Sunmary of Sections: Fsc - frozen secti.on control A - adrenal. IN - 1ymph node UM - ureteral margin VM - vascular margin R - representative section C - cyst r - tumor 2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled, "Super Hilar peri-aorti.c lymph node". It consists of multiple lymph nodes. measuriny 6.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified. Summary of Sections: IN -- lymph node LNB - lymph node bisected 3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "para-aortic Lymph node". It consists of an aggregate of lobulated adipose tissue and possible lymph nodes which measure 6.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified. Summary of Sections: L - lymph nodes intact LB - lymph node bisected Histo Stain Results/Comments: Stain/Procedure Name Result Comment Page 2 of 4
