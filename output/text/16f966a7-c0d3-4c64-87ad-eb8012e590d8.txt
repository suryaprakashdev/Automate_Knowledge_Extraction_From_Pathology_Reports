FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient:. Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued) : This case is amended to change the lymph node assessment to the above from a prior assessment of "LYMPH NODES: 18 NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.", and to change the stage to T2 N0(i+) frOm T2 NO. Dr lymph nodes on this patient to coilaborate with the peT findings of a requested additional evaluation of the. positive node, so the nodes in Al0, All, A12, A19 and A20 were evaluated with keratin. In Alo, the node originally showing pericapsular lymphatic involvement, the keratin shows individual cells and one subcapsular cluster of tumor cells less than 0.2 mm in diameter. Dr was informed of this change in report today by email.. ORIGINAL COMMENT:S The tumor was too large for microscopic measurement, so exact measurement is not possible. Some of the Dcis component may have been included in the gross measurement, but the bulk of tumor is infiltrative and represents at least a T2 lesion. Slide Aio contains a lymph node with lymphvascular space invasion just outside of the capsule. We are interpreting this as a negative node. This report was amended patient history listing her age incorrected as. pathologic stage was changed from N1 to No, another typographical error. years. Additionally, the ** Report Electronically Signed Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: year old female with invasive ductal carcinoma of right breast and positive for axillary lymph nodes. Presents for modified radical mastectomy. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh consists of a 504 gram right mastectomy specimen single stitch medial and double stitch superior. Specimen measures 24 cm superior. to inferior, 21 cm medial to lateral, and 3 cm anterior to posterior. The. ightly pigmented skin ellipse measures 12 x 5 cm, centrally located Page 2.

No scars identified.  Superficial upper outer quadrant is inked blue and deep margin. inked black. Specimen serially sectioned to reveal fairly well circumscribed pink firm mass measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The mass shows focal hemorrhage and lies within a bed of dense, diffusely nodular, focally necrotic fibrous tissue. The mass is located 1 cm from deep margin and 0.5 cm from blue superficial margin. Remaining tissue shows scattered cysts measuring up to 0.4 cm. Multiple indurated foci are also seen within the upper inner quadrant and~lower inner quadrant. A 0.7 cm lymph node is seen within the upper outer quadrant.. A separately received portion of axillary tail measures 10 x 3 x 1.0 cm and oriented with stitch on high end. Five lymph nodes are identified measuring 0.7 to 1.0 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:. Al: skin A2: mass, central A3: margin A4: lateral mass A5: upper outer quadrant A6: lower outer quadrant A7: lower inner quadrant A8: upper inner quadrant A9: intramammary lymph node Al0: two high axiliary lymph nodes bisected. Al1: two mid axillary lymph nodes bisected. A12: one low axillary lymph node A13: nipple Al4-Al7: upper outer quadrant mass lateral to medial. A18: high axillary lymph node A19: middle axillary lymph node A20: low axillary lymph node. 20cr B.
