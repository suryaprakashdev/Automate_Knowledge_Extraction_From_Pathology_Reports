Number examined: Number involved: 16 DISTANT METASTASIS (pM): Not applicable Gross Description Received are specimen containers A to c. All reauisitions and specimen containers are. The cassettes and AP labelled with the patient's name, identifiers are labelled with the surgicds sumber. The A. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. container is designated " Gallbladder" and consists of an unopened gallbladder, measuring. 11.0 cm in length x 5.0 x 3.5 cm. The outer peritoneal surface is smooth and unremarkable. The lumen contains green mucoid bile as well as an oval, slightly lobulated. gallstone, measuring 2.7 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm. On fracturing the stone has a typical crystalline appearance of a cholesterol stone. The mucosa shows a focal sessile polypoid.

Page 3 of 4 area, 0.4 cm in greatest dimension, but is otherwise velvety and smooth and the gallbladder wall has a thickness of 0.2 cm.A small cystic duct lymph node, 0.7 cm in. greatest dimension is present adjacent to the cystic duct resection margin. Sections are taken as follows:. Al. resection margin with cystic duct lymph node as well as section from fundus A2. sections of body with small polypoid protrusions B. Specimen is received in formalin. The container is designated as " 8A node" and consists of a old fragment of firm, grey tan tissue, measuring 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm. Bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette.. c. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container is designated as  " Whipple specimen". This consists of a pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen, the segment of distal stomach and small bowel, measuring 17.0 cm in length. The head of pancreas measures approximately 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. The neck of the pancreas is painted blue, the uncinate process margin is painted Orange. The mucosa of the duodenum is unremarkable with no tumor. The ampulla of Vater is unremarkable. The common bile duct is opened in the fresh state revealing a branching at the superior edge of the pancreas where the cystic c duct joins the common hepatic duct. The common bile duct, measures 3.5 cm in length. The attached portion of cystic duct, measures 2.7 cm and the attached portion of common hepatic duct, measures approximately. 1.0 cm.  The mucosal surface of the ducts are unremarkable. A coronal section into the head of pancreas reveals a firm tumorish mass occupying much of the head of pancreas,. with dimensions of 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The tumor appears to approach close to the inferior and uncinate margins, but small portion of pancreatic tissue superior to the. tumor and extending to the pancreatic neck resection margin has a fibrous consistency. The section of soft tissue around the head of pancreas reveals scatter lymph nodes.. Sections are taken as follows: C1. proximal resection margin common bile duct. C2. proximal resection margin cystic duct C3. pancreatic neck resection margin, en face C4-6. sections of ampulla of vater with underlying tumor. C7-10. tumor including uncinate margin and posterior soft tissue margin C1l. possible lymph nodes in a fatty tissue operative curvature. C12-14. three possible large lymph nodes along superior aspect of head of pancreas C15. three lymph nodes in gastroduodenal region C16. proximal resection margin/antral mucosa C17. gastroduodenal junction. C18/19. distal resection margin ducdenum Microscopic Description.  Sections show mild acute and chronic inflamnation involving the gallbladder with focal polypoid protrusions in the mucosa bed without any evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. The cystic duct lymph node shows slight granulomatosis and is negative for malignancy. B. Sections show lymph node tissue with lipogranulomatosis. There is no evidence of. malignancy. C.  There is an invasive well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving much of the head of the pancreas. The carcinoma invades through the muscularis propria in the. vicinity of the comnon bile duct, but does not reach the duodenal mucosa. The common bile duct mucosa is partly effaced by the invasive carcinoma. The tumor shows prominent perineural invasion and extends intc peripancreatic adipose tissue.  The tumor lies close. to the uncinate resection margin, but there is a narrow rim of fatty tissue with a clear margin of approximately 0.2 cm. 'The posterior retroperitoneal margin is clear as well. The pancreatic neck margin shows prominent fibrosis with loss of pancreatic tissue or

Page 4 of 4 chronic pancreatitis, possibly related to the development of carcinoma. No calcifications are present.  The section from the proximal bile duct and cystic duct margins show mild inflammation and reactive changes, but no sign of dysplasia or malignancy. The carcinoma invades directly into two peripancreatic lymph nodes regarded as positive for nodal involvement, although distant lymph nodes do not show tumor.
