S.ite.: Madsler Nos C47.9 2 - Right obturator. 3 - Right external ileac. RO 4/3i>|i4 4 - Left distal ureteric margin.. 5 - Right distal ureteric margin.. CLINICAL DETAILS Bladder cancer. Clinically involved obturator nodes right, cystectomy & right lymphadenectomy. MACROSCOPY 1 - Cysto-prostatectomy specimen measuring 125 mm supero-inferiorly x 110 mm medio-lateral x 65 mm antero-posteriorly. The prostate measures 30 mm superior to inferior and 45 mm medial to lateral. On sectioning there is a tumour situated on the right side. The tumour abuts the perivesical fat and measures 20 mm x 6 mm. The background mucosa appears haemorrhagic and possibly abnormal. The prostate shows nodularity with the most prominent nodule extending towards bladder urethral orifice. The seminal vesicles appear spared by tumour, as well as the prostate. 2 - A piece of fibrous tissue measuring 55 x 38 x 22 mm. Sectioning shows 2 lymph nodes, the larger 40 mm in maximum dimension. Both nodes appear infiltrated by tumour. 3 - A piece of fibrofatty tissue 48 x 20 x 8 mm. 4 lymph nodes are identified, the largest 8 mm in maximum dimension.. 4 - A piece of ureter 7 mm long. All embedded.. 5 - A piece of ureter 10 mm long. All embedded.. MICROSCOPY Specimens 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 The sections of the bladder show grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma that extends into the perivesical fat. Perineural and vascular are present. The ureteric, urethral and soft tissue margins are clear. The prostate shows areas of granulomatous inflammation which would be in keeping with BCG treatment. The background urothelium is reactive but no carcinoma in situ is identified. 6 lymph nodes have been identified. 2 right obturator nodes contain metastatic tumour while 4 right external iliac nodes are negative.
