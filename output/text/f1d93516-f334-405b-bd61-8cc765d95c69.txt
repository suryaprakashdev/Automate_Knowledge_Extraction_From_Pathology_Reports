Other findings: gynecomastia, biopsy site changes See report of prior biopsy ( ) for results of ER, PR and HER2 immunohistochemical studies AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pNO Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information. available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and. additional information. C: Lymph nodes, right axillary, removal - No evidence of metastatic carcinoma in 13 lymph nodes (0/13) - See comment. Comment: The axillary lymph nodes reveal lymphoid paracortical expansion, which is favored to be reactive in nature by H & E stains. Scattered pigmented histocytes are present suggestive of dermatopathic lymphadenitis. Additional immunohistochemical stains are pending to further evaluate this. process, results. of which will follow in an addendum report.. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis: Frozen section consultation was requested at. on - by in OR FSAl,A2: Lymph node, right axillary SLN #l, biopsy. - No tumor seen Drs. at Frozen Section Pathologist:, MD Clinical History: with right poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, Grade 3.

Gross Description:. Received are three appropriately labeled containers. Container A is additionally labeled "right axillary SLn #l, hot + blue." The specimen is a 6 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm fatty soft tissue fragment. Examination of the. fat reveals a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm blue lymph node candidate. This candidate is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in blocks FsAl and FSA2. Container B: Specimen fixation: formalin Time in fixative: 28.5 hours Type of mastectomy: simple mastectomy Weight of specimen: 950 grams Size of specimen: 26.0 cm medial to lateral, 26.7 cm superior to inferior, 4.0 cm anterior to posterior Orientation of specimen: Sutures: Short-superior, long=lateral Inking: anterior-blue, posterior=black, lateral=yellow Skin ellipse dimensions: 18.6 x 9.3 cm Nipple/areola: Nipple, 1.0 cm; areola, 3.1 cm Axillary tail: submitted separately Biopsy site: present; Location is central breast/lower outer quadrant; Size: 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm Appearance: Biopsy site (clip identified) is in the center of a white/tan, firm area. Hemorrhage and fat necrosis are noted in this area. Additional residual tumor is present. Discrete Mass(es): present Number of discrete masses: one

Size of mass (es)/biopsy site: 2.5 x 2.0 x 3.5 cm Location of mass(es): subareola/lower outer quadrant Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: The mass. measures 1.9 cm to posterior margin, 8.5 cm to inferior margin, 10.5 cm to superior margin, 2.8 cm to anterior margin and is widely clear of medial/lateral margins. Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: absent Descripti. remaining breast: consistent with yellow/tan fibroad': issue with increased fibrous areas noted in the subareolar area; no other masses are identified. Other remarkable features: none. Tissue submi+: sd for special investigations: yes; Tumor to Tissue Pr. ment Block Summary: (Inking: blue-anterior, black-posterior, yellow=lateral) B1 - nipple. B2 - areola B3 - biopsy site B4 - medial aspect of mass B5-B8 - central portion of mass B9 - lateral aspect of mass B10 - mass to posterior margin B11 - representative dense fibrous tissue posterior to nipple. and anterior to mass B12 - closest skin margin (inferior areola). B13 - upper inner quadrant B14 - lower inner quadrant B15 - lower outer quadrant B16 - upper outer quadrant B17 - mass to normal breast, superior B18  - mass to normal breast, inferior. Container c is additionally labeled "right axillary contents."

The specimen. consists of two fragments of yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue that measures 9.5 x 6.5 x 3.0 cm in aggregate. Within the fibroadipose tissue,. fifteen lymph node candidates are identified. These range in size from 0.4 up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node candidate measures 2.3 x 1.5 x. 1.0 cm. Block summary: C1 - six lymph node candidates. c2 - five lymph node candidates (bisected node inked black). c3 - three lymph node candidates (bisected nodes inked black, blue and yellow) C4 - one lymph node candidate, sectioned. c5 - one lymph node candidate, sectioned C6 - one lymph node candidate, sectioned c7,c8 - largest lymph node candidate, sectioned. Procedures/Addenda: Addendum Addendum Immunohistochemical studies were performed on representative blocks of axillary lymph nodes (c6 and c7) and the results are as follows:. cD20: Highlights many small lymphocytes in a generally nodular distribution cD3: Highlights majority of lymphocytes with focal expansion of the paracortex Interpretation: The immunohistochemical studies highlight an. essentially normal pattern of distribution of B cells and T cells in the lymph nodes, with primary. follicles composed predominantly of small B lymphocytes and a. paracortex populated by predominantly small T lymphocytes. Morphologic and. immunohistochemical findings are compatible with reactive lymph nodes and do not support a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The mild. paracortical expansion can be seen as a feature of dermatopathic. lymphadenopathy.
