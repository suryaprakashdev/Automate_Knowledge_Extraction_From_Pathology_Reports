By Dr. called to Dr. at.  A, B) ana () GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient identification and "sentinel lymph node #1", is a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8- cm fatty lymph node displaying a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4-cm firm white tumor nodule. Touch preparations are performed. The lymph node is representatively submitted in cassette A1. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient identification and "sentinel lymph node #2, right axilla", are 2 tan-pink to fatty lymph nodes, 0.5 cm (B1) and 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm (B2). A touch preparation on each lymph node is performed and the lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: B1: Smaller lymph node B2: Largest lymph node C. RIGHT BREAST LUMPECTOMY Received fresh labeled with the patient identification and "right breast lumpectomy", is an oriented (single - anterior, double - lateral, triple - superior), 153.0-gram, 11.5 x 8.5 x 3.0-cm needle localized Iumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: Anterior - yellow, posterior - black, medial - green, lateral - red, superior - blue, inferior - orange. The specimen is serially sectioned into 9 slices revealing a 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.8-cm infiltrative firm gritty white tumor (mass #1 - 12 o'clock). Mass #1 is closest to the anterior and superior margins at 1.5 cm each. Tissue is procured. There is a second mass/biopsy site, 0.8 cm which is closest to the inferior margin at 0.4 cm and 3.0 cm from the first mass. The remaining fibrous tissue is finely lobulated with interspersed clear fluid-filled 0.2-cm cysts. No additional nodules are identified. A gross evaluation is performed. Representatively submitted: C1: Slice 1, medial margin, perpendicular C2-C3: Slice 4, tumor to closest anterior superior margins C4-C6: Slice 6, tumor to superior posterior margins. C7: Slice 6, anterior margin C8: Slice 6 C9: Slice 6, posterior margin C10: Slice 6, anterior margin C11: Slice 6 C12: Slice 6, posterior margin C13: Slice 7, superior margin C14: Slice 7, anterior margin C15: Slice 7, posterior margin C16: Slice 7, anterior margin

RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1 AND 2 Received in formalin labeled with the patient identification and "right axillary contents levels 1 and 2", is. a 9.0 x 5.0 x 1.8-cm portion of adipose tissue, within which 20 possible lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 cm. There are 2 tan-pink to fatty lymph nodes exhibiting infiltrative tumor, 0.4. and 0.5 cm. Also identified are 3 matted lymph nodes with an overall dimension of 2.2 cm. The specimen is representatively submitted as follows:. D1: Four whole lymph nodes D2: Four whole lymph nodes D3: Three whole lymph nodes D4: One lymph node bisected D5: One lymph node bisected D6: Two whole lymph nodes D7: Two positive lymph nodes D8: Three possible matted lymph nodes D9-D20: Remaining soft tissue E. SUPERIOR MARGIN Received in formalin labeled with the patient identification and "new superior margin", is a 5.0-gram, 6.0. x 2.0 x 0.8-cm oriented portion of breast (suture at final margin). The final margin is inked black and on. serial sectioning, no discrete lesions are identified. Entirely submitted in cassettes E1-E4. F. MEDIAL MARGIN Received in formalin labeled with the patient identification and "medial margin", is an oriented (suture at. final margin) 5.0-gram, 4.5 x 2.8 x 1.7-cm fibrofatty tissue. The final margin is inked black and on serially sectioning, no discrete lesions are identified. Entirely submitted in cassettes F1-F4. G. INFERIOR MARGIN Received in formalin labeled with the patient identification and "inferior margin", is an oriented (suture at. final margin) 4.0-gram, 4.0 x 1.5 x 1.3-cm fibrofatty tissue. The final margin is inked black and on serially sectioning, no discrete lesions are identified. Entirely submitted in cassettes G1-G3. DIAGNOSIS: A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:  METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1), MEASURING 0.4-CM WITH NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION. B. LYMPH NODES, SENTINEL #2, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/2). C. BREAST(RIGHD, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 3, MEASURING 2.2-CM - HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID TYPE WITH CENTRAL NECROSIS AND LOBULAR EXTENSION - SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR - BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS AND GRANULATION TISSUE - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

NOTE: Grossly, two tumor masses are identified, one larger located in the superior anterior and one smaller located in the inferior lateral aspect of the specimen. The larger mass is composed of invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 2.2-cm. The smaller tumor is composed of biopsy site changes with granulation tissue intermixed with clusters of neoplastic ducts located only in the lymphatic channels (CD31 and D2-40 mark involved spaces). Located in the same level (slice #7) more towards the center of the specimen is a microscopic focus of DCiS.
