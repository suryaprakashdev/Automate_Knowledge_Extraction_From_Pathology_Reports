Diagnosis/ diagnoses Resected section of colon (transverse colon) with a colon carcinoma characterized. histologically as a moderately differentiated, partially mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma, located at the base of a tubulovillous adenoma with severe epithelial dysplasia (synonymous: profound intraepithelial neoplasia), extending a max of 5 cm to a. resection margin and measuring 2 cm in diameter at the widest point. Invasive spreading of. the tumor to the submucosa level.. Located 4 cm from the same resection margin there is a microscopically small section or remains of an adenoma of the colon mucosa, tubular in form and with slight epithelial dysplasia (synonym: mild intraepithelial neoplasia). In addition, in the centre of the preparation there is a microscopically small tubular adenoma of the colon mucosa or remains of an adenoma with moderate epithelial dysplasia (synonym: mild intraepithelial neoplasia). Oral and aboral resection margins are tumor-free as is the greater omentum. 18 mesocolic lymph nodes are tumor-free with uncharacteristic reactive lesions. Therefore the tumor stage is pT1 pN0 (0/18) L0 V0 R0; G2
