FOR OFFICIAL USR ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OP 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued) : ** Report Electronically Signed Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: year old female undergoing needle localized lumpectomy of the right breast with sentinel node biopsy. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "SENTINEL NODE RIGHT BREAST" is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm 1rregular portion of soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a single, pink-yellow, lymph node measuring 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The lymph node is bisected. A matched. section of the specimen is submitted in cassette A1 is submitted in for the cbcp protocol. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows: Cassette Key: A1: Lymph node. A2: Adipose tissue. B. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "RIghT BREAsT TIssue" is an irregular portion of soft tissue oriented as follows: short stitch is superior aspect, long stitch is. lateral aspect, and double stitch is the deep aspect. The specimen measures 8.5 cm from medial to lateral, 8.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is received with an accompanying radiograph, and two embedded localization wires. The specimen is inked as follows: superior aspect is inked in blue, inferior aspect is inked in green, the medial aspect is inked in yellow, the lateral aspect is inked in red, the anterior aspect is inked in orange,. and the posterior aspect is inked in black. Serial sectioning reveals three fairly well defined, pink-white masses. Mass #1 measures 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm and is located 0.7 cm from the deep margin. Mass #2 measures 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm, and is located 0.5 cm anterior to mass #1 in approximately the same plane of tissue, and coming to within 0.2 cm of the anterior and lateral margins. Mass #3 measures 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm, and is located 1.0 cm medial to mass #1 and mass #2 coming to within 0.2 cm of the anterior margin. The remainder of the specimen is composed of lobulated,. yellow-tan, adipose tissue admixed with minimal fibrous tissue.
