SPECIMENS: A. RIGHT COLON AMENDMENT REASON This case was amended to correct a formatting error. No other changes were made to this report. SPECIMEN(S): A. RIGHT COLON GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT COLON Received without fixative, labeled "right colon", is an ilealcolectomy specimen including one segment of. 6-cm long ileum, 3.5-cm cecum with attached 6-cm long appendix, 30-cm long colon, with attached mesenteric fat. The colon is approximately 3.5 cm in diameter. Both resection margins are stapled closed. After removal of the stapled line, the specimen is opened and reveals one polypoid ulcerated colonic lesion measures 2.2 x 1.5-cm and elevated above the colonic mucosa to 0.7 cm. This lesion is. 11-cm to the colonic resection margin and 19-cm to ileal resection margin. The lesion appears to be superficial and does not involve the colonic wall. Three additional polypoid areas are present and each measuring 1.2, 1.5 and 2-cm in greatest dimension and are located 3.5, 4.5, and 8.0-cm to the colonic resection margin. The uninvolved colonic mucosa and ileal mucosa are unremarkable. The appendix is. 6-cm in length and 0.5-cm in diameter and is grossly unremarkable. Multiple possible lymph nodes are. present in the mesentery fat. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. A1. Distal colonic resection margin A2. Proximal ileal resection margin A3-A4: Full thickness of ulcerated polypoid lesion with attached mesenteric fat (inked black), bisected A5. Additional section of ulcerated polypoid lesion A6. Sections from polypoid area, 8.0-cm to the colonic resection margin A7. Sections from polypoid area, 4.5-cm to the colonic resection margin A8. Sections from polypoid area, 3.5-cm to the colonic resection margin A9. Sections of ileum. A10. Sections of cecum and appendix A11. Ileocecal valve A12-A14: Random sections of uninvolved colon A15-A27: Multiple possible lymph nodes A28: Tip of appendix DIAGNOSIS: A. COLON AND TERMINAL ILEUM, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY:  INFILTRATING MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA ARISING IN A SERRATED ADENOMA (2.2-CM) - SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NOT INVOLVED  - METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING THREE LYMPH NODES (3/44) SYNOPTIC REPORT - COLON & RECTUM Specimens Involved Specimens: A: RIGHT COLON Specimen Type: Right hemicolectomy Tumor Site: Cecum Tumor Configuration: Exophytic (polypoid) Tumor size: 2.2cm Additional dimensions 1.5cm x 0.7cm WHO Classification Adenocarcinoma 8140/3 Histologic Grade: G2: Moderately differentiated Extent of Invasion: Muscularis propria Margins: Margin(s) uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (Proximal, Distal, Radial) Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: 11cm Margin: distal Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Absent

Perineural Invasion:  Absent Additional Pathologic Findings: three hyperplastic polyps Extent of Resection: R0: Complete resection with grossly and microscopically negative margins Lymph Nodes: Positive 3 / 44 Extranodal extension: Absent Implants: Absent Pathological Staging (pTNM): pT 2 N 1 M x Comment(s): The tumor has a minor mucinous component with occasional, rare signet ring cells present... Immunohistochemical studies were performed in blocks A3/A4-see below- to confirm presence of metastatic disease and assess depth of invasion. Further studies to assess microsatellite instability will. be reported as an addendum.
