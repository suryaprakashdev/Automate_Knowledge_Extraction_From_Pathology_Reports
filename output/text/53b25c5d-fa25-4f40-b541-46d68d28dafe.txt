RIGHT KIDNEY, DEEP MARGIN: Benign renal parenchyma. the attending pathologist, personally reviewed all slides I, and / or materials and rendered the final diagnosis. Electronically Signed Out by Comment Immunoperoxidase stains performed on block A3 show the tumor cells positive for vimentin, CK7, AMACR, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, EMA and foca|y positive for CD10.

Comment: This frozen section diagnosis/result was communicated to and acknowledged by Dr  have performed the intraoperative consultations and issued the above diagnosis. Gross Description A. The specimen is received fresh. Part A labeled *right partial nephrectomy, ink is margin". The specimen consists of a partial nephrectomy which measures 2 x 1.8 x 1.6 cm. Prior to sectioning the specimen is inked as follows: Blue: Renal capsule Black: Parenchymal resection margin.

The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an irregular to roughly ovoid, ill-defined, rubbery intraparenchymal tumor which measures 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The tumor bulges capsule and extends to within less than 0.1 cm of the ciosest parenchymal resection margin. The cut surface of the tumor is variegated, pale-yellow to pink, focally hemorrhagic. No foci of necrosis are grossly identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative section of the tumor in relation to the closest inked black parenchymal resection  margin is submitted for trozen section as FSA1. The remainder of the specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in 6 cassettes,A2-A7 B. Part B labeled "deep margin, ink is margin*. The specimen consists of an irregular, oriented fragment of tan-brown renal parenchyma measuring 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Prior to sectioning the total resection margin is inked black. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section as FSB1. Pr
