Patient Results D: Liver mass Clinical History: Hepatoceilular carcinoma. Intraoperative Consultation: Time Received: 14:50 Time Reported: 15:10 D: Liver mass: Approximately 1 mm from margin (0 blocks) (Gross examination only). MD M.D. (Resident) Gross Description: (A) (lymph node) Received in formalin are two fragments of yellow-tan firm tissue measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm and 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The smaller specimen is inked black and submitted entirely in A1 along with the larger specimen, which is uninked and bisected. (B) (gallbladder) Received in formalin is a previously unopened 9.4 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm gallbladder. The serosal surfaces are purple-tan and glistening. The gallbladder has a wal! measuring 0.2 cm. The mucosal surfaces are green and velvety. The gallbladder contains green bile and four large firm yellow stones ranging in size from 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm up to 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm. A cross-section of the cystic duct and a representative section of the wall are submitted in B1 along with a section of a 1.5 cm greatest dimension lymph node candidate. (C) (liver biopsy) Received in formalin are two tan tissue cores measuring 0.1 cm in diameter and ranging in length from 0.4 to 2.1 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in C1. (D) (liver mass) Received fresh for intraoperative. consultation is a 10.0 x 6.0 x 4.0 cm portion of liver. One side is cauterized and the capsular surface is gray-tan with a smooth serosa but a macronodular surface. The resection margin is inked black. Sectioning through the specimen reveals a yellow lobulated soft tissue mass measuring 7.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm and appears to abut the surgical resection margin but does not appear to penetrate through it. Representative sections are submitted in D1-D5 with D1-D2 containing tumor to the closest resection margin. A representative section of grossly uninvolved liver is submitted in D6.. Microscopic Description: Complete microscopic evaluation has been performed. Appropriately reacting controls have been performed and evaluated for all stains on this case as required.. Histopathology has a list of IH antibodies that are regulated as analyte specific reagents (ASR's). These assays were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the Histopathology Laboratory in the  at the They have not been cleared by the US. Food and Urug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary for the ASR's. These Printed from: Default Page: 3 of 4

Patient Results tests are not investigational and are used in standard clinica! care. In cases where Immunohistochemistry testing is performed. the foilowing antibodies and their respective clones may be used to determine therapy for the patient: EFGR(31G7). ER(SP1), PR(1E2), Her2neu(4B5), CD117(Po!y), CD20(L26). Unless otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for ERPR by IHC, Her2 by IHC and/or HER2 by FISH have been fixed as per ANP.22998 for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 48 hours. ER, PR, Ki-67, p53 are reported as a semi-quantitative percentage of positively stained nuclei. Her-2/neu and EGFR are. scored as follows: No staining at all is scored as (0), weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is scored as (1+), less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells or complete strong staining in less than 30%. of cells is scored as (2+), and strong complete staining in more that 30% of cells is scored as (3+). Ail studies are performed. on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin unless otherwise stated in the report. Printed from: Default End of Report Page: 4 of 4
