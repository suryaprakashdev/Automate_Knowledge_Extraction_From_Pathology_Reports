No metastatic carcinoma is seen in the additional deeper levels of the lymph node in section G35. An immunohistochemistry stain for Pancytokeratin is negative; the control is appropriate. The diagnoses remain unchanged.. This immunohistochemistry test(s) was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory and/or affiliated institution. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal tan-yellow, lobulated and glistening adipose tissue with no grossly identifiable lesions. One representative section is submitted in cassette F. Part G: Received in formalin labeled "SIGMOID COLON AND PARTIAL BLADDER" is a 31.0 cm in length and a diameter ranging from 5.0 to 6.5 cm segment of colon marked with a stitch indicating the proximal end, as oriented by the. surgeon, with an attached 11.0 x 10.5 x 8.0 cm firm, round mass, displaying a 5.0 x 4.5 cm ovoid, hemorrhagic, irregular area most likely compatible. with bladder mucosal resection margin (previously sent for frozen) located towards the distal colonic end. The specimen has an attached 28.0 x 19.0 x 1.5 cm portion of mesenteric fat.. The colonic serosa is tan-gray and granular adjacent to the bladder attachment site. Additionally there are multiple inconspicuous, thin,. irregular foci of possible fibrin deposition disseminated all over the specimen. The mass has minimally attached adipose tissue with focal tan-gray granular areas of possible fibrin deposition.. There is a 9.5 x 6.0 cm tan-pink, focally friable, exophytic tumor involving the colonic mucosa circumferentially with focal areas of superficial necrosis and hemorrhage, located at 3.5 cm from the distal resection margin and at 15.0 cm from the proximal resection margin. A perpendicular section. through the mass reveals continuity with the circumferential colonic mass.

extending through a thick muscular wall, having up to 1.9 cm in thickness. This wall likely represents urinary bladder wall. The bulk mass of tumor. present outside the colon measures 9.5 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm. The mass is grossly extending through the entire colonic wall thickness minimally penetrating grossly into the pericolonic adipose tissue, at 0.5 cm from the serosal lining. The tumor infiltrates the muscular wall, at 1.5 cm from the bladder mucosal margin and at 0.4 cm from the outer bladder wall surface (purple ink) towards the proximal colon end Blue previous bladder resection site. Purple external mass Black mesenteric serosa at the closest point of invasion Section Code: G1: distal resection margin, en face. G2-3: proximal resection margin, en face G4-6: suspicious area of extension at superior aspect of mass adjacent to colon proximally. G7: deepest area of invasion into the mesenteric fat. G8: tumor invading the pericolonic adipose tissue G9: tumor with adjacent uninvolved mucosa at the distal end with underlying soft tissue abscess G10: possible lymph node G11-G16: representative sections of the previous bladder resection margin (perpendicular sections grossly uninvolved) G17-G20: representative sections of tumor at the colonic location G21-G22: colonic mucosa adjacent to tumor toward the proximal end G23-G25: tumor in relation to the bladder wall.

G70-G73: tumor G74: one bisected lymph node G75: one bisected lymph node G76: three possible whole lymph nodes Part H: Received in formalin labeled "NEW PROXIMAL MARGIN (SIGMOID)" is a 5.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm portion of stapled fibroadipose tissue partially surfaced. by mucosa, compatible with colonic origin. The staple line is removed and. the remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in a single cassette. Part I: Received in formalin labeled "NEW DISTAL MARGIN (SIGMOID)" is a 3.1 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm stapled fragment of colonic mucosa. The staple line is removed and the remainder of the specimen is submitted in cassette I. Part J: Received in formalin labeled "ADDITIONAL LYMPH NODE" is a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm round, ovoid portion of tissue which is bisected to reveal a 0.7 cm tan-gray lymph node. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette J.. Pathology Resident Pathology Resident Microscopic Description A-F: Performed. G: Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma composed of highly irregular, tightly packed glandular structures with pleomorphic. nuclei involved by extensive areas of necrosis, desmoplastic reaction and chronic inflammation. The tumor is surrounded by adenomatous colonic mucosa with tubulovillous architecture. The tumor seems to invade the sigmoid colon wall and penetrates into the muscular bladder wall extending close to the bladder mucosal urothelium, but without directly involving it. The bladder mucosa shows extensive hemorrhagic cystitis with subepithelial hemorrhage and congestion and extensive inflammatory infiltrate and edema within the mucosal lamina propria. There is extensive acute serositis. involving the peritoneum with submesothelial polymorphonuclear cells. This acute inflammatory process involves the resection margins, as well. An area of intramural colonic abscess is identitied near the distal aspect underlying the tumor. H-J: Performed. This case was reviewed by the staff pathologist listed below.
