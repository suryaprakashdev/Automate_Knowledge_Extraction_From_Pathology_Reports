Patient: Case #: FInAL SuRGICAL PATHOLOgy REPORT Source of Specimen:  Mass,right renal mass Clinical History/Operative Dx: Right renal Gross Description: Single specimen designated as right renal mass. Initially received in the fresh state for possible. Oncogenotyping studies is a 50 gram portion of renal tissue, 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.2 cm. The likely deep surgical margin is now marked black. The renal capsular surface includes a discreet amount of Gerota's fascia, and is now over-inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a well-clrcumscribed encapsulated appearing tumor mass measuring upwards of 4.2 cm and demonstrating a predominantly delicate, possibly non viable, deep-red, hemorrhagic cut surface. The mass lesion grossly approaches within 0.3 cm of the nearest surgical margin. The grossly uninvolved renal tissue along the deep surgical margin is dusky red and purple. The tumor  mass appears grossly confined and abuts the renal capsule.. A representative portion of the tumor mass along with *paranormar renal tissue is submitted for. Oncogenotyping studies. Representative sections/portions of the mass lesion are submitted for routine histology in A1 and A2 (wrapped in filter paper) with the renal capsule/Gerota's fascia represented in. A3-A4 and surgical margin and tumor relationship in A5-A8. Microscopic Description: Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are retlected in the diagnosis. rendered. office notified of was obtained.
