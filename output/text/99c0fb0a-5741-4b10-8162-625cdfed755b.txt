10. pTNM (AJCC, 7th edition, 201O): pT1c(m), NO, MX Clinical History: The patient is a  vear-old female with invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 1 undergoing right skin sparing mastectomy.. Specimens Received: A: Right breast implant B: Right skin sparing mastectomy. C: Right breast submuscular capsule Gross Description: The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.. A. The first container is additionally identified as, 'right breast implant'. Received is a 12.9 x 12.0 x 0.5 cm deflated breast implant with inscription nith 0.9 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm portion of white soft tissue. Gross photographs are taken. The specimen is for gross only.

B. The second container is additionally identified as, 'right skin sparing mastectomy'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 724 gm simple skin. sparing mastectomy specimen. The specimen is oriented with a double short suture  designating the superior aspect, a double long suture designating the lateral.  aspect, a single short suture designating the medial aspect, and a single long. suture on the nipple margin. The specimen measures 21 cm from medial to lateral, 18.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 4 cm from anterior to posterior. An. L-shaped piece of skin consists of a brown areola measuring 4.1 cm in diameter with an adjacent piece of brown skin extending laterally measuring 6.5 x 3.5 cm, and an adjacent piece of brown skin extending inferiorly from the areola.  measuring6.1 x 3.0 cm. In the center of the areola is a retracted nipple measuring 0.8 cm in diameter. There is a 4x5 cm area of white smooth and glistening membranous area on the posterior surface consistent with implant. capsule. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior superior - blue; anterior inferior - green; posterior - black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 16 slices to reveal a white, firm, 2.0 x 1.9 x 1.9 cm mass in slices 9. A clip is identified in slice 9. The mass is 2.5 cm from the posterior margin (black ink) and 1.5 cm from the inferior anterior margin (green ink). There is a 1 cm white firm area (abutting the posterior margin) just superior to the index lesion.

There is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm ill-defined white firm area identified in slice 8.. This lesion is 2.6 cm from the posterior margin, more than 2 cm away from all other margins and 2.0 cm superior to the index lesion.. The remainder of the specimen consists of approximately extending onto 45 % dense gray-white fibrous breast parenchyma and 55 % lobulated yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses or nodules are grossly identified.. Block summary:e B1: Nipple, serially sectioned. B2: Areola B3: Closest margins to index lesion B4-5: Index mass, slice 9. B6: Index mass, slice 9, with the white firm area. B7-12: white firm area, slice 8, entirely submitted B13-14: Lower inner quadrant, slice 2 and 4. B15-16: Upper inner quadrant, slice 1 and 3. B17-18: Lower outer quadrant, slice 7 and 10. B19-20 Upper outer quadrant, slice 7 and 11. C. The third container is additionally identified as, 'right breast submuscular. capsule'. Received fresh is a 14.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm portion of white and. glistening membranous tissue. A representative section is submitted as C1 yi0/3
