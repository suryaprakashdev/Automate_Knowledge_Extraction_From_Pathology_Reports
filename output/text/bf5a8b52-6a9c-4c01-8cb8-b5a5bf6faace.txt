GROSS EXAMINATION: A: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled aRight distal ureter' It consists of a portion of ureter with attached fat which measures 0.4 cm in diameter by 0.6 cm long. Entirely embedded for frozen section in cassette AFs.. B: The specimen is. received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Apical urethral. margin F/s". It consists of two strips of soft pink mucosal tiseue which together measures 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  Entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in cassette bfs. C:  The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "bladder/prostate". It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen which includes bladder and prostate. Overall, the specimen measures 27.5 x 11 x 4.5 cm with a smooth, glistening, mobile peritoneum which measures 23.5 x 10 by less than 0.1 cm.  The peritoneum does not appear to be involved by tumor.. The bladder itself measures 7.4 x 5 x 3.5 cm. The specimen is palpated to reveal firmness involving the anterior bladder neck and this area is inked black on the outside as well as the entire prostate. The specimen is then opened along the anterior prostatic urethra to reveal a large, wali measuring 7.6 x 3.3 x 2.2 cm with the involved wall measuring 2 cm in maximal thickness.  The tumor approaches within less than 0.2 cm of the inked resection margin.  The tumor is split into half as the result of the opening incision. The uninvolved bladder wall~measures 1.2 cm in thickness and the rest of the bladder mucosa appears unremarkable.  Both ureterovesical junctions are identified and are. patent. The attached ureters are opened longitudinally to reveal an unremarkable mucosa.  The right ureter measures'6 cm in iength and o.s cm in circumference, and the left ureter attached to kidney measures 20 cm in length and 0.6 cm in circumference.  The seminal vesicles are palpated from the posterior side with the right seminal vesicle measuring 2 x 1 x 1 cm and the left seminal vesicle measuring 2.i x 0.7 x 0.7 cm.  The prostatic urethra appears excavated and measures 3.1 cm in length by 2.6 cm in circumference. There is'a focal area of hemorrhage in the posterior wali of the urethra which measures 0.4 x 0.3 cm and which represents a possible biopsy site. The verumontanum itself measures 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Representative sections of the bladder tumor and bladder are submitted in cassettes c1 to c28. The prostate is then serially sectioned from apex to base (1 through 9) to reveal gross hypertrophy of the transitional zone. Sections are submitted in cassettes c29 to c51.. D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Left kidney". It consists of a nephroureterectomy specimen which is attached to the bladder and prostate by its ureter (bladder and prostate represent part C) and overall measures 21 x 12.4 x 4 cm, including the perinephric fat. The kidney itself measures 12 x 5 x 3 cm.  The ureter attached to the bladder measures 20 cm in length and 0.6 cm in external diameter.  The kidney is bivalved and reveals unremarkable cortex and renal medullary tissue. The renal pelvis appears slightly dilated. The junction of the proximal ureter and renal pelvis is narrowed to the extent that it is difficult to open utilizing scissors. Once opened the circumference at the.

C:  Sections of the bladder show multiple foci of urothelial carcinoma in situ. (flat lesion) [C2,3-5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16,18,20,21,24,26]. This includes the trigone (cio) and left ureterovesical junction (cs).  Sections of the mass around the bladder neck show a deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma (C11-26). that focally involves the perivesical soft tissue (C19,25,26). Sections of the attached left ureter show focal reactive changes but no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. No lymphovascular invasion is seen and all .resection margins are free of both urothelial dysplasia and malignancy. Sections of the prostate show unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma (c3o,43),. Gleason's score 7 (3+4). The carcinoma is confined to the prostate without involvement of either the capsule or periprostatic soft tissue. Also seen are several foci of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. (pIN III) [C29,34]. The prostatic urethra shows no evidence of urothelial dysplasia and no invasive urothelial carcinoma is seen in any of the sections of the prostate. Bilateral seminal vesicles show no evidence of malignancy. Resection margins are free of malignancy: D  Sections of the kidney that include the entire ureteropelvic junction, show no urothelial dysplasia or malignancy. The mucosa of the renal pelvis is. unremarkable. *Sections of renal parenchyma show no significant histopathologic change. Six renal hilar lymph nodes are identified, all of which are free of malignancy and show no significant histopathologic features. E-R:  See final microscopic-diagnosis.
