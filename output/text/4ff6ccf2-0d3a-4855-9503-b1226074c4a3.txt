REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (pN): pNX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed. DISTANT METASTASIS (pM): pMX Specimen(s) Received A LEFT KIDNEY Preoperative Diagnosis. Left renal mass. Gross Description A. The specimen is received fresh, labeled *left kidney" and consists of a kidney with partial encapsulated perinephric tissue, 844.0 g. 19.5 x 9.8 x 8.6 cm. The specimen is inked black. The adrenal gland is not identified.. The cut surfaces exhibit an irregular tumor mass involving the cortex and medulla in the superior, middle and inferior poles, 8.7 x 7.6 x 7.2 cm. The tumor is variegated, pale tan-pink and soft with smooth lobulated sections. Marked fibrotic septation is noted. Neither necrosis, hemorrhage or cystic. degeneration is identified. The tumor invades 90% of the calyceal system and extends to the hilum. The renal vein, artery and ureter are probe patent,and not involved by tumor. The tumor does not appear to invade the renal sinus, nor penetrate through the renal capsule to involve the perinephric fat.. The tumor is sharply demarcated from normal parenchyma. Satellite tumor nodules are not present.. The remaining renal parenchyma is pink-tan, smooth and glistening with a well-demarcated cortico-medullary junction, 1.5 cm thickness. The papillae are blunted. A segment of attached ureter. is noted (4.5 cm length x 4 mm diameter). The renal artery reveals no significant atherosclerotic changes. No lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted in A1-A14 as. labeled: A1: Mirror image section of tumor tor Tissue Procurement Laboratory A2. Renal vein and artery with ureter resection margin, tangential A3-A4: Tumor with inked perinephric fat margin. A5-AT: Tumor, renal pelvis, pelvic fat and normal parenchyma A8-A11:Tumor and hilum in relation to renat artery and vein with ureter A12-A13: Tumor with septated fibrotic tissue A14: Normal renal parenchyma The specimen is submitted for Tissue Procurement Laboratory.
