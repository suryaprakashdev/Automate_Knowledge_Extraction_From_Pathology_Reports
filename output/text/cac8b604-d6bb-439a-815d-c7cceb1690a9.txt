Results SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Patient info. Patient Name  Sex DOB  Male Results Physician: SPECIMEN #: ********* ********************** FINAL DIAGNOSIS: LEFT KIDNEY AND LEFT ADRENAL GLAND, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY - RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, PAPILLARY TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE II/IV. - ADRENAL GLAND WITH NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS. Comment: The tumor is present as a 5.0 cm mass arising within the lower portion of the left kidney. The tumor extends beyond the normal renal parenchyma into the perirenal adipose tissue. No extension into renal sinus is seen. The ureteral and renal vascular. margins of excision are negative for neoplasm.  No involvement of the left adrenal gland is seen. UUID:DD45EC6D-A44D-4B7D-9EBA-1ACDEC258FF5 TCGA-IA-A83V-01A-PR Redacted  Report Electronically Signed Out SPECIMEN(S) SUBMITTED: LEFT KIDNEY LEFT ADRENAL GLAND C64.9 CLINICAL DATA: tJ10//13 RENAL MASS GROSS DESCRIPTION: A.  Received is a specimen labeled "left kidney and left adrenal gland". The specimen consists of a left kidney containing a mass and is surrounded by an irregular envelope of fibroadipose tissue. The neoplasm does not appear to extend into the perirenal fat. The specimen weighs 344.50 grams after removing perirenal fat. The. specimen is sectioned from superior to inferior. A mass involves the lower portion of the kidney. On section the tumorous mass is roughly spherical and measures 5 x 5 x 4 cm. It is composed of yellow tissue with foci of hemorrhage and softening. The tumor does. not invade the pelvocalyceal system or the renal sinus. The tumor is sharply demarcated from the renal parenchyma which appears essentially unremarkable. Satellite nodules of tumor are not present in the renal tissue. Dissection of the renal veins particularly those draining the area of the mass does not show intravascular presence of the neoplasm. The adrenal gland is present and measures 5 x 4 x 0.4 cm and weighs 11.31 grams. It is not involved by the mass. A 5 cm segment of ureter is present and is essentially unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in formalin with the following designations: #l ureter and vessels; #2 pelvis; #3 sinus; #4 - #6 tumor in respect to the capsule; #7 tumor; #8 perirenal fat; #9 adrenal gland.
