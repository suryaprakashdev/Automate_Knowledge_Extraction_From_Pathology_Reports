All specimens are placed in formalin at. ************************* Final Diagnosis: 1. Two portions, 11th rib" - No tumor seen. 2. Left renal mass: - Renal cell cacinoma, papillary type (11.0 cm) type I. - Angiolymphatic invasion is not identified.. - Resection margin free of tumor.. 3. Base of mass: - No tumor seen. 4. Lateral base of mass:. - No tumor seen. pT2 No Mx Procedures/Addenda FC Cytogenetics Solid Results-Comments CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS DIAGNOSIS: Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma KARYOTYPE: Abnormal karyotype: 47,X,+7,+17[20] RESULTS: The renal mass was-harvested after three and four days in culture. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and. analyzed, and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The. modal chromosome number was 47, and the cells were missing. chromosome and contained an extra copy of chromosomes 7 and 17. Loss of and trisomy for chromosomes 7 and 17 have been reported in cases of. papillary renal cell carcinoma and are consistent with this patient' s. diagnosis.
