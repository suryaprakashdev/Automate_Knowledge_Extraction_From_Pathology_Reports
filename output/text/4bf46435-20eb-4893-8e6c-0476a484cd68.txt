Page 2 of 3 Appendix: Unremarkable Lymph Nodes: Number with metastasis: 3 Total number examined: 108 Tumor staging (AJcc 7th Edition): pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues) Lymph Node Stage (Acc 7th Edition) : N1b (Metastasis in 2-3 regional lymph nodes). NOTE: THE IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING FOR THE TESTED DNA MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) IS RETAINED IN THE TUMOR. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED SREPOR Electzonically Signed Out *** Special Studies: Result Special stain Comment RECUT Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "total colectonya" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix, ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. The terminal ileum measures 12 cm in length and 3.5 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 95.5 in length with a circunference of nine cm at the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measures 8 cm in length. and averages 0.5  cm in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth..  Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 2.5 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a mass lesion measuring 3 cm in length and 4 cm in width. The mass is located in the sigmoid colon, 85 cm from the proximal margin and 7 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the muscularis propria and possibly the serosa. The depth of invasion is 0.3 cm grossly. The remaining mucosa shows two sessile polyp.. measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0 .3 and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The attached adipose tissue is submitted for lymph node dissection and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. The colon is extensively sampled with representative sections Submitted for permanent sections and for rps.. Sunmary of sections: PM - proximal margin shave. DM - distal margin shave.
