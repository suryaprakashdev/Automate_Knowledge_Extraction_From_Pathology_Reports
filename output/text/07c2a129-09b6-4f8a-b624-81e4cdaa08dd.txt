SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT Not involved Number of nodes examined:1 IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL)AND THAT IHAVE REVIEWEDAND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1).The specimen is received fresh labeled "Right kidney,Perihilar nodes, wedge resection right liver" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter,renal vessels,perinephric fat, portion of liver, and adrenal gland. The total post fixation weight of the specimen is 900 g.The overall dimensions of the specimen are 16.5x 12 x 10.5 cm.The attached ureter measures 3.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 1.0 cm in length and 0.9 cm in diameter.The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is identified, measuring 5 x 2.3 x 0.7 cm.On cut section of the adrenal gland, it shows an unremarkable bright orange cortex measuring up to O.3 cm in thickness.The segment of liver, which is identified on the upper pole of the kidney,measures 6.5 x 3.2 x 0.9 cm.The resected margins of the liver are inked blue.The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a markedly necrotic pink tan tumor measuring 10.5 x 9.5 x 9.5 cm. The tumor extends from the upper pole to the mid pole of the kidney,and on cut section abuts the black inked surface and is located O.4 cm the blue inked surface Further sectioning through the tumor shows a septated cystic appearance, and focal hemorrhagic calcified areas.The tumor appears to be well-circumscribed, and impinges on but does not show definite involvement of the renal pelvis and collecting ducts, renal vein,and sinus fat. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma,with a well-defined corticomedullary junction.The cortex measures 2.5 cm and the calyces appear normal.On complete opening of the ureter,renal pelvis,and collecting ducts, they show unremarkable white-tan mucosa.A single lymph node is identified in the perinephric fat, measuring 1.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimensions. The specimen is photographed.Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections. Summary of sections: UM-ureteral margin VM-vessel margins LN-lymph node,serially sectioned T-tumor TSF-tumor with sinus fat TA-tumor and adrenal TL-tumor and liver TP-tumor and renal pelvis and collecting ducts TV-tumor and adjacent renal vein TC-tumor and black inked surface TN-tumor and normal kidney RS-representative sections of uninvolved kidney parenchyma ADR-representative sections of adrenal gland 2).The specimenis received in formalin, labeled "Paracaval lymph nodes"and consists of a single pink-tan, fatty lymph node measuring 2.7 x2x 1 cm.The lymph node is dissected into four pieces and entirely submitted. Summary of sections: BLN- dissected in four pieces (lymph node) Summary of Sections: Part 1: SP:Kidney,right and perihilar nodesand right liver,radical nephrectomy,liver wedge resection,and lymph node dissection Block Sect.Site PCs Page 2of3
