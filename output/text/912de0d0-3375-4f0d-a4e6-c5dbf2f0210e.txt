Part D, Left breast, excisional biopsy, gross examination: Tumor approximately 0.3-cm from the posterior margin Diagnoses called at. \ and B) and . (D) by Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "sentinel lymph node number one left axilla" is a fragment of red-tan possible lymphoid tissue measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.3-cm. Touch preparation is performed. The entire specimen is submitted, A1. B. SENTineL LympH nODE #2, LEfT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient identification and designated "sentinel lymph node number two left axilla" is fragment of red-tan possible lymphoid tissue measuring 1.3 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Touch preparation is performed. The entire specimen is submitted, B1. C. NON-SENTINEL LYMPH NODE LEFT AXILLA Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "Non-sentinel lymph node left axilla" is a fragment of adipose tissue, 2.5 x 2.4 x 0.5 cm, consisting of one possible lymph node measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The lymph node is submitted, C1. D. WIDE EXCISION LEFT BREAST MASS Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "wide excision left breast" is a previously inked, oriented, 89-g, 9 x 8.4 x 2.5 cm lumpectomy specimen. The single clip designates superior, double-lateral, triple-anterior. ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-blue, inferior-orange, medial- green, lateral-red. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing an irregular friable soft tan mass, 3 x 2.4 x 0.9 cm, located 0.3-cm from the nearest posterior margin (Slices 3-5). A previous hemorrhagic biopsy cavity is identified 0.6-cm from the mass (lateral), measuring 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted: D1-D2: Representative perpendicular sections, medial margin D3: Slice 2, posterior D4: Slice 2, superior D5-D11: Slice 3, entirely submitted, D8 and D10 demonstrating tumor D12-D15: Slice 4, posterior/superior/anterior/superior, tumor D16-D19: Slice 5, D16-D18 demonstrating biopsy cavity  D20-D21: Slice 6, superior, remainder of biopsy cavity D22-D25: Perpendicular sections lateral margin, entirely submitted E. ADDITIONAL NEW MARGIN SUPERIOR LATERAL Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "additional new margin superior lateral" is a previously inked, 6-g, 5.2 x 3 x 0.8 cm fragment of fibroadipose tissue. Ink code: Superior-blue, lateral-red. Sectioning shows no obvious gross abnormalities. The entire specimen is submitted, E1-E2 (superior), E3-E4. (lateral). F. SKIN AT ANTERIOR MARGIN Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "skin at anterior margin" is a slender. fragment of unoriented light beige skin measuring 2.1 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. the entire specimen is submitted, F1. DIAGNOSIS: A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, left AXILLA, EXCISION:I - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

NOTE: Ductal carcinoma is identified in 5 consecutive slices. The tumor is composed of 3 components, invasive, in situ and intracystic. The gross measurement of the tumor is a 3-cm. The largest confluent invasive tumor measures 1.8-cm. A microscopic focus of low-grade DCiS is identified at the inferior surgical resection margin..
