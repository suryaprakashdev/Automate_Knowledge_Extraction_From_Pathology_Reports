MRN: Patient: Sex/DOB:  Female Surgical Pathology Report Collected Date/Time: Accession Number: Received Date/Time: Clinical Information female with left breast cancer on ultrasound core needle biopsy status post. PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer and axillary hydradenitis POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Left mastectomy and left axillary hidradenitis node dissection Gross Description Specimen is received in 4 parts: A. The specimen is labeled "LEFT HIGHEST AXILLARY NODE" and is received unfixed. It consists of one nodule of fatty yellow-. tan tissue with staples measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. On sectioning, there is one lymph node identified measuring 0.7 cm in maximum dimensions. The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette A1.. Time specimen was removed from the patient Time specimen was sectioned and placed in formalin: Ischemic time: 30 minutes B. The specimen is labeled "LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS " and is received in formalin. (The specimen is in the formalin more than  It consist of mastectomy specimen with lymph nodes weighing 480 grams and  measuring 24 x 18 x 5 cm with brown skin ellipse measuring 17 x 4 cm, containing grossly unremarkable 1.5 cm in diameter nipple.. [The skin is tagged with a black stitch designating 12:00]. The posterior margin is composed of smooth fascia which is inked black. The anterior margin of resection is inked with blue ink. The breast is slices in sagittal planes revealing 3 x 3 x 2.5 cm an ill-defined white-tan mass which is 1.5 cm away from the deep fascial margin of resection. This mass is located in the upper outer quadrant (approximately 2:00 position). The remaining portions reveal unremarkable yellow mammary fat with streaks of white-gray mammary parenchyma. An axillary fat pad measuring 7 x 5 x 3 cm. On sectioning multiple lymph nodes are identified. Some lymph nodes are white in and firm in consistency. The largest lymph node measuring 2 cm in greatest diameter. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1 = nipple B2-B5 -- mass B6 = mass closest deep fascial margin of resection B7 = upper inner quadrant B8 - lower inner quadrant B9 = lower outer quadrant B10 -- 6 lymph nodes B11 = bisection of a single lymph node B12 = bisection of a single lymph node B13 = representative sections of 3 lymph nodes B14 = bisection of a single lymph node B15 = representative section of the single lymph node B. 16 = bisection of a single lymph node B-17 =- two small lymph nodes B. 18 = bisection of a single lymph node Time specimen was removed from the patient: Page 3 of 4 Print Date/Time:

The specimen is labeled "AXILLARY LYMPH NODE LEVEL I" and is received unfixed. It consists of two nodular pieces of fatty yellow-tan tissue with metallic staples measuring 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. On sectioning, there are two lymph nodes measuring 0.7 and 1.0 cm in maximum dimensions. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassette C1.. Time specimen was removed from the patier Time specimen was sectioned and placed in formalin. Ischemic time: 11 minutes. D. The specimen is labeled "LEFT AXILLARY HYDRADENITIS" and is received in formalin. It consists of an unoriented brown ellipse of skin with attached subcutaneous tissue measuring 3.0 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm. There is a central old scar measuring 0.4 x 0.3 cm in maximum dimensions. On sectioning, there is a firm white area measuring 1.0 x 1.0 cm in maximum dimensions beneath the scar. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes D1-D2 scar with firm white area.. Time specimen was removed from the patient: Time specimen was sectioned and placed in formalin:.
