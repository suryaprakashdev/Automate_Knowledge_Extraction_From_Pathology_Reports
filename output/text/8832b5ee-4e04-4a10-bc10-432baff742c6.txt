FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Diagnosis: S Left breast, moDifIed radical mastecTomy: - Two foci of invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2 (see comment). - Size: 2.3 cm and 0.7 cm.. TeD - Location: lower outer (4:00) and inner (7:00) quadrants, respectively.. CACF - Associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DciS), intermediate nuclear. C grade, cribriform and micropapillary patterns with punctate necrosis. and without calcifications.. -3 - Size: DCIS spans a region measuring approximately 3.8 cm and. comprises 10% of tumor. Wuost, - Margins of resection are widely free of invasive and in situ tumor (at least 1.2 cm. away). - Focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion identified. - Micrometastatic carcinoma (1.7 mm) identified in one of fourteen axillary LOQ Iymph nodes (1/14); no extranodal extension identified. - Prior biopsy site changes present.. - Uninvolved breast parenchyma with fibrocystic changes and vascular. calcifications. - Benign skin and nipple.. 50. 50 850c/3 COMmENT: The two foci of invasive ductal carcinoma are similar histologically.. Although there was little tubule formation identified on prior needle biopsy of the 7:00 lesion, tubule formation is more apparent on excision (>10%). Thus, the overall. Jo 1/21 histologic grade is Nottingham grade 2 for both lesions.. PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2.. W Type and grade (in situ): DCis, intermediate nuclear grade. Primary tumor: pT2(m). Regional Iymph nodes: pN1(mi) Distant metastasis: N/A. Case # Page 1 Printed: This report continues...

Patient Case # FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Ki-67: Migh (40% positive cells) (4:00). Estrogen receptor: POSITIVE (20% positive cells, moderate-strong intensity) (7:00). Progesterone receptor: Negative (0% positive cells) (7:00) HEr2: Negative (score 0) (7:00). Ki-67: High (65% positive cells) (7:00). Source of Specimen: Breast;left breast radical mastectomy Clinical History/Operative Dx: Breast cancer Gross Description: Single specimen designated left breast radical mastectomy. Initially received in a fresh state for Oncogenotyping tissue harvest is a left modified radical mastectomy weighing 809 grams, and measuring 20.8 x 17.3 x 5.8 cm (not including axillary extension), and the axillary wing extending 10.5 x 9.0 x 4.0 cm. The overlying ellipse of tan-brown skin is 22.8 x 11.3 cm, with a paracentral darken brown, wrinkled areola, 3.2 cm in diameter and a flattened 1.1 cm nipple. A palpable mass is appreciated in the lower outer quadrant. A suture marks the medial apex of the specimen. The surgical margins are now differentially inked as follows: Superior-superficial is marked blue, Inferior-superficial is marked orange, Deep is marked black. The breast is serially sectioned perpendicularly through the medial-lateral long axis, to reveal a partially. circumscribed. dense pink-gray, tumor mass measuring upwards of 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm (slabs 4-6, from. Iateral). This mass is placed in the lower outer quadrant, approximating the 4:00 position and grossly approaching within 1.8 cm of the deep, 2.3 cm of the inferior superficial, 5.0 cm of the lateral extension of breast (not including axillary) and greater than 12.0 cm from the most medial extension of breast.

Patient: Case #: FiNAL SUrgiCAL PAthOLOgy rEPORt tumor includes an embedded hook-shaped metallic clip. Representative portion of the tumor, peri-neoplastic. and normal breast parenchyma is submitted for Oncogenotyping studies. A second, discrete, poorly visualized glistening tan lesion, is within the lower inner quadrant, approximating the 7:00 position, and measuring up to 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and placed within 2.3 cm of the inferior superficial, 2.4 cm of the deep, and greater than 5.0 cm from the most medial extension of breast. A second biopsy site clip is not appreciated.  The cut sections of the remainder of the breast demonstrate prominent ductal tracts in the subareolar Iesion, up to 0.5 cm in diameter, exuding yellow-gray cheesy material, and bluish purulent fluid. Several. blue dome cysts are up to 0.6 cm. Initial examination of the axillary extension of fat reveals fifteen lymph node candidates, ranging from 0.2. cm - 2.0 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node lissue is represented for microscopic evaluation.
