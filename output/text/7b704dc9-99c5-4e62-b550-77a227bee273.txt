Diagnosis/Diagnoses: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins, including a small tubular and a larger tubulovillous adenoma with moderate dysplasia, with an ulcerated, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with infiltration of the perimuscular fat tissue (G3, pT3) and a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with infiltration of the submucosa (G2, pT1) in the proximal large. bowel and with a detectable ulcer in the aboral section of the preparation, evidently with status post complete endocoscopic excision of a tubulovillous adenoma with severe dysplasia (cf. most recent preliminary findings). Tumor-free oral and aboral resection margins. Unremarkable appendix. Tumor-free omental tissue A follow-up report will be made on the lymph node status. Follow-up report: Only twenty-one lymph nodes of up to 0.4 cm in size in the vicinity of the tumor were dissected out from the pericolic fatty tissue after clarification with acetone.. Microscopically these were all tumor-free In conclusion, the previously diagnosed double carcinoma of the right colon can be assigned to category pN0 (0/12).
