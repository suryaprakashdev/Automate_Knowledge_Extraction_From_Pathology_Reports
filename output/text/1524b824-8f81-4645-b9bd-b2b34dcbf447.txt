Comment: This frozen section diagnosis/result was communicated to and acknowledged by in at : on , have performed the intraoperative consultation and issued the above diagnosis. Gross Description The specimen is received fresh labeled "portal lymph node*. The specimen consists of a single roughly ovoid, rubbery lymph node measuring up to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node is bisected and is submitted entirely tor frozen section as FsA1. B The specimen is received fresh labeled "segment 4 lesion". The specimen consists of a single core biopsy fragment of tan brown tissue measuring 0.7 cm in length and less than 0.1 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section as FsB1 C. The specimen is received fresh labeled *superior segment 4*. The specimen consists of a single core biopsy fragment of tan brown tissue measuring 1.1 cm in length and less than 0.1 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section as FsC1. D. The specimen is received fresh labeled *additional superior segment 4*. The specimen consists of a single core biopsy fragment of tan brown tissue measuring up to 0.7 cm in length, which is submitted entirely for frozen section as FsD1. E. The specimen is received fresh labeled *segment 6*. The specimen consists of a single core biopsy fragment of tan brown tissue measuring 0.5 cm in length and less than 0.1 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section as FSE1.. F. The specimen is received fresh labeled *liver resection segment 6". The specimen consists of. an irregular,unoriented fragment of liver parenchyma measuring 6.5 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm and weighs 79.0 grams. The capsule of the portion of liver is tan red brown, smooth and glistening. The parenchymal resection margin is shaggy. cauterized and is marked with black ink. The specimen is serialty. sectioned to reveal an irregular to roughly ovoid, well-defined, solid intraparenchymal tumor nodule, which measures 4.0 x 3.8 x 3.5 cm.The tumoris 0.3 cm from the closest parenchymal resection margin. The tumor partially bulges but does not appear to extend through the hepatic capsule. The cut surface of the tumor is variegated,pink tan to brown,focally hemorrhagic and lobulated. The hepatic capsule overlying tumor is marked with blue ink. Representative sectlons of the specimen are submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the specimen are sulmitted in 6 cassettes as follows:. F1-F3: Tumor in relation to closest parenchymal resection margin F4-F6: Additional sections of the tumor bulging hepatic capsule. hw 1/2114
