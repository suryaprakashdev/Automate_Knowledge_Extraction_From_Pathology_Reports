RUN DATE: PAGE 2 RUN TIME: Specimen Inquiry RUN USER: Lab Database: SPEC #: PATIENT: (Continued) COMMENT(S) (Continued) Distance from closest margin: 6 mm, deep/posterior LYMPH NODES: Number of sentinel lymph nodes examined: 3 Total number of lymph nodes examined: 3 Number of lymph nodes with macrometastasis: 0 Number of lymph nodes with micrometastasis: 0 Number of lymph nodes with isolated tumor cells: 0 Number of lymph nodes without tumor cells identified: 3 PATHOLOGIC STAGING: Primary tumor: pT2 Regional lymph nodes: pN0 (i-) Distant metastasis: Not applicable GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh in the operating room labeled with the patient's name and "right breast lumpectomy" with request for gross evaluation of margins as well as selection of tissue for tissue banking is a lumpectomy specimen which weighs 131 grams and measures 9 x 8 x 5 cm. It is partially covered by a 9 x 1.5 cm ellipse of dark brown skin. Two sutures orient the specimen as follows: long suture is 10:30 and short suture is 4:30. A palpable mass is present within the specimen.. The tissue surrounding the mass moves easily. The specimen. is inked as follows: 10:30-4:30 blue, 4:30-10:30 black. 4:30 edge red. 10:30 edge yellow. and daep/posterior green. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a fairly well circumscribed grayish-tan mass with homorrhagic needle tracts which measures 4 cm in length. 3 cm in dopth, and 3 cm in width. Towards the 4:30 aspect. the tumor has a somewhat more lobulated appearance. The margins are negative with the closest margin deep which measures 1.5 cm. A portion of the tumor is provided to the tissue bank coordinator.  The specimen is placed in formalin with sections to be held overnight for optimum formalin fixation.. A1 skin and underlying breast tissue A2~A3 the tumor as it most closely approximates to green. inked margin A4 tumor as it most closely approximates to blue. inked margin. A5 additional representative section of tumor A6 tumor grossly extending into surrounding ducts A7 section of fibrotic area near the red. inked margin B. In formalin. labeled with the patient's name and "first sentinel lymph node" is a 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm ovoid tan lymph node covered by a small amount of adipose tissue. On cross section. the node is largely composed of adipose tissue. It is totally submitted in blocks B1 through B3 per sentinel lymph node protocol. The specimen was evaluated late in the day and is found to be unfixed. It is held for overnight fixation prior to tissue processing. C. In formalin. labelod with the patient's name and "second sentinel lymph node" is a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm ovoid portion of fatty tissue which contains a 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm fatty lymph node. The lymph node is submitted in block c1 to be held for overnight formalin fixation. prior to further tissue processing. * CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **
