TCGA-CK-4947 Pathology Report Accession Number: o. Report Status: Final Type: Surgical Patholoay Pathology Report COLON, SEGMENTAL RESECT FOR TUMOR Accessioned On: . DIAGNOSIS: SPECIMEN LABELED "SIGMOID COLON (14.5 Cm)": ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON, moderately differentiated (4.0 cm in greatest dimension). The tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolonic adipose tissue and is present at the serosal surface. Lymphovascular invasion is not present.. Non-neoplastic colonic mucosa with no significant pathologic change. Proximal resection margin is free of carcinoma. METASTATIC CARCINOMA in three (3) of twelve (12) 1ymph nodes. SPECIMEN LABELED "DISTAL COLON WITH MARGIN"; Distal resection margin is free of carcinoma.. AJCC staging: T4 N1 Mx CLINICAL DATA: History: Colon cA invading L ureter for palliative resection. Operation: Sigmoid colectomy, left ureterolysis - frozen section.. Clinical Diagnosis: sigmoid colon cancer, left ureteral stricture. TISSUE SUBMITTED: 1. Sigmoid colon - open end is distal. 2.  Distal colon with margin. O.R. CONSULTATION: SPECIMEN LABELED "1) SIGMOID COLON - OPEN END IS DISTAL" (GROSS ONLY): Circumferential lesion consistent with adenocarcinoma. The proximal and distal marqins are free of carcinoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in two separate containers, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.. Part one is designated "sigmoid colon open end is distal".  The specimen. consists of a single segment of colon (14.5 cm length x 3 cm diameter) with attached fat and mesentery (6.5 cm in maximum diameter). Distal resection marqin is 2.3 cm. Proximal resection margin is 2.2 cm. There is a circumferential. mass that measures 4 x 3 x 1.8 cm, appears grossly to invade through full thickness and causes serosal puckering.. This mass is present 4.5 cm to distal resection margin and 4 cm to proximal resection margin. Representative sections are taken for tumor bank. Representative sections are submitted for histologic evaluation. Micro 1-3: tumor at area of deepest invasion, 3 frags. Micro 4: tumor towards distal margin, 1 frag, Micro 5: tumor towards proximal resection margin,. frag. Micro 6: proximal resection margin, en face ? frags,  Micro 7: distal resection margin, 1 frag, Micro 8: 3 potential lymph nodes, 3 frags,. Micro 9: 4 potential lymph nodes, 4 frags,. Part two, received designated "distal colon with margin". The specimen consists of a single portion of colon (1 cm length x 3 cm diameter).  Stapled resection margin measures 4 cm in length. Resection margin is inked in black.. licro 10: stapled resection margin, en face, 2 frags, Reports to: SPECIMEN TYPE: COLON, SEGMENTAL RESECT FOR TUMOR ADDITIONAL SPECIMEN TYPE: SURGICAL MARGIN Page: 1 of 1
