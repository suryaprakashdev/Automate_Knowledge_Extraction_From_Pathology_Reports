Report SURGICAL PATHOLOGY UUID:63266BCF-52D2-4EFC-ADD4-B77288D8101E RGICAL PATHOLOGY tcgA-Qg-A5z1-01A-pr Redacted S PORT Accession No. Date obtained: CAO 4/1/i3 CcF Specimen (Received A. LOW ANTERIOR RESECTION/STITCH MARKS PROXIMAL MARGINS  PROXIMAL DONUT C. DISTAL DONUT BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY: C PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: N6S RECTO-SIGMOID ADENOCARCINOMA OpERATIVE FINDINGS: POSTCPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 814s/3  RECTO-SIGMOID ADENOCARCINOMA Surgeon/physician: Q18.7 PATHOLOGY REPORT Laboratory: GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. The specimen consists of 2l.0 cm in length segment of colon, stapled at both ends with moderate amounts of attached fat. The specimen is received fresh to the frozen section lab for intraoperative gross consultation.. Intraoperative findings are communicated to the surgeon in person.  The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening. There is a firm area of puckering in the mid portion. of the serosa. The serosal aspect with the puckering is inked blue. Opening reveals a 2.8 x 2.5 cm, tan-pink, centrally ulcerated mass with raised borders that is nearly circumferential, 9.5 cm from the proximal resection margin, and 5.8 cm from the distal resection margin. Sectioning through the mass reveals a tan-white,. granular cut surface that grossly extends into the underlying attached mesenteric fat. The mass does not grossly extend to the inked serosal aspect. The mass is 9.3 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The remaining colonic mucosa is tan-brown, smooth and glistening. No subsequent lesions are identified. Sectioning through the attached fat reveals multiple tan-pink, rubbery lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimensions. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al- proximal resection margin; A2- distal resection margin; A3-A4- mass to closest inked serosa; A5-A6- mass to include underlying fat and adjacent uninvolved mucosa; A7- mesenteric resection margin closest to mass; A8-A13- multiple whole lymph nodes.. GROSS DIAGNOSIS: RECTOSIGMOID COLON RESECTION: - TUMOR IDENTIFIED WITH MARGINS APPEARING GROSSLY FAR FROM THE MASS. B.  The specimen consists of a l.8 x l.0 x 0.6 cm, tan-brown, annular soft tissue partially surface by a tan-brown, smooth and glistening.  Sectioning reveals a tan-brown, unremarkable cut surface. No mucosa.

SURGICAL MARGINS PROXIMAL COLORECTAL: NEGATIVE DISTAL COLORECTAL: NEGATIVE  RADIAL: NEGATIVE DISTANCE OF INVASIVE CARCINOMA FROM NEAREST SURGICAL MARGIN: 5.8 CM FROM DISTAL MARGIN. - LYMPHATIC INVASION: PRESENT. - VASCULAR INVASION: PRESENT. -PERINEURAL INVASION: PRESENT. PATHOLOGIC STAGING (pTN) :  PRIMARY TUMOR: pT3. REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: pNIb. NUMBER EXAMINED: 38 NUMBER INVOLVED: 3 ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES: - TUBULAR ADENOMA ASSOCIATED WITH ADENOCARCINOMA. B. PROXIMAL COLONIC DONUT, RESECTION: SEGMENT OF COLON, NO TUMOR SEEN. C. DISTAL COLONIC DONUT, RESECTION: - SEGMENT OF COLON, NO TUMOR SEEN.
