Papillary renal cell carcinoma, multifocal (at least 6 tumors). Please see case summary and comment. CASE SUMMARY FOR NEPHRECTOMY FOR RENAL CELL CARCINOMA: Procedure: robotic-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. Specimen laterality: right Tumor site: lower pole Tumor size: #1 largest: 6.0 cm #2-#6: 0.3 cm, 0.3 cm, 0.1 cm, 0.1 cm, <0.1 cm Tumor focality: multifocal Macroscopic extent of tumor: tumors limited to kidney Histologic type: papillary renal cell carcinoma (largest is type 1). Sarcomatoid features: not identified Tumor necrosis: not identified Histologic grade (Fuhrman Nuclear Grade): grade 2 Microscopic tumor extension: tumors limited to kidney Margins: negative for invasive carcinoma: Renal parenchymal margin: negative (closest 1mm tumor is 1 mm from margin) Renal capsular margin: negative Perinephric fat margin: negative Lymphovascular invasion: not identified Pathologic staging (pTNM): TNM descriptors: m, mutliple primary tumors Primary tumor: pT1b: Tumor more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension, limited to the kidney Regional lymph nodes: pNx: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (tissue in A submitted as a lymph node has no lymph node). Number examined: 0 Number involved: 0 Distant metastasis: pM not applicable. Pathologic findings in nonneoplastic kidney: hypercellular, enlarged glomeruli, globally sclerotic glomeruli, arteriolonephrosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammation Other tumors and/or tumor-like lesions: multiple smaller papillary renal cell carcinomas (as described above) AJCC Staging (7th edition) pT1b(m) pNx pM not applicable Research QC Tumor: 100% tumor nuclei 0% necrosis 0% normal Normal:
