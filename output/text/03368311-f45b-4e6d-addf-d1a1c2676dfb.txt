Specimen is received inked and previously sectioned by Dr.. by 1.i cm firm to hard area which is 0.4 cm from the posterior margin and 0.3 cm from the anterior margin; There is a medial 1.8 by 1.5 lateral to this mass is an area of calcification on radiograph. Section thru this area shows ill defined fibrous tissue, approximately 1.2 by 1.0 by 0.8 cm with white punctate tissue, < 0.1 cm. ADDENDA: Addendum MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: BLOCKS B3 AND B8 SUBMITTED FOR ER/PR AND HER-2/NEU FINAL DIAGNOSIS: My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted material(s) and the final.. diagnosis reflects that 'evaluation.. ER/PR DMUNOPEROXIDASE IDENTIFICATION OF ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS IS CARRIED OUT ON BLOCKS B3 AND B8 DISTINCT INTRANUCLEAR STAINING IS IDENTIFIED FOR ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (9Ot) AND FOR PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (60%). THEREFORE, BOTH ARE INTERPRETED AS POSITIVE. HER-2/NEU C-OrbB2 (HER-2/NEU) IMMUNOSTAINING IS CARRIED OUT ON BLOCKS B3 AND B8 (BREAST CANCER) USING A 1:30O DILUTION OF DAKO'S POLYCLONAL ANTIBODY A485 (DIRECTED AGAINST THE INTRACELLULAR DOMAIN OF c-OrbB2) WITHOUT ANTIGEN RETRIEVAL. DISTINCT COMPLETE MEMBRANE STAINING IS IDENTIFIED ONLY RARELY IN 5t OF TUMOR CELLS. THEREFORE, c-S erbB2 (HER-2/NEU) IS INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE (SCORt 1+). FINAL DIAGNOSIS: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: PREVIOUS REPORTSE A) LEET AXILLARY CONTENTS: ELEVEN (11) LYMPH NODES, NECATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA B) LEFT BREAST, SEQMENTAL MASTECTOMY: INEILTRATING MULTIFOCAL.. NOTTINGHAM SCORE FOR BOTH TUMORS - 8/9 (TUBULES - 3, NUCLEAR ATYPIA - 3, MITOTIC INDEX - 2). INKED ANTERIOR MARGIN AND INFILTRATING TUMOR SXTENDS TO WITHIN O.3 CM OF THE ANTERIOR MARGIN LYMPHOVASCULAR PERMEATION IS IDENTIFIED TUMOR AND NON-TUMOR ASSOCIATED MICROCALCIFICATIONS - CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS BIOPSY - FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES NoTe: Both tumor nodules have similar architactural and cytologic foatures.
