Clinical Diagnosis & History: /o male with incidental right renal mass.. Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Right kidney, adrenal gland and hilar lymph node DIAGNOSIS: 1) KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND, RIGHT RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY: - RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CHROMOPHOBE CELL TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE II/IV. - THE PATTERN OF GROWTH IS SOLID - THE TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER IS 6.8 CM. - THE TUMOR IS CONFINED WITHIN THE RENAL CAPSULE -ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR -VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. (SEE NOTE.) -THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEYIS UNREMARKABLE. - THE ADRENAL GLAND IS UNREMARKABLE. - THE LYMPH NODE STATUS IS AS FOLLOWS (EXPRESSED AS THE NUMBER OFMETASTATIC NODES IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NODES EXAMINED): RENAL HILAR: O/1. NOTE: A REPRESENTATIVE SLIDE WAS REVIEWED WITH DR. REUTER WHO CONCURS I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right Kidney, Adrenal Gland and Hilar Lymph Node". It consists of a radical nephrectomy specimen, including right kidney, adrenal gland and attached perinephric adipose tissue, entirely weighing 550 grams and measuring 15 x 10 x 5.5 cm.The adrenal gland is identified and it measures 4.5 x 2 x 0.7 cm. It is separated from the renal. parenchyma by 2.5 cm of perinephric adipose tissue. The adrenal gland is serially sectioned and appears grossly unremarkable.. The ureter is identified and it measures 2 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter.  Renal vessels are present and measure from 0.5 to. 0.7 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter..  The renal vessels and the distal ureter appear grossly unremarkable.  Multiple hilar lymph nodes are identified, ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.5 cm.  The kidney is bivalved revealing a well-circumscribed, partially encapsulated, tan-beige to light yellow mass measuring 6.8 x 6.5 x 3.8 cm located at the upper pole. Serial sectioning of the mass. reveals cystic degeneration with very minimal hemorrhagic and necrotic areas.The cystic component comprises about 20% of the entire mass and the solid component comprises 80% of the mass. The mass is 0.7 cm from the renal pelvis. The mass appears to be confined within the renal parenchyma and within the renal capsule.  No gross invasion of the vessels or perinephric fat is identified.The cortical-medullary junction is distinct. The cortical thickness ranges from O.7 to 1 cm.The uninvolved renal parenchyma is tan-beige and appears grossly unremarkable. The renal capsule is easily stripped revealing a smooth Page 1of2
