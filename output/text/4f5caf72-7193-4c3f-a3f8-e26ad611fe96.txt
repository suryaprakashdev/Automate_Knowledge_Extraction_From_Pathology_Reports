Left breast, modified radical mastectomy: - Invasive lobular carcinoma, SBR grade II, see pathologic parameters and comment. - Lobular carcinoma in situ, classic type. - Metastatic carcinoma in thirteen of fifteen lymph nodes (13/15); biopsy. site present in one node Breast Pathologic Parameters. 1. Invasive carcinoma: A. Microscopic measurement: 6.6cm (slices 5-11); 20% cellularity. See comment. tad o3 B. Composite histologic (modified SBR) grade: II - Architecture: 3 - Nuclear grade: 2 8sQD/3 - Mitotic rate: 1 C. Associated lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): Sut  fBrsat NoSCso.1 - Within main mass and extending away Q 5/16|13 2. Excisional biopsy margins: Widely (>1cm) free of tumor 3. Blood vessel and lymphatic invasion: Absent. 4. Nipple and skin: unremarkable. 5. Axillary lymph nodes: Positive (13/15) - Size of largest metastatic deposit: 1cm - Extranodal extension: present, largest focus 2mm (multifocal) 6. Special studies (see - ER: Moderate to strong expression in 80% of invasive tumor nuclei. - PR: No expression of invasive tumor nuclei - HER2 antigen (FISH): Non-amplified (ratio: 1.10) 7. pTNM (AJCC, 7th edition, 2010): pT3, N3, MX. Clinical History:. The patient is a year-old female with breast cancer undergoing left breast. modified radical mastectomy. Comment The tumor exhibits 20% cellularity. Although extensive hyalinization is present

in the tumor bed, this feature was also seen on the pre-treatment biopsy. Hence, response to chemotherapy is difficult to assess. Of note, no significant treatment response is seen in the lymph nodes.. Specimens Received: A: Left breast modified radical mastectomy. Gross Description: A. The specimen is received in a single container labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, and additionally identified as, 'left breast  modified radical mastectomy'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1,276.6 gm modified radical mastectomy specimen. The specimen is received oriented with a suture designating left axillary tail. The specimen measures 26.5 cm from superior to inferior, 27.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior to posterior. There is an attached 9.5 x 9 x 2.5 cm axillary tail. On the. anterior surface is a 23.5 x 13 cm tan-white ellipse of skin with a 6 x 5 cm areola and a 1.1 x 1 cm flattened nipple. The nipple-areolar complex reveals no evidence of ulceration or retraction.. The specimen is inked as follows: superior edge - blue; inferior edge - green; posterior - black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 21 slices to reveal a firm, bulging, scallop tan-white to pink 8.5 x 6.5 x 4.2 cm mass in slices 5-13. The mass is 0.7 cm from posterior margin (black) and 0.5 cm from. anterior skin. A biopsy tract filled with gel is present in places 6-7, with clip present in slice 7. The remainder of the specimen consists of. approximately 5% dense gray-white fibrous breast parenchyma and 95% lobulated yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses or nodules are grossly identified. Sectioning through the axillary tail reveals multiple tan-brown, rubbery lymph. nodes ranging from 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4- 2 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Breast specimens are fixed for at least 6 hours in 10% NBF and no more than 72 hours.
