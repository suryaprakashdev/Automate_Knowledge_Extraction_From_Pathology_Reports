UUID:CB9B68D7-7628-4828-9479-4ECFE346AB5C TCGA-OR-ASK6-01A-PR Redacted Specimen Date/rime: DIAGNOSIS (A) LEFT ADRENAL TUMOR: ADRENOCORTICAL CARCINOMA (8.O CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION), CONFINED TO THE ADRENAL GLAND. (SEE COMMENT)A Margin of resection, no tumor present. COMMENT. This large tumor shows diffuse growth pattern with extensive necrosis, and the tumor cells show focal areas of Fuhrman nuclear. grade 3. Clear cells compromise less than the 25% of tumor cells. There are.7 mitotic figures in 50 high-power fields. The overall. features are consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma.. was consulted. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT ADRENAL TUmOR - A left adrenalectomy, 8.0 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm, weighing 0.15 kg., with attached adipose tissue. There is a separate portion of unremarkable adipose tissue, 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm.. The adrenal gland is nearly entirely replaced by a well circumscribed encapsulated tumor, 8.0 cm in greatest dimension.. The cut surfaces are variegated, yellow, tan and red with friable hemorrhagic areas (approximately 40% of the tumor). The tumor abuts the capsule and adjacent adipose tissue.. There is minimal residual normal adrenal cortex and medulla. INK CODE: Black - surface of adrenal gland.. SECTION CODE: A1-A3, hemorrhagic, friable areas of tumor with margin; A4, A5, tan firm areas of tumor; A6-A8, yellow areas of tumor with adjacent adipose tissue; A9, A10, tumor with adjacent residual adrenal tissue; A11, A12, representative residual adrenal tissue.
