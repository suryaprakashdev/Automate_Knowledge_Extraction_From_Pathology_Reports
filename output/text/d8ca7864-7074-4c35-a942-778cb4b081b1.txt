The specimen is serially sectioned and touch preps are taken. Toto A1. B. SENTiNEL LYMPH NODE #2. LEFT AXILLA Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and touch preps are taken. Toto B1. C. LEFT BREAST WIDE LOCAL EXCISION NEEDLE LOCALiZATION: Received in fresh state is a specimen labeled with patient's name and identification number as above and specimen labeled as "wide local excision left breast needle localization". The specimen consists of a resected portion of predominantly fatty breast tissue weighing 122 grams and measures 12.0 x 7.5 x 3.0 cm. Attached portion of skin along the anterior aspect measures 5.0 x 2.2 cm. and skin surface grossly shows no identifiable uiceration. . There is a needle localization wire in place and included radiogram of the specimen indicating the area of density. The margins of the specimen are oriented with sutures, one suture and one clip-anterior, two sutures and two clips-lateral, three clips and three sutures-superior. The margins of the specimen are color coded as folows: red-superior, orange- inferior, blue-anterior, green-lateral, yellow-medial and black-posterior. On serial cut sections, along the off mid portion of the specimen is a tan-white firm tumor measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. with a slightly stellate irregular borders seen 1.5 cm. from the deep margin, 1.7 cm. from the superior, 2.2 cm. from the anterior, 3.0 cm. from the lateral margin and 3.0 cm. from the medial margin. The main bulk of the specimen shows a predominantly fatty breast tissue with occasional narrow strands of fibrous stroma There is no other identifiable tumor focus. Multiple sections are submitted in cassettes labelled as follows: C1 through C10: full section of the tumor with margins C1- tumor with posterior margin C2 -section adjacent to the tumor C3 -includes sections of the anterior margin C4: includes sections with inferior margin C6: includes sections with superior margin C11-C12: sections that includes medial margin C13: additional sections from medial margin C14-C15: sections includes lateral margin C16: includes sections from the inferior/lateral margin C17-C18: one en block section C19-C20: additional sections from tumor without margins D. SENTINEL NODE #3 Received fresh are two pieces of fatty tissue in aggregate measuring 3 x 3 x 1 cm. One lymph node is identified measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. A touch prep is performed and touch prep diagnosis is given. The lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette D1. E. SUPERIOR MRGIN: Received labeled with patient name and designated as *superior margin" consists of a 4.7 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. and weighing 15 grams segment of breast parenchyma. It is oriented with one suture marking true superior margin. The margin is inked. It is serially sectioned and the cross surface shows multiple focal

SENTINEL NODE #4 Received fresh is a piece of fatty tissue measuring 3 x 2 x 0.5 cm. One lymph node is identified measuring 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer s instructions. This. assay was not modified. interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance..

TSS 1D provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in- house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaiuation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medica! literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force.
