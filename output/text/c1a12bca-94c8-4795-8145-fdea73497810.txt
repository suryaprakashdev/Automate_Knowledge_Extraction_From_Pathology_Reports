FINAL DIAGNOSIS: PArt 1: pancReAS, uncinatE, biOpSy -- ADENOCARCINOMA (see comment). Part 2: gallbladder, Cholecystectomy -- CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS. PART 3: GASTRODUODENAL LymPH NODE, EXCISION -- ONE (1) BENIGN LYMPH NODE. PART 4: PANCREAS, HEAD, BIOPSy - . ADENOCARCINOMA (see comment). PARt 5: STOmaCh, DUODeNUm, PANCREaS, bILE DUCT, WhIpPLE RESECTIOn - A. INVASIVE WELL DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE HEAD OF THE PANCREAS (3.8 CM). B. THE CARCINOMA INVADES BEYOND THE PANCREAS TO INVOLVE THE PERIPANCREATIC SOFT TISSUE AND DUODENUM. C. METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IS PRESENT IN ONE OF THIRTEEN (1/13) PERIPANCREATIC LYMPH NODES. D. PROXIMAL GASTRIC, DISTAL DUODENAL, BILE DUCT, PANCREATIC, RETROPERITONEAL AND VASCULAR GROOVE MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. E. PAnCREATiC InTRAEPITHELiAL NEOPLASIA, GRADE 3 (PAnIN-3). F. PATHOLOgiC STAgE; pT3, N1, m1 (SEE,PART 6). PART 6: TRANSVERSE MeSOCOLON, EXCISION -- A. METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE B.  One (1) benign lymph node. PART 7: TRANSVERSE MESOCOLON, LYMPH NODE, EXCISION - One (1) benign lymph node. COMMENT: The biopsies of the pancreas are diagnostic of adenocarcinoma in comparison to the main resection specimen which shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with features similar to those seen in the biopsies.
