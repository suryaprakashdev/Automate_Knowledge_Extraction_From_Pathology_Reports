LT AXILLA SENTINEL NODE #1 F. LT AXILLA SENTINEL NODE #2 PART A  RECEIVED FRESH LABELED. RIGHT BREAST INK MARKS TUMOR STITCH 12 O'CLOCK, IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN WITH OVERALL DIMENSIONS OF 24.5 X 21 X 3.5 CM. THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 6 X 3-CM ELLIPSE OF SKIN. A SUTURE DENOTES 12 O'CLOCK.  ADJACENT TO THIS SUTURE IN THE UPPER INNER QUADRANT IS BLACK INK DENOTING THE TUMOR AREA. THIS AREA IS OVERMARKED WITH RED INK. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT OF THE SPECIMEN IS MARKED IN BLUE, THE DEEP IN BLACK INK. IN THE UPPER INNER QUADRANT, THERE IS A FIRM PALPABLE MASS MEASURING 2.3 X 3.3 X 1.7 CM. THIS IS O.6 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. A RIBBON CLIP IS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THIS MASS. A PORTION OF THIS IS SUBMITTED PER PROTOCOL.S THE BREAST TISSUE CONSISTS OF A MIXTURE OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE AND PINK-TAN FIBROUS TISSUE WHICH PRIMARILY IS CENTRAL AND COMPRISES NO MORE THAN 20% OF THE PARENCHYMA. THIS MASS IS 1.5 CM FROM THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN. ADDITIONALLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER ARE TWO IRREGULAR PORTIONS OF YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 8.5 X 8.3 X 1.5 CM TOGETHER. THIS TISSUE IS GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE AND NO SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A1--NIPPLE AND ADJACENT SKIN (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), A2--SUPERIOR PORTION OF LESION TO INCLUDE DEEP MARGIN (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), A3--THE REMAINDER OF THE FULL CROSS-SECTION TO A2 TO INCLUDE THE INFERIOR ASPECT OF THE LESION, A4--SECTION OF TISSUE IN AREA OF RIBBON CLIP (MIRROR IMAGE TO TUMOR BLOCK), A5--TISSUE TAKEN FROM UPPER OUTER QUADRANT 6 CM FROM THE LESION (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL).
