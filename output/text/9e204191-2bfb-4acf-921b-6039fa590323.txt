This is a piece of tan tissue measuring 10 x 10 x 2 mm. totally examined by frozen section as block Al. B.  This specimen. received in the fresh state from the operating room for immediate gross evaluation for evaluation of surgical margins and tumor banking is a right hemicolectomy specimen. The colon measures 24 cm in length by 6 cm in maximum diameter: the terminal ileum measures 6 cm in length by 2 cm in diameter: the appendix measures 7 x 0.8 cm Present in the ascending colon is a circumferential, tan tumor which measures 5 x 5 x 5 cm distal margin.  Tissue of the overlying visceral peritoneum is puckered suggestive of.  Regional adipose visceral peritoneal penetration. Blue ink is applied to these regions.. tissue attached to the specimen measures 15 x 13 x 3 cm. A representative section of the tumor is submitted for tumor banking. Multiple regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic tumor. the largest measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and exhibiting extracapsular extension of the tumor. The following sections are submitted: B1 appendix and proximal margin B2 distal margin B3-6 - colon mass with blue ink on abnormal visceral peritoneum B7 colon mass B8.9  whole lymph nodes B10-12- representative sections of positive lymph nodes  Portions of the tissue C. This is a wedge biopsy of liver measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm.. appear to be replaced by tumor. A representative section is examinsd by frozen section as block C1. All remaining tissue is submitted as block c2.. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: A.
