FOR ORFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued) : methods. A positive test is defined as easily discernable nuclear staining in more than 5% of the tumor cells. The specimen was evaluated for HER-2/Neu (c-erbB2) overexpression by. immunohistochemical methods (DAko Hercep Test). Staining is interpreted. on a scale of 0 to 3+ with positivity defined as 2+ or greater.  .. with a weakly positive (2+)~Hercep Test are further evaluated by Specimens fluorescence in situ hybridization (Pathvysion FIsh assay) to detect presence or absence of Her-2/neu gene amplification. ** Report Electronicallv Signed Out * CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: {None Given} GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. senrineL Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, and designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER ONE" is a specimen consisting of a 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm lymph node. A small portion was submitted for the. CBcp protocol. 1cins. B. RIghT BReAsr TIssuE Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, and designated "RIGHT BREAsT TIssuE" is a specimen consisting of a 245.0 gram simple mastectomy, 18.0 cm x 13.5 cm x 3.0 cm in dimension. There is a 15.0 cm x 4.0 cm ellipse of nipple-bearing skin. The deep margin is. inked in black. On sectioning, a i.8 cm tumor is identified in the mid-center portion of the breast. The tumor abuts, but does not grossly involve the deep margin. The remaining tissue is extensively fibrosis with admixed fat. Sections of tumor, grossly normal fibrous breast tissue, and skin harvested for the cBcp protocol; mirror images for Histology are as follows: Slide Key: B1: Tumor(cbcp); B2: Fibrous tissue, 1.0 cm medial to tumor. (CBcp); B3: Fibrous tissue, 2.0 cm medial to tumor(cBcp); B4: Fibrous tissue, 5.0 cm medial to tumor(cbcp); B5: Skin, near medial tip (cacp); Page 2 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
