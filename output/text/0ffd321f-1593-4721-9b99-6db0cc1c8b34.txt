The nipple dermis is involved by invasive ductal carcinoma. Mucinous carcinoma spans 2.5 mm and does not involve the inked margin.. All foci of invasive carcinoma (ductal and mucinous) are 3R positive, HER2 negative. DCIS is present and is 3.6 cm from the closest inked margin. Sentinel lymph nodes: 2/3.. Non-sentinel lymph nodes: 1/1. Total lymph nodes: 3/4. Type of metastasis: macrometastasis (6 mm) to an intramammary lymph node 1.

Non-sentinel node, left axilla, excision:  One benign lymph node (0/1). BREAST, LEFT, SIMPLE MASTECTOMY: Invasive Carcinoma: Ductal, NOs type Focal mucinous carcinoma (see note) Histologic Grade: II/ill: Minimal or no tubule formation (< 10% of tumor) Nuclear Grade: III/ill (marked variation in size and shape) Tumor Size: Two foci (size specified below) the invasive ductal carcinoma spans 28 mm and 2 mm. Ductal carcinoma in situ (cis): Present DCIs, Architecture: Solid  Papillary DCIs Nuclear Grade: High Necrosis in DcIS:  Minimal Extensive intraductal component (>25% of tumor mass): Not Identified Lobular Neoplasia: Lobular carcinoma in situ (Lcis), classical type Location of Invasive Carcinoma: Upper inner quadrant (UIQ) Lower inner quadrant LIQ Location of DcIs: Upper inner quadrant (UIQ) Lower inner quadrant (LIQ) Nipple Involvement: Invasive carcinoma involves the nipple stroma Skin: Tumor emboli are present in dermal lymphatic channels The examined skin margins are uninvolved by carcinoma Calcification: In benign breast tissue.

Present Page Surgical Margins: Invasive carcinoma is 36 mm from the closest margin. DCIs is 36 mm from the closest margin Benign Breast Tissue:. Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) Fibrocystic changes, including apocrine metaplasia, cyst formation and stromal fibrosis  Biopsy site changes Colummar cell changes Lymph Nodes: LN - Number of lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma: 1 Number of lymph nodes examined: 1 The mass identified in the uoq at 1:00 is an intramammary lymph node, almost enrtirely replaced by metastaic carcinoma. The metastaic carcinoma measures 0.6 cm and is negative for wTl. Results of immunostains for calponin and p63 support the diagnosis.. A 2.5 mm focus of invasive mucinous carcinoma is also identified, with nuclear grade II/iII. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed tissue with the following results for INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA (bloCk 4-5) :) ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (6F11, 90% nuclear staining with strong intensity PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (1B2; HER2 (4B5, negative (no nuclear staining) Negative (0 / 1+) The invasive ductal carcinoma is negative for wr1.. The smaller focus of invasive ductal carcinoma has similar inmunoprofile. Positive membranous immunoreactivity for E-cadherin supports ductal. differentiation. MUCINOUS CARCINOMA (bloCk 4-19) : ESTROGEN RECEPTORS 95% nuclear staining with strong intensity PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR ( 95% nuclear staining with strong intensity HER2 ( Negative (0) The mucinous carcinoma is positive for wr1.. Comment: Controls are satisfactory. an FDA-approved rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (clone 4B5) directed PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu is against the internal domain of the c-erbb-2 oncoprotein (Her2) for inmunohistochemical detection of HeR2 protein overexpression in breast cancer tissue routinely processed for histologic evaluation. The HeR2 test results are reported in accordance with the Asco/cAp guideline recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer (J clin Oncol 2007;) 25(1) :118-145). The ER and PR rabbit monoclonal antibodies are also FDA approved. ** Continued on next page

In addition, partially abutting weli-healed biopsy site with a peripherally attached 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm, ovoid, firm, smooth to nodular bordered, white to indigo blue ink-tinged mass, located within the upper outer quadrant, at 2 o'clock, 5.5 cm from the nipple and 4.2 cm the deep margin (designated Biopsy site #2 and Mass #2). The remaining breast parenchyma consists of lobules of yellow adipose separated by bands of mild to moderately dense, focally nodular and cystic, white fibrous tissue.
