Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and 'fat overlying tumor' is a tan yellow fragment of fibrofatty tissue 14 x 4 x 3cm. Dissection reveals unremarkable adipose tissue.. Representatively submitted in A1-A3. B. LEFT KIDNEY TUMOR BASE ? CA. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's identification and 'left kidney tumor base? CA' is a tan pink soft tissue fragment 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1cm. A touch prep is taken. Toto FSB.. C. LEFT KIDNEY TUMOR Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and 'left kidney tumor' is an oriented 320g, 9 x 6.5 x 6cm partial nephrectomy specimen with attached peri-nephric adipose tissue 8 x 6 x 3cm. The capsule is tan pink, smooth, intact and inked black. The 8 x 6cm resection margin is inked green. The  most deep surgical resection margin is designated by the surgeon and inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the resection margin to reveal a 9 x 6 x 4.5cm yellow-red, partially necrotic mass, abutting the deep resection margin and the capsule. Gross photographs are taken. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. The peri-nephric adipose tissue is serially sectioned. The mass grossly appears to be confined to the kidney. Representatively submitted: C1-C2: deepest resection margin C3-C8: mass C9-C10: peri-nephric adipose tissue CLINICAL HISTORY: None Given PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left kidney tumor. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: FSB-TPB: Left kidney tumor base ? CA- Suspicious for oncocytic neoplasm. Dr. has review this case  and agrees with the diagnosis and interpretation.
