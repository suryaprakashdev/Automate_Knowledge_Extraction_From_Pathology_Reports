RIGHT BREAST AND AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODES, LUMPECTOMY WITH SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSIES (X2): - Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3.. - Tumor size: 3.8 cm in diameter. - Ductal carcinoma in situ (Dcis), high nuclear grade, solid type, yith. comedo necrosis and calcifications.. - Dcis is present in association with invasive carcinoma, at the periphery of the  main tumor mass, does not extend significantly beyond the atea of invasion, and comprises less than 10% ofltumor volume. - Lumpectomy margins are free of tumor. - Carcinoma is located 0.3 cm from deep margin, and is at least 0.5 cm from. all other margins. - Metastatic carcinoma identified in one of two sentinel Iymph nodes (the involved Iymph node is sentinel lymph node with count 414).. - The metastatic focus measures 1.2 cm in diameter; no extranodal extension. is identified.. - Metastatic carcinoma comprises approximately 40% of the inyolved Iymph node volume.

Sentinel iymph node;Right Breast : Clinical History/Operative Dx: .  Right breast mass/cancer Gross Descriptlon: A. Specimen is labeled right breast lumpectomy. initlly recelved in fresh state for possible tumor bank  studies is a 74 gram portion of yellow-tan fibrofally sof tissue, 4.5 cm anterior-posterior, 5.5 cm superior-inferior, 8.5 cm medlal-tateral. Three sets of sutures are present designated as,follows: a double Tong designated inferior, a single long designated medial, a double shont designated anterior. The  margins are now differentially inked. The specimen is senially sectioned perpendicularly through the  medlal-laterat long axis to reveal a partially well demarcated dense gray-tan tymor mass measuring. 0.6 cm of the superior, 0.8 cm of the anterior, 1.0 cm of the lateral and 1.2 cm of the infegior surgical.  margins. The cut surfaces surrounding the tumor mass are lobular, admixed yellow-tan yithout additional. discrete nodularty. Representative sections are submitted in a sequential fashion, lateral towards medial. Cassette summary:  A1-A2) slab 1, aleral margin Page 3 Printed: This repost continues...
