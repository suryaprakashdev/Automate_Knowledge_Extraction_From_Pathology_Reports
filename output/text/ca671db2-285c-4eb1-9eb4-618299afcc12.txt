(L) MAXILLARY SINUS MUcsOA- A 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.1 cm transparent mucosa with attached fragments of bone. No abnormalities are identified. The entire soft tissue submitted in L1 and the bony part is for submitted in L2 for decalcification.. (M) LEFT MAXILLA TOTAL PALATECTOMY IN A BLOCK INCISION THAT INCLUDES PART OF THE LEFT MAXILLA, HARD PALATE AND SOFT PALATE, which is 5.5 cm anterior to posterior, 4.3 cm lateral to lateral, and 2.8 cm superior to inferior. The attached soft tissue extends 4.0 cm beyond these one margins. The soft palate mucosa has a 2.0 cm ulcer with irregular edges and necrotic base. This corresponds to a tumor which invades the underlying soft tissue to a maximum depth of 1.0 cm. The adjacent mucosa overlying the hard palate is finely granular and has a verrucous architecture. It seems to be confined to the mucosa and submucosa. The soft tissue is sequentially submitted for grossing from the medial to the lateral aspect of the specimen.The bony parts are sent to the bone lab for decalcification. INK CODE: Black-posterior and medial, one resection margin SECTION CODE: M1-M2, the entire soft tissue including the tumor and adjacent lesion, progressing from he medial to the later; M22, he posterior bony resection margin CLINICAL HISTORY Squamous cell carcinoma, retromolar trigone and palate SNOMEDCODES Page 3 of 4 Surgical Pathology Report File under: Pathology
