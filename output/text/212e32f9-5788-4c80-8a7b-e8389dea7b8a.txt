Comment: There are two separate tumors in the right breast mastectomy. specimen. Since these tumors are separated by 4.5 cm and are located in different quadrants the designation "multicentric" is used. Both tumors. are histologically similar. The acellular marker material present in the specimen is associated with the upper middle tumor (tumor #2). There are isolated tumor cells present in a section adjacent to the upper middle.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA -  PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): tumor (tumor #2, slide B4), making the exact determination of tumor size difficult. The largest dimension measured of the tumor is 1.2 cm from the previous biopsy specimen (s08-. ,'', making the tumor stage Tlc. The histologic appearance along with the presence of lobular carcinoma in situ and the immunohistochemical characterization of the previous biopsy support the diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma. **  Report Electronically Signed Out * CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: year-old female with right breast mass birads four on mammogram, ultrasound guided biopsy, invasive lobular carcinoma. Bilateral simple mastectomy, skin biopsy, with immediate reconstruction. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFT BREAST TISSUE WITH MARKINGS" is a mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior, long stitch lateral, and double stitch "down".  The specimen measures 17.0 cm medial to lateral, 16 cm superior to inferior, and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior. The lightly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 10.0 x 3.0 cm and displays a 1.0 cm centrally located everted nipple free of discharge. No scar is identified. The deep margin is inked black. Serial sections reveal predominantly lobulated, yellow-tan, adipose tissue admixed with evenly distributed, tan-white, fibrous tissue comprising approximately 20% of the cut surface. On palpation, no discreet mass or lesion is identified. No lymph nodes are identified.. Cassette Summary: Al: Skin. A2: Upper outer quadrant. A3: Upper inner quadrant. A4: Lower inner quadrant. A5: Lower outer quadrant. A6: Central. A7: Nipple. A8: Upper outer quadrant. Page 3 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974

All: Lower outer quadrant. Matched sections of Al through A6 are submitted in. : for cbcp protocol. B. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "RIGHT BREAST TISSUE WITH MARKINGS" is a mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior, and a long stitch lateral. The specimen measures 7.0 cm superior to inferior, 17.0 cm medial to lateral,. and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior. The lightly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 10.0 x 3.0 cm and displays a 1.0 cm centrally located, everted nipple free of discharge. No scar is identified. The deep margin. is inked black, and the superficial surface is partially inked blue. Serial sections reveal a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm well defined, tan-white mass in the upper mid breast, abutting the blue inked superficial surface, and coming to within 4.0 cm of the deep margin. Also identified is a second, poorly defined mass in the lower outer quadrant measuring approximately 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The lower outer quadrant mass abuts the blue inked superficial surface, and is located 4.5 cm from the deep margin. The. masses are separated by a distance of approximately 4.5 cm.. The remainder of the specimen is predominantly composed of lobulated, yellow-tan, adipose tissue admixed with approximately 20% slightly dense, fibrous tissue.  No additional lesions are identified. No lymph nodes are. identified. Cassette Summary: Bl: Skin. B2: Lower outer quadrant mass. B3: Upper mid mass. B4: Adjacent normal (to B3). B5: Upper outer quadrant. B6: Lower outer quadrant.

FOR OFFICIAL USK ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued): reveals three possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm to 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. The lymph nodes are bisected, and submitted in cassettes C1 through c3.. D. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name,. D, designated "RIGHT SENTINEL NODe" is a tan-yellow, lobulated, irregularly shaped fragment of adipose tissue measuring 5.5 x 3.0 x 0.5 cm in diameter. Examination reveals three possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2.3 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm. Cassette Summary: D1-D2: First possible lymph node. D3: Second possible lymph node.. D4: Third possible lymph node.. E. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name, ,designated "RIGHT AXILLARy TISSUE, NON SENTIneL NoDE" is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm irregular portion of yellow-tan, soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a single, 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm lymph node. The cut surface is tan-white, suspicious for involvement by lesion. The lymph node is bisected, and submitted in cassette El. A matched section of El is submitted in - .or cBcp protocol. Time in formalin for specimen A: 79 hours. Time in formalin for specimen B: 81 hours..
