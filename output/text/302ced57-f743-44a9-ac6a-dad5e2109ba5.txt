TCGA-AL-3467 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Clinical History/Diagnosis: Left Renal Mass. Source of Specimen(s): Left Kidney Gross Description: Received in one part. Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled # 1, "left kidney'. Gross Description: Received fresh in a container with patient's name and medical record number labeled "left kidney". It consists of a 300 gram left radical nephrectomy measuring 12.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm. There is a moderate amount of perinephric fat measuring up to 2.0 cm from point of attachment. In the inferior pole there is a bosselated bulging tumor however the capsule is intact. There is no fat overlying the tumor. At the renal hilum there is a 4.0 cm segment of ureter measuring 0.5 cm in diameter. The ureter has a pinpoint lumen with no suspicious lesions or masses. The vascular pedicle is also grossly unremarkable. No adrenal gland or lymph nodes are identified. The kidney is bivalved revealing a tan, soft homogeneous tumor in the inferior pole corresponding to the aforementioned bulging palpable mass. The tumor measures 4.8 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm and grossly appears to invade into the inferior calyx [B]. Elsewhere the usual dark red kidney is present with no additional lesions or masses found. Representative sections are submitted in 1A-H. Fresh tissue is procured for Cytogenetics. Designation of Sections: 1A- ureter and vascular margins, 1B-1C- tumor in relationship to capsule, 1D-1E- tumor, 1F- tumor in relationship to adjacent parenchyma, 1G- fat/potential lymph nodes, 1H- uninvolved kidney ****************************************************** Final Diagnosis: Left kidney: 1 Papillary renal cell darcinoma. /The 4.8 cm-low-grade carcinoma is confined to renal parenchyma Angiolymphatic invasion is not identified.. - Surgical resection margins are free of tumor. pTNM: T1b Nx Mx Comment: Immunohistochemical studies reveal tumor cells positive for CK7

and negative for EMA. These results support the light microscopic impression. Procedures/Addenda FC Cytogenetics Solid Results-Comments CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS DIAGNOSIS: Left Renal Mass KARYOTYPE: Normal karyotype: 46,XX[21] RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after seven days in culture. The chromosomes from 21 metaphases were counted and analyzed, and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The modal chromosome number was 46, and the cells appeared to have a normal karyotype. These normal results may reflect an overgrowth of normal interstitial tissue rather than tumor.
