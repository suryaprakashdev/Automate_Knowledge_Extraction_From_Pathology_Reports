IcD-0-3 8140/3 adinvcurcinomn N1 s Site : cecum C18.0 p 3/29f1 Jample ID # Diagnosis: 1.: Tumor-free lipomatous atrophic lymph node. 2.: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins and under inclusion. of an ulcerated, malignant, solid tumor in the cecum, conforming to the type of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, with infiltration of the lamina muscularis propria and without regional lymph node metastases (G3, pT2 L0 V0 R0 pN0 0/27). Additional immunohistological investigations are being conducted due to the histological. peculiarities of the tumor. A follow-up report on this will be submitted at a later date. Follow-up report: From an immunohistological perspective, the tumor cells were positive for broad-. spectrum cytokeratins. Large numbers of CD3-positive and CD20-negative or T- lymphocytes are also interspersed. Based on the histology and immunohistology, this is thus a poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, or cecum carcinoma, with a dense lymphocytic stromal infiltrate. The poor tumor differentiation and the dense lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration may. be indicators of the presence of a microsatellite unstable (possibly HNPCC-associated) colorectal carcinoma.
