Findings were discussed with Specimens Received: A: Left modified radicalmastectomy; mastectomy B: Right simple mastectomy; partial mastectomy Gross Description: Received are two containers, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. Container A is further designated '1. Left modified radicalmastectomy; mastectomy.' The radiographic findings for this breast include an irreglarly shaped mass measuring 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.9 cm and areas of heterogenous kinetics with washout. The total extent of the abnormal enhancing is 2.8 x 2.3 x 1.9 cm. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 468 gram mastectomy specimen measuring 14.5 cm from medial to lateral, 17.5 cm from superior to inferior and 3.7 cm from anterior to posterior. It has an axillary tail measuring 11 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm. The skin measures 13.2 x 5 cm and an nipple areola complex measuring 3 x 2.7 cm and a nipple measuring 1 x 1 cm. The specimen is inked as follows:

--- Page 7 ---
 posterior black, anterior-superior yellow, anterior-inferior green. It is sliced into 11 slices to reveal a lesion that is present from slices 6 to 8 and the lesion measures 1.9 x 1.5 cm and has a medial to lateral dimension of 1.5 cm. It focally abuts the deep margin and is 3 cm from the inferior margin and 9 cm from the superior margin. No other lesions or masses are identified. A  number of lymph node candidates are identified in the axillary tail, the largest of which measures 2.5 x 2 x 1.8 cm. This large lymph node is sectioned to reveal a central area of necrosis.

Container B is further designated '2. Right simple mastectomy; partial mastectomy.' Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 350 gram mastectomy specimen measuring 17 cm from medial to lateral, 13.5 from superior to inferior, and 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior. There is a skin ellipse  measuring3 x 3.5 cm and an areola measuring 2.5 x 2.7 cm and a nipple measuring 1 x 1 cm. It is sliced into 14 slices in which there is a hematoma cavity measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 3.1 cm found in slices 3, 4, 5 and 6. The cavity has a rim of white-tan, firm tissue around it and the cavity is 1.1 cm from the deep margin and 0.6 cm from the inferior margin. Also note that the deep margin is. inked red, the anterior-superior margin is inked blue and the anterior-inferior. margin is inked green. No other lesions or masses are identified.
