Encounter Date: inflammation; multifocal clear cell changes. Pathologic Stage (pTNM) : pT1a NX MX By immunoperoxidase staining the tumor is positive for AmAcR and ck7 and negative for wT-1 and cD 57, supporting the above diagnosis. ANALYTE SPECIFIC REAGENT (ASR) DISCLAIMER This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the The U.s. Food and Drug Administration has not approved or cleared this test; however, FDA clearance or approval is not currently required for clinical use. (Electronic Signature) SPECIMEN SUBMITTED A: PARTIAL KIDNEY B: LEFT ADRENAL CLINICAL DATA LEFT RENAL MASS INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULT DIAGNOSIS A. Encapsulated neoplasm. Margin is grossly negative (gross diagnosis only). ( GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh at the frozen desk labeled "partial nephrectomy" is a segment of kidney measuring 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm and weighing 26.7 grams. Renal artery, vein, pelvic and ureter are not present in the specimen. A 3.5 x 3.2 x 3.0 cm tan soft encapsulated tumor mass is present within the specimen. The tumor bulges the renal capsule and extends to 0.1 cm from the capsular/soft tissue margin (inked blue). The mass is 0.1 cm from the parenchymal margin of resection (inked black). After gross inspection with the surgeon, a possible frozen section was canceled at the surgeon's request because the parenchymal margin was grossly negative for tumor. Sections are submitted as follows: Al tumor; A2 uninvolved kidney; A3 tumor with parenchymal and capsular/soft tissue margin; A4 tumor with parenchymal margin; A5-A6 tumor with capsular/soft tissue.. B. Received fresh labeled "left adrenal" is a specimen consisting of an adrenal gland measuring 8 x 4.5 x 1 cm and weighing 20.8 grams. No masses are palpated. The specimen is inked black and serially sectioned. Sectioning reveals unremarkable adrenal parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted in B1-B4.
