SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Material Submitted: !eft breast with axillary contents nicol 1cs-0-3 History: Carcioma, mifitnsting ductal, nos. Clinical 8500/3 Diagnosis: Sin: bresst Nos c5o.9 Operating 1/s/n pw Surgeon: Pathology Number Dr. Gross Examination:. The specimen is received in a single container, labeled with the patient's name, history. number, date and "left breast and axillary contents". Received is a breast measuring approximately 23.0 x 16.0 x 8.5 cm. Also received is axillary contents measuring 8.0 cm. x 9.0 cm.x 3.0 cm. There is no previous scars or other lesions on the surface of the breast. Noted grossly was a 5.0 x 5.0x 4.0 cm. mass submitted for receptors. The specimen has been inked in blue and sectioned extensively berore accessioning. Examination of the specimen reveals a firm white nodule measuring approximately 3.5 x 3.0 cm. in two dimensions. Gross inspection of the tumor at the deep margin does not show extension through the deep margin grossly. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Block I: representative section of tumor to show deep margin.. T~V Block II: representative section of tumor to show deep margin.. Bloeks III and IV: representative sections of the tumor.. Palpation of the remainder of the breast does not reveal any separate nodules from the. main tumor region. From the main mass, a couple of satellite nodules are noted that appear to be contiguous with the main mass. A section of this area is submitted in Block v.. Block VI: representative section of nipple. Block VII: representative section of skin over tumor. Block viII: random sample of upper inner quadrant. Block IX: random sample of lower inner quadrant.. Block X: random sample of upper outer quadrant.. Block XI: random sample of lower outer quadrant. The axillary contents are separate from the remainder of the specimen and palpated for. lymph nodes. Lymph node candidates are submitted from the inferior to the superior direction. They are submitted as follows: Block xII: two lymph node candidates. Block Xill: three Iymph node candidates.. Block Xiv: three Iymph node candidates. UUID: 2D3D759B-D06A-4FC6-85SA-SE9F83ADBED9 CGA-B6-A0I6-01A-PI Redacted Block Xv: five lymph node candldates. Block XVI: three lymph node candidates. Block xvi: three lymph node candidates.. Block XviII: five lymph node candidates.. (Continued on
