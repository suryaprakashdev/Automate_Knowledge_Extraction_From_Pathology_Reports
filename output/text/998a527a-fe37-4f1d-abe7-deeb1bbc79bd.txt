Surg Path Final Report * Final Report * Comment: This large, partially necrotic, diffusely infiltrating, high-grade transitional cell. carcinoma shows diffuse areas of squamous differentiation. The tumor extends to the inked. radial margin of excision. This case corresponds to a pathological AJCC stage of T3a,N0 Signature Line (Electronically signed by) Verified on: Gross Description (Verifled) "FSA." All frozen section control tissue is submitted in cassette "FsA,". "FSB." All frozen section control tissue is submitted in cassette "FsB,". "C, Additional apical tissue." The speclmen consists of 3 unoriented soft gray-pink fragments ranging in size from 1.6 x 1.6 x 0.7 cm to 2.4 x. 1 x 0.8 cm. Inked black. "C1-C2, fragments, representative. "D, Sladder." The specimen conslsts of an 11.8 x 9.5 x 8.6 cm bladder with attached fat. Attached is the prostate gland. Bilateral dista!  ureters have previously been submitted for frozen section. The specimen ls opened on the anterlor aspect and there is a 5.5 x 3.5 cm soft red-tan friable ulcerated mass on the posterior bladder wall which extends to the right aspect of the bladder. The mass grossly appears to. extend into the bladder musculature to a depth of 2.5 cm and grossly Iy appears to abut the radial margin. The radial margin has been inked black. The mass does not grossly appear to involve the left and right ureteral orifices. The remaining bladder mucosa is red-tan and. are grossly identified in the bladder. The attached prostate gland measures 4.2 x 4 x 1.8 cm. The posterior apex will be inked orange. The remaining prostate is inked black their junctlon with the prostate. The prostatic parenchyma is tan and no discrete yellow masses are grossly identified. "D1," distal urethral "D6," mass; "D7." teft bladder mucosa; "D8." bladder dome; "D9." right bladder mucosa; "D10," trigone; "D11," left seminal vesicle and vas deferens; "D12," right seminal vesicle and vas deferens; "D13," ieft anterior prostate; "D14," right anterior prostate; "D15," left posterior prostate; "D16,* right posterior prostate. "E, Left lymph node." The specimen consists of a 3.6 x 3.6 x 2 cm aggregate of yeliow lobulated tissue. On sectioning, 7 possible lymph nodes are identified. These range in size from 0.3 to 1.5 cm. "E1-E3," fragments, representative.. "F, Right lymph node." The specimen consists of a 4.4 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow iobulated tissue. On sectioning, 4 possible lymph. nodes are Identified. These range in size from 0.4 to 1.8 cm. "F1-F2." fragments, representative.. Printed by: Page 2 of 3 Printed on: (Continued)
