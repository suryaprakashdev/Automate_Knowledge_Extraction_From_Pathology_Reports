Samples have been made for cryo preservation .The specimen has been then included entirely. Microscopy The eyeball is occupied by a tumor proliferation morphologic features of which are those of a choroidal melanoma containing mostly fusiform cells (90%) and rarely epithelioid cells (10%). The lesion is loaded with melanin pigment. The mitotic index is low with 5 mitosis out of 10 high 400 magnification fields. The lesion infiltrates the internal third of the sclera, there is no extrascleral extension. The tumor proliferation infiltrates the intraocular emergence of the optic nerve but the optic foramen, the post laminar section, the cut end and the meningeal sheaths are free of tumor. The iris, the ciliary body and the anterior chamber are free of tumor. Conclusion Choroidal melanoma with mostly fusiform cells Size of the lesion: 10mm Low mitotic activity. The tumor proliferation infiltrates the intraocular emergence of the optic nerve but the optic foramen, the post laminar section, the cut end and the meningeal sheaths are free of tumor. The iris, the ciliary body and the anterior chamber are free of tumor. 123
