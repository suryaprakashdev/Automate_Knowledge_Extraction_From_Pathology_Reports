No treatment.. See diagram. Measurements: 14.10 x 13.73 x (6.55)mm. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A fresh, intact, left globe.. Dimensions: Axial 24mm, Horizontal 24mm, Vertical 23mm Cornea: Horizontal 12mm, Vertical 11.5mm Optic nerve: flush. On trans-illumination, a large shadow is seen inferiorly, approximately 15mm in maximum dimension.. Plane of section: vertical. Intraocular description:. On opening, a solitary pale dome shaped choroidal mass is seen, with possible ciliary body involvement. Tumour size: LBD 13mm. Height 9mm. MICROSCOPY Sections show a virtually amelanotic melanoma consisting predominantly of spindle cells however also including a minor epithelioid cell component . up to 10%. The tumour occupies basically the choroid with focal extension to pars plana. Most of tumour cells are arranged in a fascicular pattern with nuclear palisading. In addition, there is focal cytoplasmic vacuolation in tumour cells producing a balloon cell appearance. The number of mitosis is approximately 4/40 high power Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified:

Closed loops are not present in the planes of sections. The lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is minimal. Few scattered macrophages are present. Tumour necrosis is not seen. Bruch's membrane appears focally breached in one of the sections. There is no tumour extension through the sclera, optic nerve or vortex veins examined. Tumour cells are not seen at the resection margins. Elsewhere,  the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is shallow. The iris shows no significant abnormality but the ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of ciliary processes. The lens shows cataractuous changes. Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic. DIAGNOSIS Left eye, enucleation: Ciliochoroidal melanoma of mixed cell type. COMMENT Assessment of Hsp27 expression on immunohistochemistry will follow. In addition, molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the tumour cells will be performed using multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLpA). looking at chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8.~A supplementary report will follow in due course. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (MLPA) In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma'tissue was performed using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLpA). These investigations were performed in the The kit p027 from. which examines for gains or losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using : and the quality assessed using multiplex-pCR prior to the MLPA reaction. Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified:.

The MLpA reaction was run at least twice on. differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLpA products is. printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated: normal chromosome ip, disomy 3, borderline gains in chromosome 6 and normal chromosome 8. Taken together, these molecular data would place the patient in the low risk group with respect to the development of metastatic melanoma.  Consideration of clinical features of the tumour is, however, also required. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT - Tumour cells express Melan-A and Hsp 27 (score 2)..
