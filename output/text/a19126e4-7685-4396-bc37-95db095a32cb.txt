UUID:8C240699-846B-48A3-8436-53C0BCDD7AA3 TCGA-E1-A7YU-01A-PR Redacted Patient.  Surgical Pathology: Fina!,. Surg Path CLINICAL HISTORY: Anaplastic astrocytoma on outside slides. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Left temporal brain tumor" (Afl), in formalin. The specimen is a fragment of soft yellow-tan brain which is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in aggregate dimensions.  A portion of the tissue has been previously submitted as frozen. section AFl.  The frozen section remnant is submitted in Block Al. A small portion of tissue is retained in formalin and the remainder is submitted in Block A2 and A3. B. "Left temporal brain tumor", received fresh. The specimen is several fragments of pink and yellow-tan tissue which are 2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm in aggregate dimensions. A small portion is retained in formalin and the remainder is submitted in B1. INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: A. "Left temporal brain tumor": AFl- glioma. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: The specimen submitted as "left temporal brain tumor" consists of multiple portions of brain which is infiltrated by a neoplastic proliferation of malignant glial cells. Cytologically, the predominant pattern in this glial tumor is that of cells with round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei which exhibit a speckled chromatin pattern and punctate chromocenters lacking nucleoli. Mitotic activity is identified in these cells. In addition there is vascular proliferation and focal calcification in areas of tumor degeneration. Another small component of the tumor is characterized by nuclei with elongated spindle cells and hyperchromatic spindle shaped nuclei. Mitotic activity is also identified in this focus of the tumor. DIAGNOSIS: A-B. "LEFT TEMPORAL TUMOR": MIXED ANAPLASTIC OLIGODENDROGLIOMA-ASTROCYTOMA. SEE COMMENT. cOMmeNT: The predominant tumor component of this specimen is an oligodendroglioma and would be considered'a grade IIl oligodendroglioma in Verified by: Date Signed: 1D-03 ligoatrecyloru, cyacle.
