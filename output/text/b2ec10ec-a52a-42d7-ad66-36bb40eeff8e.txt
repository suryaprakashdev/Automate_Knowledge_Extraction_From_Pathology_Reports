Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "sentinel node #l, left. breast" is a 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm nodular fatty tissue biopsy. The fat is trimmed, and there is a previously bisected, disrupted 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm lymph node present. The node is sectioned perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted for sentinel lymph node protocol in cassette Al.. B.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "sentinel node #2, left breast" is a 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm nodular fatty lymph node. The fat is trimmed, and there are three small lymph nodes present which range up to 0.8 cm. The nodes are sectioned to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node protocol as labeled: B1 two lymph nodes with one lymph node bisected B2 largest lymph node serially sectioned perpendicular to the long axis  Received fresh for tissue banking labeled with the patient's name and "left simple. mastectomy" is a 481 gram, 17.0 x 16.0 x 4.5 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast is received with an overlying 9.5 x 3.0 cm black-brown skin ellipse. The ellipse has a central.. circular .3.0 cm areola which extends to the skin margin and a 1.0 cm central nipple.

RUN DATE: PAGE 3 RUN TIME: RUN USER: SPEC #: PATIENT: (Continued) GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued) breast is absent of an axillary tail and consistent with a simple mastectomy specimen. The deep fascial margin is smooth and will be inked blue. The breast is serially sectioned from medial to lateral to have an inferior, 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm circumscribed red-brown mass. The mass is more closely associated with the lower outer quadrant. This larger mass comes to within 0.5 cm of the nearest inked deep margin..  This mass is inferior and comes to within 5.0 cm of the inferior margin, is 13 cm from the superior aspect, is at least 6.5 cm from lateral and 7.5 cm from medial.  There is a clip identified and a separate tumor site which is centrally located between the upper and lower inner quadrant..  This smaller tumor is 2.3 cm from the nearest deep margin and is 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. The smaller tumor has a localization clip and is 11.0 cm from superior, is 6.5 cm from inferior, is approximately 4 cm from medial and at least 10 cm from lateral. The breast has diffuse dense white fibrous tissue with fibrocystic changes. The white fibrous tissue makes up between 60-75% of the parenchyma. Sections of tumor are sampled for tissue banking.. The specimen is sampled as labeled: C1 sections of nipple C2 areola at base of nipple. C3-C5 sections of large described brown septated mass sampled for tissue. banking in lower outer quadrant with cassette c3 being section of mass. nearest deep margin C6 deep margin overlying smaller mass with localization clip. C7, C8 smaller tumor entirely submitted C9 upper outer quadrant C10 lower outer quadrant (quadrant closest to large tumor mass). C11 upper inner quadrant (quadrant associated with smaller tumor with localization clip) C12 lower inner quadrant sampled INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION C, LEFT BREAST: TUMOR PROCESSED FOR TUMOR BANKING Image Image Image Signed (signature on file) *+ END OF REPORT **
