Addendum ** BREAST TUMOR IMMUNOHISTOLOGY RESULTS** HER-2/NEU IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY [NEGATIVE:0,1+; EQUIVOCAL: 2+; POSITIVE: 3+] RESULT  SCORE HER-2/NEU Equivocal 2+ NOTE (for 2+ cases): HER2 FISH is being performed and the results will be subsequently reported in an addendum. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: FISH (PCL) Interpretation nuc ish(D17Z1x2~3,ER882x2~6)[40] Interphase FISH analysis is equivocal for HER-2/NEU gene amplification.. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FiSH) analysis was performed on a fornalin-fixed Block 3A (left breast totat mastectomy) :siny the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene 1 An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were prese.nt and. evaluated by two independent observers. The ratio of HER-2/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere signais (D17Z1) was determined to be 1.93.  A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in the. equivocal range; therefore, this speclmen is eaulvocal for HER2/neu gene amplificatlon. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.25.The average number of signals for the chromosone 17 centromere was 2.20. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results.. This FISH test is performed using a modification of the Vysis FDA approved PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (1:2 LSi HER-2/neu I CEP17 probe : T-dennyb-2 buffer).This FiSH test was developed and its performance determined by the.  Pursuant to the requirements of CLiA '88, this laboratory has established and verified the test's accuracy and precision..
