Page 2 of 3 1. The specimen is received fresh, Iabeled "Right hemicolectomy" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon. "The terminal ileum measures 68 cm in length and 4 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 20.1 cm in length with a circumference of i1 cm at the diatal resected margin. The attached appendix measures 6.2 cm in length and averages 0.6 cm in diameter, and has aerosal adhesions. The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spang the length of the specimen measuring up to 7.0 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a polypoid and focally ulcerated tumor measuring 3.2 cm in length and 4.4 cm in width, 1.5 cm distal to the ileocecal valve, and 1.8. cm from the closeat radial margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades into the aubserosal fat. The depth of invasion is I.0 cm grossly. There is. also a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm polyp, 1.5 cm diatal to the tumor. The remaining colonic mucosa shows additional polyps, ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached adipose tissue and are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for pexmanent aections and for rps.
