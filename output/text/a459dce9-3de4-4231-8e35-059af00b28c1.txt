UUID:F18AFE4B-5333-418A-A6D0-E347ACA3C068 Requesting Doctor's Intormatlon: TCGA-OR-A5I-01A-PR Redacted Ccrcins mo., adceno! cortic 83/3 Site B Adveual Cland, cortex 074.D [80) 13 A SPECIMEN TYPE:  Adrenal T h CLINICAL NOTES: Right adrenal gland. Lap Rt adenalectomy -> incidentally found complex Rt 0 adrenal lesion. L MACROSCOPIC: 0 'Right adrenal gland'. The specimen corsists of an adrenal gland 70 x 45 x G 40mm weighing 26g with scanty attached fatty tissue up to 5mm wide. One surtace of the adrenal capsule is disrupted. On sectioning a yellow lobulated Y nodule 40 x 30 x 30mm with central cystic change and haemorrhage is present within the adrenal gland. The surrounding adrenal gland shows normal cortex and medulla. The nodule appears encapsulated by a fine capsule with no invasion into adjacent fat. Block 1: adjacent normal adrenal gland. Blocks 2 to 6: representative nodule. Blocks 6 to 11: MICROSCOPIC: A The 40 mm adrenal lesion is a low grade adrenal cortical carcinoma. It fulfils 3 of the Weiss criteria ot malignancy (predominantly eosinophilic cell type, N cytological atypia, diffuse architecture). The tumour is contined to the A adrenal and separated from the soft tissue margin but an intact psedocapsule indicating that local excision is complete. The mitotic rate is low (less than T 1 mitosis per 10 hpt). No atypical mitoses are identified. There is no. 0 coagulative necrosis. There is no vascular or sinusoidal invasion. Numerous eosinophilic cytoplasmic globules (a feature associated with malignancy) are M present. There is some myxoid change.. 1 Immunohistochemistry supports the diagnosis of carcinoma and confirms adrenal c cortical origin. It is as follows: IGF2: Diffusely strongly positive with parinuclear dot-like staining A Ki-67: Low proliterative index (4%) L Calretinin: Positive MelanA: Positive S-100: Negative P Chromogranin: Negative W iy> A SUMMARY: Right adrenal gland: Low grade adrenal cortical carcinoma 40 mm.
