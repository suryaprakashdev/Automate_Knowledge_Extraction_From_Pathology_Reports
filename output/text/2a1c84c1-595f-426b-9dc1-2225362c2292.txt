SLN #1 Received fresh is a tiny piece of lymphoid tissue within fibroadipose tissue, 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. A touch prep is performed; submitted entirely in cassette A1. B. SLN #2 Received fresh is a piece of lymphoid tissue within fibroadipose tissue, 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. A touch prep is performed; submitted entirely in cassette B1. C. LEft BREAST, STiTCh At AXIlLARy TAIL Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast, stitch in axillary tait" is an oriented 392g, 20 x 14.5 x 2 cm mastectomy with 11.5 x 5.2 skin ellipse and 1.6cm inverted and ulcerated nipple. Ink code: Anterior/superior-blue, anterior/inferior-orange, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned into 18 slices from medial to lateral with the nipple in slice 5 revealing a 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm white-tan firm well-circumscribed mass  beneath the nipple, present in slices 5 to 7 that is 1.2 cm from the deep margin. A gross diagnosis was conveyed to OR and tissue is procured. Representatively submitted: C1-C2: slice 5, mass and extension to nipple C3: slice 5, mass and deep margin C4: slice 6, superior posterior mass C5: slice 6, anterior inferior mass C6: slice 6, inferior posterior mass C7: slice 7, mass and normal appearing parenchyma.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer. ADDENDUM:  NOTE: A CD31 stain was performed on C4 and is negative showing no evidence of lymphvascular invasion. Special stains (GMS, AFB, PAS) were performed on the lymph node (C18) and are negative showing no evidence of funaal or acid fast organisms.
