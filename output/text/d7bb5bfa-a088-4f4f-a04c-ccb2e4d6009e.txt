Radical cystoprostatectomy. Specimen submitted: A. Right pelvic lymph node; B. Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles; C. Right pelvic lymph node; D. Left pelvic lymph node; E. Left distal ureter; F. Right distal ureter DIAGNOSIS: A. Pelvis, right, lymph nodes (excision): Nodular deposits of urothelial carcinoma in fibroadipose (lymph node replacement cannot be excluded). B. Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles (resection): Bladder: - High grade, papillary urothelial carcinoma with focal micropapillary pattern, 6.0 cm, involving entire bladder (all walls). - There is multifocal invasion of muscularis propria and focal extension into perivesical tissue. - Lymphatic (B4, B9) and venous (B8) invasion is identified. - Multifocal urothelial carcinoma in situ of bladder, extending into the distal ieft ureter and bladder neck. - Ulcers with foreign body giant cell reaction, consistent with previous biopsy sites. - Margins of resection, including urethral and ureteral, are negative for invasive carcinoma. - One Iymph node, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1). - TNM staging: pT3, N1, MX (See specimen C below.) Prostate: Benign prostatic hyperplasia with acute and chronic inflammation. Histologically unremarkable seminal vesicles. C. Pelvis, right, lymph nodes (excision):  Highgrade urothelial carcinoma with micropapillary pattern in fibroadipose tissue suggestive of  metastatic carcinoma replacement of lymph node. icD-o-3 pa' untneigl carcinoma. D. Pelvis, left, lymph nodes (excision): papiliary 8130]3 Ten lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/10). cqcf: urshlia1 car<inomg, E. Ureter, left, distal (excision):.

F. Ureter, right, distal (excision): Benign dilated ureter. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh, the specimen is labeled "right pelvic lymph node," and consists of a 3.5 x i.2 x 0.5 cm piece of fibromuscular tissue with two lymph nodes, both of which are entirely frozen. The remaining tissue is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: AFSC-lymph nodes; A1-remaining tissue. B. Received fresh, the specimen is labeled *bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles," and consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring 14.0 x 9.0 x 5.5 cm. The prostate measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm and the bladder measures 7.0 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm, the left seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x l.5 x 1.0 cm, the right vas deferens measures 5.0 x 0.5 cm and the left vas deferens measures 8.0 x 0.4 cm. The left ureter measures 2.0 x 0.9 cm and the right ureter measures 1.8 x 1.0 cm. Both ureters are shaved and submitted. The distal urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The right aspect of the prostate is inked green and the left aspect of the prostate is inked black. The anterior perivesical fat is inked green and the posterior perivesical fat is inked black. The bladder is opened anteriorly to reveal a fungating tumor measuring 6.0 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm located at the left dome, left lateral wall and anterior wall. No tumor grossly extends outside of the muscle. Additionally, there are multiple erythematous polypoid lesions on both right and left lateral and posterior walls measuring up to 1.2 cm. The prostate is serially sectioned and sections are labeled from A through H from apex to bladder neck. On cut section, the prostate shows multiple cystic and nodular areas and is otherwise unremarkable. The prostate is submitted in alternating sections and representative sections of the bladder including tumor are submitted. Summary of sections: B1-distal urethral margin; B2-right ureter margin; B3-left ureter margin; B4-right ureterovesical junction; B5-left ureterovesical junction; B6-trigone of bladder to prostatic urethra; B7-trigone to right wall; B8-left wall; B9-right wall; B10 and B1I-posterior wall; B12-dome; B13-right and posterior wall; B14-anterior wall; B15-deep to B14; B16-left wall; B17-section adjacent to B16; B18-anterior wall; B19-left wall; B20-anterior wall; B21-section deep to B20; B22-? tumor in fat near left wall; B23 and B24-additional perivesical fat; B25-RA apex; B26-RP apex; B27-LA apex; B28-LP apex; B29-ARA; B30-ARP; B31-ALA; B32-ALP mid; B33-ALP lateral; B34-CRA; B35-CRM; B36-CRP; B37-CLA; B38-CLM; B39-CLP; B40-ERA; B41-ERM; B42-ERP; B43-ELA; B44-ELM; B45-ELP; B46-GRA mid; B47-GRA Iat; B48-GRP mid; B49-GRP lat; B50-GLA; B51-GLP. C. Received fresh, the specimen is Iabeled "right pelvic lymph nodes," and consists of a 4.0 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm piece of fibromuscular tissue and possible lymph nodes. The specimen is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: C1 through C3-fibromuscular tissue which is firm, ser'a!ly sectioned and entirely submitted; C4-remaining tissue. D. Received . - t, the specimen is labeled "teft pelvic lymph nodes," and consists of a 3.8 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm aggregate of lymph nodes and fibrofatty I sue v - + is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: Di through D3. E. Received fresh,! I is labeled "left distal ureter," and consists of a 2.2 cm segment of ureter up to I.! cm in diameter. One end is clipped an. site end is taken as the true margin. Representative sections of the remaining ureter are submitted. Summary of sect. ons: t 1-true argin; E2-representative sections. F. Received fresh n -- :cimen is labeled "right distal ureter," and consists of a 5.3 cm segment of ureter measuring up to 0.7 cm in diameter. One d and the opposite end is taken to be the true margin.
