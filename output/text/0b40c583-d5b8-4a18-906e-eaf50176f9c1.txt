Gross Description:. Part 1 The specimen is inked and on cut section it reveals the kidney to be replaced almost entirely by mulipie nodules of tan-yellow. partialy cystic, hemorrhagic tumor occupying the whole kidney, measuring approximately 13.0 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm. Tho tumor grossly abuts the adrenal gland (6.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm). The tumor grossly appears to be confined to the renal capsule. The tumor surface show line papillary fronts. TPS is submitled. Photographs taken. Representative sections are submilled. add on: Summary of Sections: ATA -- Additional tumor with adrenal sections. The responsible clinician has been notified. 1ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON AIY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (ANDIOR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I RAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVEO THIS REPORT. Specia! Studies:. Result Special Stain Comment RECUT RECUT RECUT RECUT 1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section dlagnosis, labeled, "Left kidney". It consists of a 1190 grams.  nephrectomy specimen( 23.0 x 13.0 x 9.0 cm) with altached segment of ureter (1.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter), and seyment of renal vein (3.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diamete)r. The perirenal fat is minimal. The specimen is inked and on cut section it reveals the kidney to be replaced almost ontirely by multiple nodules of tan-yellow, partially cystic, hemorrhagic tumor occupying the whole kidney. measuring approximately 13.0 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm. The tumor grossly abuts the adrenal gland (6.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm). The tumor grossly appears to be confined to the renal capsule. The tumor surlace show fine papillary fronts.. TPS is submitted. Pholographs laken. Representalive sections are submitted.. Summary of Sectlons: F$C - frozen section control  UV - ureteral and vascular margin TC - tumor section with the capsule C - cystic areas of the tumor TRP - tunor with the adjacent renal parenchyma. ATA - Additlonal tumor with adrenal sections. 2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled, "Left tube and ovary" and consists a segment of fallopian tube with fimbriated end measuring 4.8 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter.  The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and unremarkable. The fallopian tube is serially cross-sectioned to reveal unremarkable cut surface with a 0.1 cm lumen. There are numerous paratubal cysts identified ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  The attached ovary is tan-white, smooth and firm. Cut surface is unremarkable and except for  numerous corpora albicantia. Representative sections are submitted for frozen and permanent sections. Summary of sections: Page 2 of 4

The specimen is received in fresh for frozen section consultation labeled, "Right tube and ovary" and consists a segment of fallopian tube with fimbriated end measuring 6.5 cm in length by a 0.4 cm in diameter.  The serosa is tan-pink and smooth with some minute paratubal cysts each measuring less than O.1 cm in diameter.
