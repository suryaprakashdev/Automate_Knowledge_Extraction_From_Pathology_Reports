SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Number of nodes examined:6 Note: This document represents an amended version of the surgical pathology report originally issued on That report is superseded by the present document.The amendment consists of the following change: Specimens Submitted: ORIGINAL REPORT: 1:KIDNEY AND PORTION OF ADRENAL,LEFT,NEPHRECTOMY AMENDEDREPORT: 1:KIDNEY AND PORTION OF ADRENAL,RIGHT,NEPHRECTOMY The responsible clinician has been notified. IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASEDUPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL).AND THAT IHAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh labeled "right kidney and portion of adrenal' and consists of a kidney with attached ureter,renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing240 g in total.The kidney measures 13 x 7 x 5.5 cm.The attached ureter measures 4.5 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 1.4 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable.An adrenal gland is not identified.The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a well defined tumor mass measuring 6.5 x 4 x 4 cm,located in the calluses and extend to the hilum. The biliary tract is not involved by the tumor.The tumor has a homogenous yellow tan rubbery to soft cut surface.A portion of unremarkable adherent gland is identified measuring 1.3 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.7 cm.No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric fat. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.Photos are taken. Summary of sections UVM--ureteral and vessel margins T-tumor THF--tumor with hilar fat TSF--tumor with sinus fat TK-- tumor with adjacent kidney RP--renal pelvis representative sections K-- representative sections kidney A-adrenal 2).The specimen is received in formalin,labeled Paracaval and pericaval lymph nodes" and consists of six pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 1 to 2.7 cm in greatest dimension.All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN-lymph nodes BLN--bisected lymph nodes Summary of Sections: Page 2of4
