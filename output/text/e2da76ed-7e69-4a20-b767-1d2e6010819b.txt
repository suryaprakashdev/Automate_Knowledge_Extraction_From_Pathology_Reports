FOR ORFICIAL USR ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): Case amended by to report results of HER2 analysis by immunohistochemistry (DAko Hercep Test): HER2/NEU PROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION: NEGATIVE (SCORE: 1+). Report Electronically Signed Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: -year-old female with palpable mass on right breast with no ultrasound or mammographic correlation. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGhr BReAsT BIopsy received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "RIGHT BREAsT ExcIsIONAL BIOPsy" is a lumpectomy specimen measuring 10.2 x 7.0 x 3.0 cm in dimension. The specimen is composed largely of yellow, lobulated, glistening adipose tissue admixed with white fibrous areas. The specimen will be inked and oriented as follows: Black-deep, yellow=anterior, blue-medial, green=lateral, and red denotes superficial and inferior. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior revealing a fiarly well-defined, grey/tan nodule, 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, abutting the anterior margin in the mid portion of the specimen. Immediately adjacent to this nodule is a 1.5 cm patch of indurated fibrous tissue involving the anterior and medial margins. The remaining tissue consists of an admixture of fibrous tissue (approximately 40%) and fat (approximately 60%). The fibrous tissue is variabiy indurated, particularly in' the inferior half of the specimen. Sections of. nodule and fibrous tissue are harvested for the cbcp protocol. Matching paraffin sections are as follows: Al: Nodule. A2: Indurated fibrous tissue adjacent to A1. A3: Fibrous tissue 3.0 cm inferior to nodule. A4: Fibrous tissue 6.0 cm inferior to nodule at the inferior margin. The remainder of the specimen is serially sectioned and submitted from superior to inferior as follows: A5-A12: Representative section from each level from superior to inferior.
