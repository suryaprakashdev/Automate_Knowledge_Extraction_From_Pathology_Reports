(Dr. Clinical History The patient is a. year-old woman with a history of biopsy-proven low-grade invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma( ') who undergoes left breast needle-localized lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node sampling. Gross Description The specimen is received fresh in five parts each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. It consists of one soft, pink-yellow, irregular, Part A is additionally labeled ' glistening, unoriented, fibroadipose tissue fragment that is 2.8 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section. The frozen remnant is entirely submitted in cassette A1. : It consists of one soft, pink-yellow. Part B is additionally labeled irregular, glistening, unoriented, fibroadipose tissue fragment that is 3 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm.A single large lymph node candidate is identified, bisected, and entirely submitted for intraoperative consuitation with the remnant submitted in cassette B1. The remaining adipose tissue is submitted in cassette B2. " It consists of a lumpectomy specimen measuring 5.4 Part C is additionally labeled ' cm from superior to inferior, 6.4 cm from medial to lateral and 2.6 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen has been oriented with a long black surgical indicating the lateral position and a short black surgical suture indicating the superior position. The specimen is coronally sectioned from medial to lateral into 13 slices to reveal diffusely white-yellow breast parenchyma with an apparent biopsy site cavity extending from slices 7 through 10 and measuring 2.6 cm from superior to inferior, 4.4 cm from medial to lateral and 2.4 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked as follows for microscopic evaluation of surgical margins: Anterior-superior black-yellow, anterior-inferior green and posterior black. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette C1: Slice 1 (medial margin), perpendicular. Cassette C2: Slice 3. Slice 4, inferior.. Cassette C3:  Page 2 of 8

Procedure/Addenda for AdDEndum. Date of Addendum.:. Addendum Comment An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed on block Al. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells.. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells.. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of O or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FIsH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory.. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HeR2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FiSH testing, and almost always show gene amplification. Page 4 of 8
