ADDENDA: Addendum HER-2/neU AMPLIFICATION ANALYSIS (FISH) AS PER THE REQUEST OF FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION'(FISH) WAS PERFORMED ON SURGICAL CANCER) USING THE VYSIS DNA PROBE FOR THE HER-2/neU GENE (BREAST CHROMOSOME 17 CENTRCMERE SIGNALS WAS DETERMINED TO BE 2.O5. A RATIO OF 2.0 OR GREATER IS CONSIDERED THE RATIO OF HER-2/neU SIGNALS TO AMPLIFTED; THEREFORE, THIS SPECIMEN IS AMPLIFIED. Addendum MATZRIAL SUBMITTED: BLOCK ~A2" FOR ER/PR AND HER-2/NEU (BREAST CANCER) FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS AND HER-2/NEU PERFORMED CN LEFT BREAST TISSUE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (0- 203; 1+ 303; 2+ 30%; 3+ 20t) HSCORE OF 150. sSTROGEN RECEPTOR I3 INTERPRETED AS POSITIVE PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (0- 10; 1+ 10t; 2+ 20t; 3+ 6Ot) HSCORE OF 230. PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR IS INTERPRETED AS POSITIVE HSCORE: <= 15 NEGATIVE > 15 <= 30 BORDERLINS > 30 POSITIVE HER-2/NEU - DAKO HERCEPTEST: A WEAK TO MODERATE COMPLETE MAMBRANE STAINING IS OBSERVED IN MORE THAN 1O% OF THE TUMOR CELLS. HER-2/NEU IS INTERPRETED AS WZAKLY POSITIVE (SCORE 2+). NOTE: Hor-2/Neu FIsH was ordered. The Her-2/neu and estrogen assays were performed with FDA approved methods. The progesterone receptor immunoperoxidase test used in this case has haan davalonad Any the performance characteristics determined by the Department of Pathology at  They have not bean cleared or approvod by the U.s. Food and Drug Administration. Hscore'is modified from: Estrogen Receptor Analysis, Arch Pathol Lab Med 1985; 109:716-721.
