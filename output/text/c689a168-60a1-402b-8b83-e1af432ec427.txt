Galibladder, excision (B): Chronic cholecystitis. Cholelithiasis. Tisaue next to right common bile duct, biopsy (C):. Benign fibroadipose tissue. Adrenal gland, right and intracaval thrombus, excision (D): Adrenocortical carcinoma, see note. Note: The right adrenal gland weighs 277 grams and measures 1o.5 cm in greatest dimension. The neoplasm demonstrates areas of necrosis with focal venous invasion present. There is The lesion does not appear to invade the capsule of the adrenal gland. The capsulax margins of oxcision appear free of malignancy.  There is thrombus present consisting of admixed. tumor and hemorrhage..  This thrombus correaponds to the clinically described:intracaval chrombus. The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive ior inhibin, calretinin, synaptophysin, and melan A; and non-immunoreactive for cD99. The immunohistochemical findings support the above diagnosis.. Gerota's faacia, biopsy (E): Benign fibroadipose tissue. Liver, biopsy (F): Hepatic parenchyma with mild macrovesicular steatosis

Histologic Type: Adrenocortical caroinoma. Margins: Capaular margins are negative, neoplasm involves. inferior vena cava. Treatment Effect: Not identified. Lymph-Vascular Invasion: Present, large and small vessel. Perineural Invasion: Not identified. PATHOLOGIC STAGE: Primary tumor: pT4.  Region lymph nodes: pNx. Distal metastasis: Not applicable.. Nore: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is transmitted to this Institution' s Cancer Registry as required for accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely upon the current tiasue specimen being evaluated and does not incorporate other relevant data. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining the clinical stage and should not be confused with nor substituted for it. The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon' s operativa xaport. Fximary Pathologist: Addendum The modified Neiss score of the neoplasm is 4.
