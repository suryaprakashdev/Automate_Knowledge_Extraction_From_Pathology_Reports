TcD-o-3 Corcnns, riral ce0l JID:5329DF1E-4818-4D68-8ED2-F9D136536300 Redacted Chrsmoprslie type 83/7/3 Sit OKiduy NoS Ce49 Surgical Pathology Report. XO 9/24/13 Diagnosis: A: Periaortic lymph nodes. - Four lymph nodes, negative for malignancy (0/4) - Prominent non-caseating granulomatous inflammation in one lymph node; special stains for microorganisms (AFB and GMS) are negative - See comment B: Left kidney. Histologic tumor type/subtype: renal cell carcinoma, eosinophilic variant of chromophobe carcinoma;. See comment Sarcomatoid features: None identified Histologic grade (if applicable): Fuhrman grade 3 of 4. Tumor size (greatest dimension): 7.0 cm Tumor focality: Multi-focal: largest tumor 7.0 cm, smaller microscopic tumor focus 0.2 cm in greatest dimension Extent of tumor invasion (if present specify if macroscopic or microscopic): Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: Negative for malignancy; see comment Gerota' s fascia: Negative for malignancy. Renal sinus: Negative for malignancy Major veins (renal vein or segmental branches, IVC): Negative for malignancy Ureter: Negative for malignancy Venous (large vessel): Absent Lymphatic (small vessel): Present. Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Gerota' s fascia (nephrectomy): Negative for malignancy Renal vein (nephrectomy): Negative for malignancy. Ureter (nephrectomy): Negative for malignancy Adrenal gland: Not sampled. Lymph nodes: Please see specimen A

Other significant findings: Angiomyolipoma (1.0 cm in greatest dimension) AJCC Staging: pT1b pN0 Comment: The findings in the lymph node (biock A1) are suspicious for sarcoidosis. Correlation with clinical and laboratory finding is recommended. Specimen B is a challenging diagnosis. Microscopic examination demonstrates a neoplasm consisting of tumor cells with occasional bizarre nuclei surrounded by extensive amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Neither mitoses nor necrosis are identified, but Fuhrman grade 3 nuclei are seen. The capsule is compressed by tumor, but definitive capsular invasion is not identified. Immunohistochemical stains are performed and demonstrate the tumor is positive for E-Cadherin and cD117 with focal positivity for EMA and CD10 while being negative for vimentin, renal cell carcinoma and CK7. These immunohistochemical findings are not entirely definitive, but, when combined with the histologic features, are most consistent with the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe carcinoma. Dr. has reviewed specimen B on this case and concurs with the above diagnosis. Clinical History:. year-old female with renal mass. Gross Description: The specimen is received in two parts labeled A and B. Specimen A is received in formalin and labeled with the patient' s name and "periaortic lymph nodes." The specimen consists of multiple irregularly shaped fragments of yellow/brown rubbery soft tissues that have an aggregate measurement of 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. Embedded within the soft tissue are four semi-ovai shaped tan lymph node candidates that range in size from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm up to 1.8 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm in greatest dimensions. The cut surface of the largest lymph node candidate is yellow/gray and without gross necrosis. Block Summary: A1 Large individual bisected lymph node candidate, entirely submitted. A2 Three individual lymph node candidates, entirely submitted. Specimen B is received in formalin and labeled with the patient' s name and "left kidney." The specimen has been previously triaged, and consists of a bisected kidney measuring 14.0 x 7.5 x 5.5 cm and weighing 280 grams. The left adrenal gland is surgically absent. Specimen orientation is not provided. The renal capsule is intact. A large, bosselated, tan-brown subcapsular mass (5.0 x 4.0 cm in greatest. dimensions) is present involving the upper pole; the capsule surface overlying the mass is inked black prior to sectioning. After sections are taken from the anterior and posterior inked capsule surface, the capsule is removed and strips with ease. The inferior pole cortical surface is tan/brown and there is. slight retention of fetal lobulation. Upon further examination of the cut tumor surface, the entire upper pole is replaced by a fairly weil-circumscribed, tan/brown mass that measures 7.0 x 6.0 x 4.5 cm in

greatest dimensions; several small cystic areas containing dark red fluid are noted along one periphery of the tumor that range in size from a few millimeters up to 0.5 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimensions. The  tumor obliterates the entire upper pole collecting system and extends inferiorly to the interface of the pelvicaliceal junction, and is situated within 7.5 cm of the ureteral surgical margin of resection. The grossly uninvolved pelvis is narrowed and the mucosal surface is gray-white, smooth and glistening.. Calculi are not present. The corticomedullary junction of the inferior pole is well-defined; the cortex measures O.8 cm in thickness. The inferior pole pyramids are gray-white with prominent medullary rays; a few papillae have pale yellow discoloration. Additionally, situated 4.5 cm from the previously. described tumor mass along the inferior pole anterior cortical surface is a well circumscribed, pale yellow nodule that measures 1.0 x 1.0 cm in greatest dimensions; the cut surface of the nodule is soft to firm, homogeneous pale yellow, and extends into the parenchyma for a distance of 1.5 cm. The attached segment of ureter measures 2.7 cm in length and 0.9 cm in circumference; the mucosa is velvety, pale gray and the lumen is widely patent. Separately submitted in the same container is a portion of pale yellow adipose tissue that measures 28.0 x 20.0 x 4.5 cm in greatest dimensions. The cut surface is homogeneous pale yellow and grossly. unremarkable. Also submitted in the same container is a single white tissue cassette containing discoid shaped  segments of the hilar vasculature and ureteral surgical margins of resection that appear grossly unremarkable.
