INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: TPA: Sentinel lymph node #1, biopsy: Positive for carcinoma Gross exam B: Left breast, mastectomy: Multiple tumors identified; closest is 1.5 cm from inferior/anterior aspect By Dr called to Dr at GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh is a tan-pink fragment of fibrofatty tissue (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm). Dissection reveals a firm presumptive lymph node (1.4 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm). The specimen is serially sectioned and touch preps are taken. Submitted in toto in A1 B. LEFT BREAST Received fresh labeled "left breast" is a 1,184-gram simple mastectomy specimen (27.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm) with a stitch on the axillary tail. The specimen is partially surfaced with a tan-pink ellipse of skin (15.0 x 10.5 cm) with a 1 cm centrally located, partially flattened nipple and 3.5 cm areola rim. The skin surface is remarkable for a grey-white,  well-healed scar in the upper outer quadrant measuring 1 cm that is 8.0 cm from the nipple. The specimen is inked and serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 14 slices; slice 1 being most medial, slice 14 being most lateral. The  nipple is located in slice 8. The cut surface reveals a grey-white, firm, stellate mass (6.0 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm) located in the upper central and upper outer quadrants and present in slices 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. This mass measures 1.5 cm from all margins. A second lesion is located in the 7 o'clock position (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) in slice 6. Lesion #2 is Iocated 0.6 cm from lesion #1, and measures 1.5 cm from the closest inferior margin. An ill-defined nodular area (lesion 3) is located 4.5 cm superior to lesion #2 in slice 6 and more than 2.0 cm from the deep margin. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Gross examination did not reveal distinct 12:00 and 10:00 lesions as designated on the request form. Lesions 2 and 3 may correspond to the 10:00 lesions as they did appear grossly separate from the main tumor mass, although very close. The main mass appeared confluent grossly and may encompass the 12:00 lesion. The remaining cut surfaces reveal predominantly yellow lobulated adipose tissue interspersed with grey-white fibrous tissue.

B2: Base of nipple, slice 8 B3: Nodular area above lesion #2, slice 6 B4: Lesion #2, slice 6 B5: Inferior margin, slice 6 B6: Deep margin, slice 6 B7: Superior margin, slice 7  B8-B11: Lesion #1 submitted from superior to inferior, slice 7 812: Inferior margin, slice 7 B13: Deep margin, slice 7 B14-B16: Lesion #1 submitted from superior to inferior, slice 8 B17: Inferior margin, slice 8 B18: Deep margin, slice 8 B19-B21: Lesion #1 from superior to inferior, slice 9.

UPPER OUTER QUADRANT LEFT BREAST Received is an unoriented tan-pink fragment of fibrofatty tissue weighing 37 grams and measuring (7.0 x 6.0 x 2.0 cm). The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal predominantly yellow lobulated adipose tissue interspersed with grey-white fibrous tissue. No lesion is grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes C1-C4.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2.

Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2, HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit), ;. Control Slides Examined: External kit-slides. provided by manufacturer (cell lines witl. nign, low ana neyauve HER2 protein expression), and in-house known. HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive. carcinoma identified for HER2 evaluation.. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern  Negative (0)/Absence of Staining Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Equivoca! (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for ' ; (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and

adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department.. HER2 TEST VALIDATION This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported results.. These cases were also blindly read using two different FiSH assay as amplified or non-amnlified and the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance  and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The Iaboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE 1.

CLINICAL HISTORY: A  year-old female with left multicentric disease, large 4.5 cm mass in upper outer quadrant 10 o'clock + IDC with 3 small masses; 12 o'clock + IDC 5 mm mass PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: None given ADDENDUM: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Resuits: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FiSH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed mild polysomy 17 with 2 to 3 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 5 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used 820 Source of case:. Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.65 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration:. manual count Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free and overall survival in stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu  gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the 1, under the direction
