SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Clinical Diagnosis & History: RLQ tenderness,  cT scan revealed mass at hepatic flexure at colon and mass lymphoplasmacytic infiltration at lamina propria. Carcinoma of hepatic flexure with liver mass. Specimens Submitted: 1: Lymph node, base of superior mesentery artery, excision 2: Lymph node, middle colic, excision. 3: Colon, right, hemi-colectomy DIAGNOSIS: 1. Lymph node, base of superior mesentery artery, excision -Metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in  one of two lymph nodes (1/2). 2. Lymph node, middle colic, excision. -One benign lymph node 0/1). 3. Colon, right, hemi-colectomy:. Tumor Type: Adenocarcinoma Histologic Grade: Moderately differentiated Tumor Location: Cecum Tumor Size: Length is 8 cm Width is 6 cm Maximal thickness is 1.8 cm. Tumor Budding: Extensive Increased Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes:. Absent Precursor Lesions: Not identified Deepest Tumor Invasion:. Subserosal adipose tissue and/or mesenteric fat Gross Tumor Perforation: ** Continued on next page **

Page 2 of 4 Not identified Lymphovascular Invasion: Identified Large Venous Invasion: Not Identified. Perineural Invasion: Identified Surgical Margins: Free of tumor Polyps/Mucosa Dysplasia (away from the carcinoma): Not Identified Non-Neoplastic Bowel: Unremarkable Appendix: Not identified.. Lymph Nodes: Number with metastasis: 12 Total number examined: 72 Tumor deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue: Identified Identified; number:1. Tumor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition): pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues) Lymph Node Stage (AJcc 7th Edition): N2b (Metastasis in seven or more regional lymph nodes) Note: Results of immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair. proteins are as follows:. MLHl: Staining present in tumor MSH2: Staining present in tumor MSH6: Staining present in tumor PMS2: Staining present in tumor Conclusion:Immunohistochemical staining for the tested DNA mismatch repair proteins is retained in the tumor. Some of the immunohistochemistry and Ish tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.. Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is. not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not. be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of (CLIA as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OFS THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. ** Continued on next page **

Page 3 of 4 *** Gross Description: 1. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "base of superior mesenteric artery lymph node" are two lymph nodes each measure 0.5. cm greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: FSc-frozen section control 2. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "middle colic lymph node" is a 1.0 cm lymph node. The lymph node is bisected and entirely. summit of the frozen section. Summary of sections: FSC-frozen s section control 3). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right hemi-colectomy" and. consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon. The terminal ileum measures 14 cm in length and 3 cm in circumference at the. proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 40 in length with a circumference of 6 cm at the distal resected margin. The appendix is not present. The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose  tissue measuring up to 5 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a circumferential mass lesion measuring 6 cm in length and 8 cm in width. The mass is located in the cecum,  23 cm from the proximal margin and 15 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the fat. The depth of invasion is 1.8 cm grossly. Right underneath the mass is a 4 x 2.5. x 2 cm conglomerate of five nodules with yellow/white cut surface (distance. from tumor surface to the deepest portion of the conglomerate is 4.8 cm).. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection.  The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the. specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for Tps.. Summary of sections: P- proximal margin shave distal margin shave T - tumor RS -representative sections LN - lymph nodes BLN - bisected lymph nodes C - conglomerate of 5 nodes, representative section ** Continued on next page **
