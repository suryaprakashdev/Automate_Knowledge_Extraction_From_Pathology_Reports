TCGA #: Sample ID #: Diagnosis: Resected section of colon (left hemicolon) with two colon carcinomas characterized histologically as colorectal adenocarcinoma of similarly moderate differentiation, one. located at a distance of 3.5 cm from the resection margin, with a diameter of 3.5 cm at the. widest point, and the other located 18 cm from the same resection margin, and measuring 3.3 cm at the widest point, one at the base of a tubulovillous adenoma with severe epithelial dysplasia (synonymous: profound intraepithelial neoplasia), and the other clearly at the base of a tubular adenoma with severe epithelial dysplasia (synonymous: profound intraepithelial neoplasia). Invasive spread of the tumor to the layers of the muscularis propria. Mucous membrane of the colon with a tubulovillous adenoma of the colon mucosa with severe epithelial dysplasia (synonym: profound intraepithelial neoplasia) and two tubular adenomas of the colon mucosa, with moderate epithelial dysplasia (synonym: mild. intraepithelial neoplasia)..
