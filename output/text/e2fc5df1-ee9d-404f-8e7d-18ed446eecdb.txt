Diagnosis/Diagnoses: Colonic resection specimen (rectosigmoid junction) including a tubular adenoma with focal severe dysplasia and transitions to adenocarcinoma in situ (synonym: high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia) with ulcerated, moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with incipient infiltration of the perimuscular fat tissue (G2 to 3, pT3) (cf. preliminary biopsy findings and with tumor-free oral and aboral margins. Follow-up report: Twenty-six lymph nodes of up to O.9 cm in size in the vicinity of the tumor were dissected out from the pericolic fatty tissue after clarification with acetone.
