It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved Iymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.

METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by 'ollowing the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen: Breast Core Needle Biopsy Block Number: Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL Intensity: 2+ % Tumor Staining: 10% Fish Ordered: Yes METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved HercepTest (TM) test kit . 'ssing rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in- house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The 7athology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. FISH/ISH ANALYSIS REPORT 3 Specimens Involved SpecimenS: B: RIGHT BREAST SUBAREOLAR CORE BIOPSY HER2/NEU RESULTS ANALYTICAL INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS INDETERMINATE (EQUIVOCAL) FOR HER-2 AMPLIFICATION Clinical interpretation of the results A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 to CEP17 signals and 4 to 5 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio of 2. A HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio of >2.2 is generally considered amplification, while a ratio of 1.8 to <2.2 is generally considered indeterminate.
