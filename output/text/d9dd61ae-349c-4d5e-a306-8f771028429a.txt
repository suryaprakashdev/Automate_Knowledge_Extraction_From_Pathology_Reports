D. Specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right breast mass (1 stitch superior, 2 stitches lateral, 3 stitches deep". The specimen consists of an 8.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm lumpectomy specimen, oriented with one stitch at superior, two stitches as lateral and three stitches as deep. The specimen is inked for evaluation of margins: Posterior black. Anterior yellow.  Superior blue Inferior green Lateral orange Medial red Serial sections are white-gray, ill-defined and frm. A mass is identified measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm; the mass is 1.0 cm from the superior margin, 2.0 cm from the inferior margin, 1.0 cm from the anterior margin, 3.0 cm from the lateral margin, 1.5 cm from the medial margin and 1.0 cm from the deep margin. The remainder of the specimen consists of yellow-white adipose tissue. No other lesions are identified. 90% of. the mass was submitted for microscopic examination.
