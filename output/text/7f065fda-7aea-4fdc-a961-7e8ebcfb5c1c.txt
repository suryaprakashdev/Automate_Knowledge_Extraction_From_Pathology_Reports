Gallbladder wali measures o.5 cm in maximum thicknass and is otherwise unremarkable. The mucosa is roughened, but yrossly unremarkable. The gallbladder contains some mucoid bile, but is otherwise unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in cassette Bl. C. One lymph node, 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. Bisected and submitted entirely tor r's. D. The specimen consists of a lenguh of stomach (4.5 x 6.0 cm in circunterence), small bowel (23.0 am in length and up to 6.5 cm in diameter), anci attached pancreas and peripancreatic tissue (4.0 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm). Both the bile duct and pancreatic duct are length of what appears to be a partial wall of a bloed yessel within pancreatic groove.. The cormon bile duct is patent to the aupulla.  The pancreatic duct is patent only to 2.5 cm distally before it is occluded. Upon sectioning of the pancreas, there is a poorly. defined fibrous white mass measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 3.0 cm. It conpletely surrounds the pancreatie duct and abuts the bile duct. Grossly abuts the black painted pancreatic groove and blue painted retroperitoneal margin. The remaining surrounding soft tissue is Jrossly unremarkable.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1. pancreatic resection margin D2. bile duct margin. D3.  tumor to black painted pancreatie margin and pancreatic duct D4. tunor to vessel in groove D5-6. tumor to pancreatic margin D7. tumr abuttirg bile duct and bile duct margin D8. tunor surrounding parcreatic tissue D9-10. tumor to blue painted tetroperitoneal margin D11. nomnal pancreas D12. one lymph node bisected D13. two lymph nodes D14. one lymph node bisected D15. three' lynph nodes Dl6. three lymph nodes IC/csh Frozen Section Diagnosis.
