GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Brain tumor (AFl-2)", received fresh. A 6.5 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm resection of brain tissue is received.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: A. "Brain tumor":AFl- gliosis, atypical cells.  AF2- glioblastoma MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Permanent sections reveal a highly cellular pleomorphic population of astrocytes consistent with a high grade glioma. The area interpreted as necrosis on frozen section as AF2 actually represents an area of hemorrhage as seen in permanent sections.. DIAGNOSIS: A. "BRAIN TUMOR": ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE III). SEE COMMENT.

No frank. necrosis is appreciable in any of the permanent sections, making this an anaplastic astrocytoma.
