TCGA-AL-3468 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Clinical History/Diagnosis: Renal Mass with Hx of CML. Source of Specimen(s): 1: Right 11th Rib 2: Right lower pole of kidney cyst 3: Right Peri-nephric fat. 4: Lower Pole Renal Mass-Right 5: Deep Margin-Right Renal Mass Gross Description:. Received in five parts. Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "right 11th rib". Gross Description: Received fresh with patient name and medical record. number labeled "right 11th rib" is a 3.5 x 1.0 cm tan fragment of rib having a minimal amount of attached soft tissue. A representative section. is submitted in one block, following decalcification. Designation of Sections: Block 1 Summary of Sections: undesignated-1 ********************* Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled # 2, "right lower pole of kidney cyst" Frozen Section Diagnosis: 2FS- CONSISTENT WITH BENIGN CYST PER Gross Description: Received fresh in a container with patient's name and medical record number labeled "right lower pole of kidney cyst". It. consists of a portion of tan fibromembranous tissue measuring 9.0 x 5.0 x. 0.2 cm with some attached associated adipose tissue measuring up to 0.2. cm. No markedly thickened areas or suspicious lesions are found. Representative sections are submitted for frozen section and the residue. is in 2FS. Additional representative sections are submitted in 2A *****************************************************k****************** Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, "right perinephric fat". Gross Description: Received fresh with patient name and medical record. number labeled "right perinephric fat" are 322 grams of yellow-tan. perinephric fat. The fragments are sectioned to reveal yellow-tan glistening lobulated cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted in three blocks..

Designation of Sections: 3A-3C Summary of Sections: multiple ***************************************************** Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled # 4, "lower pole renal mass-right" Frozen Section Diagnosis: 4FS- RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FAVOR PAPILLARY Gross Description: Received fresh in a container with patient's name and. medical record number labeled "lower pole renal mass- right". It consists of a 210 gram ovoid soft mass measuring 8.0 x 8.0 x 6.7 cm. There is some. associated fibroadipose tissue measuring up to 1.0 cm and the mass is predominantly covered with grayish-tan smooth capsule. At the margin, there is some normal appearing kidney parenchyma which is inked with black. Approximately 10% of the resection margin contains white. urothelium consistent with calyceal system. The specimen is sectioned disclosing a soft orangish-yellow to reddish-brown tumor. The tumor is approximately 0.2 cm from the nearest margin and does not grossly invade into capsule. One representative section from the tumor closest to the margin is submitted for frozen section and the residue is in 4FS. Representative tissue is procured for Cytogenetics. Representative sections are submitted in 4A-G.. Designation of Sections: 4A-4C- additional sections of tumor in relationship to parenchyma margin, 4D-4G- tumor in relationship to capsule. ************************************************************************ * Source of Tissue: 5. Labeled # 5, "deep margin- right renal mass'. Frozen Section Diagnosis: 5FS- NO TUMOR SEEN  Gross Description: Received fresh in a container with patient's name and medical record number labeled "deep margin- right renal mass". It consists of two fragments of brownish-tan tissue measuring 0.4 and 0.6 cm. respectively. Both fragments were submitted for frozen section. consultation and the residue is in 5FS.. Final Diagnosis: 1. Right 11th rib: Hypercellular trilinear marrow with left-shifted myeloid maturation consistent with history of chronic myelogenous leukemia.

2. Right lower pole of kidney cyst.. Benign cyst. 3. Right perinephric fat: Fibroadipose tissue; no tumor seen.. 4. Lower pole renal mass- right:  Renal cell carcinoma, papillary subtype.- The 8.0 cm carcinoma is confined. to renal parenchyma. - Angiolymphatic invasion is not identified.. - The deep margin is free of tumor.. 5. Deep margin- right renal mass:. No tumor seen. pTNM: T2 Nx Mx. Procedures/Addenda Addendum Diagnosis At the request of the primary clinician, additional information is. reported. The diagnoses are unchanged. The right lower pole renal cell carcinoma (part 4) is a type I papillary. carcinoma. FC Cytogenetics Solid Results-Comments CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS DIAGNOSIS: Renal Mass KARYOTYPE: Abnormal karyotype: 52,X,-Y,+3,+7,+7,+10,+12,+16,+17,+20,-21[20] RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after seven and eight days in culture. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and analyzed, and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The modal chromosome number was 52, and all of the cells had an abnormal karyotype. Abnormalities were.all numerical and included an extra copy each of chromosomes 3, 10, 12, 16, 17, and 20, two extra copies of. chromosome 7, and a missing chromosome 21. chromosome. Papillary renal adenomas and carcinomas have been reported to contain a unique

combination of autosomal trisomies along with loss of chromosome The constellation of trisomies includes chromosomes 7, 12, 16, 17, and 20, all of which are found in this patient' s karyotype. The literature suggests that tumors with tri- or tetrasomy 7 and 17 correspond to papillary adenomas and that tumors with more complex karyotypic changes are papillary carcinomas.
