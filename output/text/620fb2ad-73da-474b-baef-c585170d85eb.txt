Clinical Diagnosis & History ylo female with large right mass disease,for work up of abdominal pain.Imaging suggestive of renal vein tumor thrombus. Specimens Submitted: 1:SP:Kidney,right radical nephrectomy 2:SP:Lymph node,paracaval/retrocaval,excision 3:SP:Adrenal gland,right,adrenalectomy 4:SP:Lymph node,interaortic-caval/pre-aorticexcision 5:SP:Lymph node,para-aortic,excision DIAGNOSIS: SP:Kidney,right, radical nephrectomy Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma -Chromophobe type with marked epithelial anaplastic features Tumor Size: Greatest diameter is 12 cm. Local Invasion (for renal cortical types): Tumor extensively replaces the region of the renal sinus/hilum and focally invading the proximal ureteral wall Renal Vein Invasion Identified Multiple other small to medium size vessels in tne renalsinus also show invasion by tumor Surgical Margins: Free oftumor Non-Neoplastic Kidney Unremarkable Adrenal Gland: Not identified Lymph Nodes: Not identified Stagingfor renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma: pT3b Tumor grossly extends into the renal vein(s) or vena cava below the diaphragm 2.SP:Lymph node,paracaval/retrocaval,excision Lymph Nodes: Page 1of4

Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment RECUT RECUT RECUT MIB-1Ki-67 MIB-1Ki-67 IMM RECUT NEGCONT IMM RECUT NEGCONT Gross Description: 1).The specimen is received fresh, labeled right kidney" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 761g in total.The kidney measures 15 x 12 x 6 cm.The attached ureter measures 9 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter.The attached renal vein measures 1.2 cm in length and 1.5 cm in diameter. The vein is occluded by a soft tan mass.The renal ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identified.The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a 12.0x 11.5 x 5.0 cm multi lobular mass,obliterating the entire renal sinus,and abutting the capsule. The cut surface of the mass is tan yellow with area of hemorrhage and necrosis.Sections through the small remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma.The cortex measures 0.7 cm and the calyces appear invaded by the tumor.Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.
