RUN DATE: PAGE 2 RUN TIME: RUN USER: User: SPEC #: PATIENT: COMMENT(S) (Continued) LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION : Not identified PERINEURAL INVASION: Not identified PATHOLOGIC STAGING:S Primary tumor: pT3. Regional Iymph nodes: pN2b. Number of lymph nodes examined: 13. Number of lymph nodes involved: 7 Distance metastasis: Not applicable GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and "retroperitoneal node" is a 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm ovoid tan lymph node. On cross section, the node has a pale grayish-tan color and focally contains an area suspicious for a metastasis. A representative section is submitted in block A1 for frozen section. A cytologic touch prep. is prepared for Diff-Quik stain. The remainder of the tissue is submitted in block A2. B. Received fresh for tissue banking and labeled with the patient's name and "transverse colon". Received is a 12.5 cm segment of large bowel. The large bowel is recoived with a 22.0 x 12.0 x 1.7 cm portion of yellow. lobulated. omental adipose. The attached omentum makes the specimen consistent with transverse colon. The segment of bowel is received unoriented between proximal and distal. There is a focal area of serosal puckering with "creeping fat". The area is inked blue and the bowel is opened to have a centrally ulcerated. 4.5 x 4.0 cm tumor mass. The tumor mass is nearly circumferential and has raised. rolled borders. The tumor comes to within 5 cm of one margin and 2.5 cm of the opposite margin. The tumor diffusely involves the bowel wall and focally axtends through the bowel wall to superficially invade the underlying yellow adipose. The tumor focally appears to abut the inked serosa. There is 2.5 cm of yellow adipose between the tumor and. the mesenteric fat resection margin. The surrounding mucosa is unremarkable with normal. tan folds. The fat is sectioned and scant. possible lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are sampled as labeled: B1-B2 margins B3 porpendicular sections of nearest radial fat margin B4 representative sections of omental adipose. B5-B7 representative sections of tumor to include areas of deepest invasion and tumor to serosa. B8-B9 whole lymph nodes. B10 ons lymph node bisected MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The slides are examined and evaluated. ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **
