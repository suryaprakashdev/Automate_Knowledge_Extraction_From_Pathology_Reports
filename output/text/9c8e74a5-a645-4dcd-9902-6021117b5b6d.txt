Operative Procedure/Tissue Submitted: Transhiatal esophagectony, J-tube placement. Cervical esophageal margin free; non-stapled margin. Wants to know if there is malignancy. PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY: 1. #Non-stapled margin, cervical esophageal margin." Received fresh. in a smal! container is a 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm strip ot mucosa. The mucosa is tan-grey and stightly granular with submucosal hemorrhages. The non-stapled end is shaved. 1A. Shaved margin. Frozen section control.. 2. *Proximal stomach and esophagus." Received in formalin in a large container is a 17.5 cm long segment of esophagus with a 6.2 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm portion of proximal stomach. The adventitia and red and ragged with a defect noted 2 cm away from the proximal margin. A friable grey-tan tissue is extending from the defect. The esophagus is dilated to internal circumference of 13.3 cm that narrows at the. esophagogastric junction with an internal circumference of 2.8 cm. The mucosa of the esophagus is granular grey-white, thickened, somewhat rugated mucosa with areas of granular grey-white scaly tissue. It is remarkable for a 5.2 x 4.3 x 2.2 cm red-grey verrucoid tumors that is 0.1 cm away from the proximal margin. It is also located at the aforementioned perforation. The proximal margin is inked blue. Tumor .is extremely friable. The tumor has a maximum depth of 0.2 cm and extends to the adventitia within the area of the perforation. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified. They range up to 1.0 cm. 2A - 2c. Tumor to proximal margin. 2D and 2E. Tumor to deep and perforation. 2F - 2N. A strip from proximal to most distal with the proximal end inked blue. 20 - 2x. A second strip of esophagus from proximal esophagus to distal margin.. Proximal end is inked blue. 2Y. Granular scaly esophageal mucosa.. 2z. Possible lymph nodes. Photographs have been taken.. 3. "Cervical paraesophageal lymph nodes." Received in formalin in a small container is a 1.7 cm lymph node. Bisected. 4. "Cervical lymph node." Received in formalin in a smatl container is a 0.4 cm portion of yellow soft tissue. 5. "Gastrosplenic lymph node." Receivea in formalin in a small container is a 0.6 cm portion of arey-yellow soft tissue.
