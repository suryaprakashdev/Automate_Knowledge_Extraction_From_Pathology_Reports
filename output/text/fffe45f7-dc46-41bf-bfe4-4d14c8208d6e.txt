Part 2: Capsule Overlying tumOr, eXcisiOn -- A.  BENIGN FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE WITH CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.E B. no tumor seen. Part 3: Left kidney tumor, partial nephrctomy --  PAPILLAry RENAL CeLl CARCiNOmA, Type 1, MAXImAl fUHRmAn nUCLEAR GrADe 3 anD PREdOMINAIT A. NUCLEAR GRADE 2 OUT OF 4 (See comment). B. TUmOR IS LimITeD TO ThE KiDney AnD MEASURES 2.2 x 1.9 x 0.8 CM. C. TumOR IS fOcally PRESeNt AT inKED SURFACE; fOR FinAl MArGIn STaTUS, SEE PARtS 1, 2 & 4. D.  NO VascuLAr InvasioN is iDenTiFIeD. E. TNM PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pT1a Nx Mx (See synoptic). Part 4: renal tumor, Deep margin, excision -- A.  benign renal parenchyma with patchy Chronic interstitial infLAmmation. B. - no tumor seen. COMMENT: Part 3: Immunohistochemlstry shows tumor diffusely and strongly positive for CK7 and racemase (P504S). Tumor gt t ? focal positivity for CD1o. This immunohistochemical profile is consistent with a papillary renal cell carcinoma.
