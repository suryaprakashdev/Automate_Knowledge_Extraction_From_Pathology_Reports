ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than. or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours..  Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100)

Interpretation of the ER/PR immunonistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medicai literature. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. CLINICAL HISTORY: -year-old Caucasian female with palpable left breast mass. Ultrasound showed 2 masses at 12 o'clock position, Iargest one 2.0 cm. Core biopsy showed DCis, here for wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  None given ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen:  Surgical Excision Block Number: D9 Interpretation: NEGATIVE Intensity: 1+ % Tumor Staining: 8% Fish Ordered: No METHODOLOGY:  Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) using rabbit anti- human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from AScO and CAP  and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. Gross Dictation: Pathologist, Microscopic/Diagnostic Dictation: Pathologist.
