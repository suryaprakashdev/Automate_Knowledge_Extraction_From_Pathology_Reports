An irregular Intraocular multinodular mass with a base approximately 18.0 mm in greatest dirnension extends from t and comes to 5.0 mm from the optic nerve within the choroidal space. The mass is located between 2.0 and 6 o'clock. Tum harvested fresh per protocol. The tumor has a maximum height post harvest 4.0 mm and the tumor surface is binodular. A suggested from the external surface, the region of extraocular extension noted on the sclera covered by cornea is visible ad. to the tumor. The tumor flattens and becomes thickened again in kind of a rolling/ binodular pattern.
