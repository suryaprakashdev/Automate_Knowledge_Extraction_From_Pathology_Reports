UUID:FF947398-211F-4ED6-A157-B86B71988189 Patient Results TCGA-FF-A7CW-01A-PR Redacted Requested By: L HistopathologyReport Biopsy No: Final Received Date/Time Final Reporting Information Date/Time : Final Histopathologist :  Laboratory : Consultant-In-Charge Final Submitting Physician Final Histopathology Report Final DIAGNOSIS Cervical lymph node: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, non-germinal centre type (Hans' criteria). GROSS DESCRIPTION The specimen is received in formalin, labelled with patient's data and designated "cervical lymph node". It consists of several pieces of brownish tissue altogether measuring 2.5 x 2 x 0.6cm. (Al & A2; no reserve) MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Sections of lymph node show effacement of nodal architecture by a diffuse lymphomatous infiltrate featuring sheets of large cells with vesicular chromatin and prominent central nucleoli. There are frequent mitoses, apoptotic bodies and. clusters of macrophages, thereby imparting a starry sky appearance. Immunohistochemistry confirms the B-cell iineage of the lymphomatous population, being positive for CD20. They lack expression of germinal centre markers cD10. and bcl6 (<30s) with strong expression of Muml. There is no expression of cD30 thereby excluding plasmablastic lymphoma. cd2l fails to highlight any residual follicular dendritic meshwork and there is no overexpression of cyclin Dl, which rules against pleomorphic variant mantle cell lymphoma. There is strong expression of bcl2 whilst the proliferation fraction is high at about 70% by. Ki67 immunostaining.
