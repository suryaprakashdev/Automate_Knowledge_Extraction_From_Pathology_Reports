Case Clinical RIGHT RENAL MASS Gross Description A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "right perirenal fat" is an unoriented 11 x 7 x 2.9 cm piece of tan/yellow adipose tissue.  The cut surface has a uniform, fatty, glistening appearance that is unremarkable. No occult lesions or masses are grossly identified.. Representative sections are submitted in Al-A7.. B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "right renal mass" is a previously bivalved partial nephrectomy specimen which when reconstructed measures 4 x 3.5 x 3 cm. The resection margin has been inked.. Also, in the container is a stripped capsule that has been inked blue. This measures 4 x 4 x 0.2 cm thick that is lined with a tan, glistening,. unremarkable i tissue. The cut surface reveals a 4 cm nodular mass located 0.5 cm from the resection margin grossly.. The exposed parenchyma has a tan/brown smooth appearance. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1-B3= full thickness cross sections demonstrating mass to inked resection margin; B4-B5= mass to capsule; B6= representative sections of previously described fragment of capsule; B7= additional tumor without margin; B8= normal tissue.
