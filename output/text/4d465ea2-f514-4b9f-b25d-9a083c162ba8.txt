1c0-0-3 Cartnmu,1obulw,hifil+t^atNg 8520|3 e 50,9 Site Code:breast, Nos Final diagnosis Breast,/left/ wide local excision: Infiltrating mammary carcinoma with predominantly lobular features, solid variant, Nottingham grade III (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 3/3, mitoses 2/3; Nottingham score 8/9], forming a 2.5 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm mass [AJCC pT2]. Focal lobular carcinoma in situ is also present. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative fibrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes are present. All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.4 cm, anterior margin). (See comment.) Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel, excision: A single (of 3) left axillary sentinel lymph node is positive for isolated tumor cells [AJCC pN0(i+)(sn)], with multiple (5) isolated tumor cells/clusters, the largest measuring 0.05 mm. These isolated tumor cells/clusters are seen on sentinel lymph node #2 and by cytokeratin only staining. Blue dye is identified in left axillary sentinel lymph node No. 1. Blue dye is not identified in left axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 2 or No. 3. Comment: Immunohistochemical stain (e-cadherin) was performed on the paraffin embedded breast tissue and shows lack of cytoplasmic membrane staining supporting a lobular. immunophenotype. Faxitron done. UUID:D52A6E4B-C80A-4947-96FE-3295E418EC67 TCGA-AR-A1AT-01A-PR Redacted
