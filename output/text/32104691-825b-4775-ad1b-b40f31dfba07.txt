Side of specimen: left Size and weight of specimen: 1,250 grams; 33 x 19 x 10.5 cm overall Orientation: The external surface is inked green.  Presence/absence of adrenal gland: not present Tumor description/site: lower pole of the left kidney; The tumor obliterates the lower pole, greatly expands the capsule inferiorly, fills the pelvis inferiorly, and tracks through the renal parenchyma up to the superior pole. Tumor size: 16 x 7 x 7 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: The tumor is unicentric Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: confined; no areas of definite extracapsular extension seen Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: defer to histologic sections; grossly confined Gerota' s fascia: not involved (not present on the specimen) Renal vein: involved Ureter: grossly not involved Other organs: not applicable Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: negative Renal vein: defer to histologic sections Renal artery: defer to histologic sections Ureter: defer to histologic sections Description of kidney away from tumor: brown/tan, unremarkable renal parenchyma Lymph nodes (hilar): per block summary Other significant findings: none Tissue submitted for special investigations: yes; Tumor and normal to Tissue Procurement Digital photograph taken: no Block summary: A1 - ureter and vascular margins A2-A4 - tumor in renal sinus/hilar fat A5 - thick walled vessel/tubular structure in the perirenal fat A6 - renal vein involved by tumor with sections of renal artery grossly negative for tumor A7 - perirenal adipose tissue anteriorly, representative perpendicular margin (widely negative) A8-A9 - tumor at capsule A10-A13 - tumor abutting the capsule A14 - pericapsular adipose tissue and adjacent kidney A15 - tumor and adjacent renal parenchyma A16 - tumor and renal pelvis A17 - tumor and renal pelvis

A 18 - superior kidney pole involved by tumor. A19 - grossly uninvolved kidney. A20 - renal fat and capsule. Container B is additionally labeled "left hilar Iymph node." The container holds an aggregate of yellow/tan fibrofatty tissue loosely measuring 5 x 4 x 2 cm. Several significantly enlarged lymph node candidates with rough capsular surface are identified, the largest measuring 2.6 x 1.9 x 1.4 cm.. Block summary: B1-B4 - Iargest lymph node candidate, serially sectioned. B5,B6 - second largest lymph node candidate/several lymph nodes matted together, bisected. B7 - one lymph node candidate. B8 - one lymph node candidate B9 - one lymph node candidate, bisected. B10 - one lymph node candidate, bisected. Fatty tissue remains in the container.. Grossing Pathologist: Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed.
