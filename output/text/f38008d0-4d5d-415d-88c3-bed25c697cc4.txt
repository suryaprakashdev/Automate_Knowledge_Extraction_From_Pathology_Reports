Diagnosis: (I) shows colon mucous membrane with parallel crypts and associated mucosa and submucosa. (II) shows a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (colon carcinoma, G2) with penetration of all parietal layers (pT3), and lymph vessel invasion. There are also lymph node metastases of the carcinoma described (pN2). (III) shows free anastomosis rings. There was no evidence of any residual tumor in preparations I. and III., so that the resection margins were free in relation to this situation. Preliminary information is being compiled. Tumor classification: ICDO-DA-M 8140/3 G2 pT3, pN2, L1
