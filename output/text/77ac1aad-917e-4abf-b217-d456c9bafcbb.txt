Addendum Part #1: HER-2/NEU IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY [NEGATIVE:0,1+; EQUIVOCAL: 2+; POSITIVE: 3+] RESULT SCORE HER-2/NEU  Equivocal 2+ NOTE: HER2 FISH is being performed and the results will be subsequently reported. block, 4B5 antibody clone is used as part of FDA approved.  interpreted as follows: Score 0 (negative) = No staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of the and tumor cells. Score 1+ (negative) -- A faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10% of the tumor cells. The cells are only stained in part of their membrane. Score 2+ (equivocal) -- A weak to moderate complete membrane staining is  observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells. This score requires reflex testing by FISH. Score 3+ (positive) - A strong complete  membrane staining is observed in more than 30% of the tumor cells.. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: FISH Interpretation nuc ish(D17Z1x2~5,ERBB2x2-8)[40]  No amplification of the HER-2/NEU gene was seen by interphase FiSH analysis.. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FiSH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Biock 1H (ieft segmental mastectomy @ 2:00)  using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene  An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were.  present and evaluated by two independent observers. The ratic of HER-2/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere signals (D17z1) was determined to be 1.34. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified; therefore, thls specimen is not amplified. Athough amplification was not seen, many of the cells exhibitod 3 or more signals for both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy for chromosome 17. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 3.26. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.44. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results.. This FiSH test is performed using a modification of the.  FDA approved HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (1:2 LSI HER-2/neu / CEP17 probe : T-denhyb-2 buffer). This FiSH test was developed and its performance determined by the. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA '88, this laboratory has established and verified the test's. accuracy and precision. ual/Syn
