Dimensions: Axial 26mm; Horizontal 25mm; Vertical 26mm. Cornea: Horizontal 12mm; Vertical: 12mm. Optic nerve: Length 2mm; Diameter Smm. Pupil: Slightly eccentric towards inferior edge. On trans-illumination, a shadow is seen in the inferior pole measuring 19 x 20mm. Plane of section: Vertical. Intraocular description: On opening the eye, an amelanotic bilobated ciliochoroidal mass is present measuring 20mm at its larger base and 6.7mm in height. Tumour extends posteriorly to within 6mm of the optic disc. Tumour size LBD 20mm Height 6.7mm MICROSCOPY Sections show a non-pigmented ciliochoroidal melanoma associated with exudative retinal detachment. The tumour consists of a mixed cell population in which the epithelioid cell component amounts up to 80%. Tumour cells express Melan-A and Hsp 27 (score 2). The number of mitosis is high, approximately 16/40 high power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified:

The lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is minimal. Tumour necrosis is not seen. There is focal tumour extension into the sclera. Optic nerve and vortex veins examined show no evidence of tumour involvement. There is no convincing evidence of ring pattern of spread. Tumour cells are not seen at the resection margins. Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is deep. The iris appears uninvolved. The lens shows subcapsular degenerative changes. Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic and Bruch's membrane appears intact in the sections examined. DIAGNOSIS Right enucleation -  Ciliochoroidal melanoma of mixed cell type.

These investigations were performed in the The kit p027 from  which examines for gains or. losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used.. The DNA concentration was measured using  and the quality assessed using multiplex-pcR prior to the MLPA reaction. The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on assessment. The MLpA reaction was run at least twice on differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLpA products is. printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated: normal chromosome 1,. monosomy 3, normal chromosome 6p and gains of chromosome 8q.. These molecular data require correlation with the clinical and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT On request of the treating clinicians, BRAr testing of the primary tumour was performed. The sample was analysed for. BRAF vsong aene mutation using the BRAF RGQ PCR kit on a PCR cycler. The DNA was of sufficient quality: there was no v600E Reported: Pathologist:  Electronically Verified: 3 rimaly Tumor Site Discrepancy ua/Syn.w nse isc.rcle): QUALIELE iewed
