SPECIMENS: A. RIGHT COLON, TERMINAL ILEUM DIAGNOSIS: A. RIGHT COLON, TERMINAL ILEUM, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY: - INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON, WITH INVASION INTO SUBSEROSAL ADIPOSE TISSUE (4.2 X 3 X 0.7 CM). - ALL SURGICAL MARGINS OF EXCISION, NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASM. - SEPARATE TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA, ADJACENT TO THE APPENDICEAL ORIFICE. - APPENDIX WITH FIBROUS OBLITERATION OF THE DISTAL PORTION. - PORTION OF TERMINAL ILEUM WITH NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGICE CHANGES - SIXTEEN MESENTERIC LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/16). - SEE TEMPLATE. COLORECTAL CANCER TEMPLATE Specimen Type: Right hemicolectomy Tumor Site: Right (ascending) colon Tumor Configuration: Ulceration Tumor Size: 4.2 x 3 x 0.6 cm Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma Histologic Grade: G2: Moderately differentiated Extent of Invasion: Subserosa Margins: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (proximal. distal, radial) Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Absent Perineural Invasion: Absent Additional Pathologic Findings: Adenoma Extent of Resection: R0: Complete resection with grossly and. microscopically negative margins Lymph Nodes: Negative (0/16) Implants: Absent Pathologic Stage: pT3a N0 Mx SPECIMEN(S): A. RIGHT COLON, TERMINAL ILEUM CLINICAL HISTORY: Not given GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT COLON, TERMINAL ILEUM Received fresh for tissue procurement is a segment of terminal ileum with attached right colon. The terminal ileum is 4 cm in length and 4 cm in circumference and is grossly unremarkable. A segment of the right colon is 25 cm in length and 9.5 cm in maximum circumference. The serosal surface is tan- pink, smooth and grossly unremarkable. The attached appendix is 7 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter and shows unremarkable external and cut surfaces. The specimen is opened and shows a 4.2 x 3 x 0.6 cm tumor mass with central ulceration located at the mid portion of the right colon at 8 cm from the closest (distal margin) and 12.5 cm from the ileo-cecal valve. This lesion involves the portion of the colon which is not covered with serosa. It invades through the muscularis into the subserosa. A second polypoid lesion is identified in the area corresponding to the base of the appendix. This lesion measures 2.5 x 2.3 x 0.7 cm. Sectioning shows the lesion to be confined to the mucosa without definite evidence of invasion. The remainder of the colon shows an unremarkable tan pink mucosa. Throughout the pericolic adipose tissue, multiple presumptive lymph nodes are identified ranging between 0.3 and 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. All the lymph nodes and representative sections of the  specimen are submitted as follows:
