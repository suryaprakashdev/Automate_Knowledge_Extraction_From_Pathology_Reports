FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued) : D. BREAST, LEFT LOWER INNER QUADRANT, EXCISION: - BENIGN BREAST TISSUE; NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. Comment: There is no change in the original pathologic diagnosis. This amendment is issued to reflect a change in the HEr2 immunohistochemical status. The original report stated that the HEr2 was positive. based on the core biopsy material material has been recently amended to reflect that the Her2 is actually However, that core biopsy negative (further supported by confirmatory Fish study showing no amplification).  Report Electronically Signed Out CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: -year-old female with left breast cancer, and strong family history, desires prophylactic bilateral mastectomy.. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "RIGHT BREAST TISSUE, LONG = LATERAL, SHORT = SUPERIOR" is a 300 gram right mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior, and long stitch lateral.* The specimen measures 16.0 x 16.0 x 3.0 cm, and displays an 8.5 x 3.0 cm lightly pigmented skin ellipse on the superficial surface. The centrally located everted nipple measures 1.5 cm and is free of discharge. The deep margin is inked in black. Serial sections reveal markedly dense, pink-white, fibrous tissue involving 7o% of the cut surface. The tissue is slightly nodular, however, no discreet mass or lesion is identified. No lymph nodes are identified. sections are submitted as follows:  Representative Cassette Key:. Al: Skin. A2: Upper outer quadrant. A3: Lower outer quadrant. A4: Lower inner quadrant A5: Upper inner quadrant. A6: Central.. Matched sections of A1 through A6 are submitted in OcT for cBcp protocol.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued) : A7: Nipple. A8: Upper outer quadrant. A9: Lower outer quadrant. A10: Lower inner quadrant. All: Upper inner quadrant. 11C11 B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFT AXILLA SENTINEL NODE" is a single 1.8 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm pink-tan lymph node. The lymph node is trisected, and entirely submitted in cassettes B1 and B2. Matched section of B1 is submitted in ocr for Cbcp protol. c. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFT BREAST TISSUE, LONG LATERAL, SHORT SUPERIOR" is a 284 gram left mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior and long stitch lateral. The specimen measures 14.5 cm medial to lateral, 14.0 cm superior to inferior, and 2.5 cm anterior to posterior. The lightly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 7.0 x 3.2 cm and displays a centrally located, everted nipple measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The nipple is free of discharge.  The deep margin is inked in black, and. the superficial inferior half is inked in blue. Serial sections reveal a 1.9 x 1.6 x 1.6 cm well defined, pink-tan, gritty, indurated mass in the lower outer quadrant at the junction of the deep and superficial margins. The mass"is located 1.0 cm from the deep margin, and 0.4 cm from the superficial margin. The remainder of the specimen is composed of 70% of markedly dense, diffusely nodular fibrous tissue with scattered gray-blue cysts measuring up to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. No lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted: Cassette Summary: C1: Skin. C2: Nipple. c3: Mass, lower outer quadrant.. C4-c6: Deep and superficial margins of c3. c7: Mass with superficial margin. c8: Additional superficial margin. c9: Adjacent normal with cyst (lower outer quadrant). c10: Upper outer quadrant. cll: Upper inner quadrant. c12: Lower inner quadrant. Matched sections of c1-c3, c7, and c9-c12 are submitted in OcT for cBcp protocol. c13-c15: Additional representative sections of breast mass. 15cF: Page 3 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974

Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFT BREAST TISSUE LOWER INNER QUADRANT" are multiple fragments of yellow, lobular, adipose tissue. The first fragment measures 5.5 x 3.0 x 0.4 cm. The second fragment measures 5.0 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. Serial sectioning is remarkable for an area of focal hemorrhage measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm located 0.2 cm from the nearest inked margin. Representative section is submitted in cassette Dl. Also noted is a fibrotic band measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm abutting the closest inked margin. Two representative sections are submitted in cassette D2. The second specimen is inked in blue, and is serially sectioned to reveal. unremarkable, yellow, cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes D3-D4. 4CF Page 4 End of Report.
