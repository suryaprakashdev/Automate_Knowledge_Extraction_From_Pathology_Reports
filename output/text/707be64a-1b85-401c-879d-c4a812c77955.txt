The remainder o the renal cortex is tan/brown with a well-defined cortical medllary janction. The pelvccaliccal system exhibits smooth glistening tan wrokelium with no masscs cr lcsions identified.

Namely, the glomeruii show 5% focal global compartment. There is only mild vascular sclerosis and foca intimal hyal:nosi present MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The sample consists of kidney cortex and medulia. There are up c two hundred eighty-thrce glomcruli present in the sample submitted for light microscopy. Fourteen (14) glomcruli arc globally obsolcscent (53). The preserved glomeruli show very mild signs of hypertrophy, with subtie increass in cellularity and mesangial matrix. On PAs and Jones  siver methenamine stair, the glomerular basement mcmbranes appear of rormal thickness.No "spikes" or craters arc recognized. Tubules are well preserved; occascna active inflamnation. Less than St of the sample shows tubular atroply and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stains (AFog); these areas are mostly subcapsular in location. mild sclerosis ot the wall with subintimal hyalinosis..
