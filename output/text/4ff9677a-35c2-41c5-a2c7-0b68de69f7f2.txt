Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the. Resident/Fellow, [] MD Electronically Signed Out by [], M.D. Clinical History: The patient is a -year-old male with malignant neoplasm of bladder undergoing a radical cystectomy with Neo-bladder. Specimens Received: A: Right pelvic lymph nodes B: Left pelvic lymph node C: Left pelvic lymph nodes D: Bladder, prostate E: Right distal ureter, stitch on non-margin side Gross Description: The specimens are received in five containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "1. Right pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 7 x 6 x 2 cm aggregate of yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue. 10 lymph node candidates are identified ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2 x 1 x 1 cm. The lymph node candidates are submitted as follows: A1-A2: 3 lymph node candidate in each cassette A3: 2 lymph node candidates A4: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate A5-A6: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate B. The second container is additionally identified as, "2. Left pelvic lymph node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 12 gm, 5.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm pink-tan nodule consistent with lymph node. The lymph node candidate is serially. sectioned to reveal white-tan and firm focal with cystic and necrotic tissue.

The specimen is representatively submitted for frozen section diagnosis and read. as "one lymph node frozen, positive for carcinoma, approximately 2 cm" per Dr. {l. The frozen section remnant is submitted in blocks B1FS-B2FS. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1FS-B2FS: Frozen remnant B3: Section of lymph node. C. The third container is additionally identified as, "3. Left pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 7 x 5 x 2 cm aggregate of yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue. 18 lymph node candidates are identified ranging from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The lymph node candidates are submitted as follows: C1-C2: 4 lymph node candidates in each cassette C3-C4: 3 lymph node candidate in each cassette C5: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate. C6: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate C7-C8: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate C9-C10: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "4. Bladder, prostate". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 525.1 g, 16.5 x 11.5 x 5.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 9.0 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm bladder with attached pericystic adipose tissue and a 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm prostate. The right seminal vesicles measure 5.5 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm and right vas deferens measures 15.5 cm in length by 0.2-0.5 cm in diameter. The left seminal vesicles measures 4.5 x. 1.8 x 0.8 cm and left vas deferens measures 13.5 cm in length by 0.2-0.7 cm in diameter. The right ureteral stump measures 1.4 x 0.5 cm, the left measures 1.1 x 0.5 cm, and the urethral stump measures 1.4 x 0.7 cm, which demonstrate intact, patent lumens. The right half of the prostate is inked blue, the left half is inked black, and. the reminder of outer surface of the specimen is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened along the posterior aspect due to the location of the bladder tumor. The prostate is surrounded by thin, shaggy membranous tissue and sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, and spongy with no discrete masses and indurations. The opened bladder reveals a 9.0 x 6.5 x 3.0 cm fungating, shaggy, gray-tan firm to friable mass occupying the entire anterior and lateral walls of the right and left sides. Approximately 30% of the posterior wall is also involved. On cut section, the mass is diffusely solid and white-tan with focal yellow-tan areas consistent with necrosis. The mass extends through the muscularis propria and focally abuts the deep margin with a maximal wall thickness of 3.0 cm, and located 3.5 cm from the urethral margin. The remaining surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled, white-tan with a uniform

1.1 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe patent.. The pericystic adipose tissue is dissected for lymph node candidates. No lymph nodes are identified.. Also received is a detached vessel 5.0 cm in length by 0.2-0.3 cm in diameter. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1: Right ureter resection margin. D2: Left ureter resection margin. D3: Distal urethral margin D4-D5: Apical prostatic margin, perpendicularly sectioned D6-D7: Bladder mass, including deep margin (tandem sections) D8: Bladder mass and uninvolved mucosa, anterior wall. D9: Bladder mass and uninvolved mucosa, dome D10-D11:Additional bladder mass D12: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, dome. D13: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, posterior wall D14: Uninvolved trigone D15: Representative prostate through verumontanum D16: Representative prostate above verumontanum D17: Bilateral seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, "5. Right distal ureter, stitch on non-margin site". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter tubal structure consistent with ureter. A stitch is designating non-margin side, and opposite side is inked blue. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a 0.3 cm lumen and a wall thickness 0.2 cm. The outer surface of the specimen is pink-tan to yellow-tan, and shaggy. The inner surface is gray-tan and smooth. The marginal side is submitted en face as E1. xxx [] Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis: B1FS-B2FS: "one lymph node frozen, positive for carcinoma, approximately 2 cm" per Dr. []
