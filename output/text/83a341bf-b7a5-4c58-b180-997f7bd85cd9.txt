UUID:5A8CDA1B-CD49-4177-9716-FD42DE663E29 TCGA-Lk-A406-01A-PR Redacted FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Summary Statement This extrapleural pneumonectomy specimen shows a blphasic mesothelioma diffusely nvoiving:the visceral and parietel pleural. The histoiogy Is predominantly epithelioid, with a mlnor spindle cell componant. The tumor invades.the.  diaphragm (non-transmural) and pericardlal fat isolated tumor nodules within the lung paronchyma, together with the.  angiolymphatic Invasion sean in the lung, are bast interpreted as matastatic disease: Almost all $submitted lymph nodes are invoived by tumor. Pertinent negatives include the absence of pleural plaques, ferruglnous/asbestos bodles. [pT3N1M1 AJCC 7t" Ed.J part 1: Lung, Left Lower lobe, wedge resection -.

Tumor cells are negaive for TAG72, MOC31, monoclonal CEA, PAx-8, Inhibin, and TTF-1. Mugin stains(mucicarmine, PAs0) are.negative. Immunoreactivity for BerEp4 and CD15 is less extensive than that for the othar mosotheiial markers. The mesothelial markere hlghlight predominantly the epithelloid component, while the spindle cell compgnent ruostyl stains with cytokeratin antibodies.
