Margins: Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: 2 cm: mucosal margin opposite tattooed margin Proximal: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Distal: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. Circumferential: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Treatment Effect: No prior treatment. Not identified Lymph-Vascular Invasion: Perineural Invasion: Not identified Tumor Deposits: Present Pathologic Staging: Primary Tumor: pT3 Regional Lymph Nodes: pNO. Number examined: 10 Number involved: 0 Distant Metastasis: Not applicable. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and "liver biopsy" is. a 1 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm linear biopsy of tan tissue totally submitted in block A for frozen section evaluation. B.  Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "splenic flexure colon lesion" with tissue bank coordinator in attendance is a 12 cm segmental resection of large bowel which requests gross evaluation for margins. Both the measures 4 cm in diameter. surgical margins are stapled and not clinically designated. Tattoo pigment is noted which abuts one staple line. The adipose tissue is wrapped around the serosa in the mid portion.. Blue ink is applied to this area..  The tattoo stapled margin measures 5 cm in length and opposite margin measures 3.5 cm in length. The mesenteric margin measures 3 cm. Blue ink is applied to this margin. In trying to separate the mesentery from the bowel. it is found to be adherent to the bowel surface.". There is some fatty tissue present on the opposite The margins ars removed and the side which may be inclusive of some omental type tissue. lumen probed revealing an obstructing mass present. The tumor measures 6 cm in langth, it involves the entire circumference of the bowel wall. It lies 2.5 cm from the tattooed. margin and 2 cm from the opposite margin. A portion of the edge of the tumor and. non-neoplastic mucosa is provided to the tissue bank coordinator. The spacimen is pinned is out onto a corkboard for several hours of formalin fixation. The partial fixed specimen serially sectioned revealing that the tumor extends deep into the muscle wall. possibly. extending through the muscle wall. A subjacent lymph node is identified measuring 1 cm. The pericolic/mesenteric adipose tissue was placed in a 50/50 solution of lymph node revealing solution and formalin. On cross section, several lymph nodes are identified. which range from 0.4 to 1 cm in greatest dimension each. No omental nodules are identified.

In formalin labeled with the patient's name and "left lobe liver biopsy" is a 0.7 x 1 x 0.3 cm biopsy of liver tissue. There is a 0.5 x 0.4 cm pale area on the surface. The biopsy is trisected and entirely submitted in block c. In formalin labeled with the patient's name and "pelvic peritoneal nodule" is a 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm triangular shaped portion of gray fatty tissue. There is a 3 mm whitish nodule on the surface.  The specimen is bisected revealing this to be a partially calcified. hemorrhagic nodule possibly representing fat necrosis. The specimen is entirely submitted in block D.. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A&C. These biopsies of the left lobe of the liver show focal granulomatous inflammation with fibrosis. The granulomas are mostly noncaseating. composed of epithelioid. histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells and a sprinkling of small lymphocytes. These granulomas are set in a fibrous stroma. A few of the granulomas have scant central. necrosis but most are noncaseating. AFB and GMs stains are obtained on both biopsies. No organisms are seen. D. This is a piece of adipose tissue containing a sclerotic. partially calcified nodule compatible with fat necrosis. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. B.  Sections of the obstructing tumor demonstrate a moderately differentiated. adenocarcinoma which invades through the bowel wall. not quite reaching the subjacent mesenteric lymph node. Discontinuous invasion is noted. No metastasis are identified in 10 regional lymph nodes. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: A.
