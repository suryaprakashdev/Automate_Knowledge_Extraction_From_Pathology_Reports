SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT RECUT IMM RECUT NEG CONT Gross Description:  The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled, "Soft tissue bladder margin (fs)" and consists of a fragment of soft pink and yellow tissue (1.5x 0.6x 0.3 cm). The specimen is entirely frozen and submitted in one cassette. Summary of sections: FSC - frozen section control. 2). The specimen is received fresh labeled "Urachus, perivesicular tissue lymph nodes, upper portion of bladder, bladder diverticulum, distal right ureter" and consists of a portion of bladder, diverticulum, portion of ureter, and perivesicular tissue. The portion of bladder is received opened with a dusky purple-pink but otherwise unremarkable mucosa measuring 8.6 x 7.5 cm with underlying perivesicular tissue measuring 11.0 x 9.5 x 1.5 cm. The attached closed pouch like diverticulum measures 7.2 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm and is attached by a 1.8 x 0.5cm piece of the opened bladder mucosa.. The anterior wall of the diverticulum displays a 1.8 x 1.5 cm transmural defect of a possible urachus, the tissue surrounding the defect is inked orange, the remaining anterior aspect is inked black.. The posterior surface of both the diverticulum and bladder perivesicular tissue are inked blue.. The right aspect of the diverticulum has an adhered segment of ureter measuring 3.0 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter. The ureter has one clip and an opposing opened end. The diverticulum is opened to reveal a yellow-brown fungating papillary friable tumor measuring 4.7 x 4.3 x 1.5 cm, 4.1 cm from the transmural defect and 1.0 cm from the attached bladder mucosa..  There is a second adjacent raised papillary nodule measuring 2.5 x 2.2 x 0.9 cm, 0.2 cm from the fungating tumor, 2.0 cm from the transmural defects, and 5.6 cm from the attached bladder mucosa. Upon sectioning the two tumor nodules join and there is papillary extension to a depth of 1.8cm. The remaining bladder diverticulum mucosa is yellow and smooth..  The tumor is 1.0 cm from the attached ureter and the ureter is grossly uninvolved with the tumor. Both of the ureter margins are shaved and submitted en face. Perpendicular sections of the bladder mucosa margins are submitted ner clock face with 12 o'clock arbitrarily designated in pathology by the diverticulum attachment site.. Gross photos are taken. is taken. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: BM3 - bladder margin 3 o'clock BM6- lateral margin 6 o'clock (opposite the diverticulum attachment site) BM9 - bladder margin 9 o'clock TB - diverticulum tumor to attached portion of bladder TN - diverticulum tumor to smaller nodule ND - smaller nodule to transmural defect TU - tumor to ureter. UC - ureter margin (clipped end) UO - ureter margin (opened end) DIV - additional representative sections of diverticulum BL - additional representative sections of bladder F - tumor to greatest depth of invasion 3.The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "right vas deferens," and consists of a segment of vas deferens that measures 3.1x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U - undesignated  Page 3 of 5
