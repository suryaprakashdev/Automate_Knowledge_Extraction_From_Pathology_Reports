UUID:8EBDD431-36DB-4197-B4BA-A6F212CAC1C1 TCgA-V4-A9E5-01A-PR Redacted Date of surgery :. Right eye enucleation Macroscopy The eye ball measures 23 by 23 by 23 mm with a posterior segment of optic nerve of 10 mm .At the section, the tumor measures 14 mm main line. Samples have been made for cryo preservation, cytogenetic studies and for the preclinical investigation laboratory. The specimen has been then included entirely Microscopy The tumor seen macroscopically corresponds to a choroidal melanoma entirely made of fusiform cells. Tumor cells are tangled in short bundles. Some of them contain melanin pigment. Nuclei of the tumor cells are fusiform, ovoid with sometimes marked anisocaryosis. The mitotic index is low with 4 mitosis out of 10 high 400 magnification fields. The tumor is developed close to the ciliary processes ( slide C) and infiltrates the very superficial internal layers of the sclera. The optic foramen, the optic nerve and its cut end are free of tumor. The meningeal sheaths as well as the anterior chamber are free. Conclusion Choroidal melanoma of the right eye Fusiform cell type predominant Size of the tumor: 14 mm Infiltration of the internal superficial layers of the sclera Optic nerve free of the tumor on all its length, including the posterior end Anterior chamber and meningeal sheaths free L00.3 CeanwnNoS S730/3 (RC)wriel Cb9.3
