Gross Description: The specimens are received in seven containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.. A. The first container is additionally identified as, 'sentinel lymph node #1'. Received fresh and placed in formalin the specimen consists of a 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm lymph node which is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette A1. B. The second container is additionally identified as, 'sentinel lymph node #2'. Received fresh and placed in formalin the specimen consists of a 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm lymph node which is bisected and is entirely submitted in cassettes B1. C. The third container is additionallyidentified as, 'sentinel lymph node #3'. Received fresh and placed in formalin the specimen consists of a 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm lymph node which is entirely submitted in cassette C1.. D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, 'non-sentinel lymph node'. Received fresh and placed in formalin the specimen consists of a 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm lymph node which is entirely submitted in cassette D1. E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, 'right wire guided lumpectomy'. Received fresh on a radiographic grid is a 102 gm lumpectomy specimen measuring 8 cm from medial to lateral, and 8 in cm from superior to inferior and 3 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is oriented with a short suture designating the superior pole and a long suture designating the

Iateral pole. There is a wire entering the antero-lateral aspect of the specimen through grid coordinate E5. Accompanying the specimen is an x-ray demonstrating a metallic clip located in grid coordinate E3. There is a circled mass in grid positions C3, C4, D3, D4, centered on the clip. The wire enters the specimen in grid coordinates E5 terminates in E3. 2 other areas of calcifications are circled in grid coordinates D6 (#2) and F4-F5 (#3). The margins are inked as follows: anterior - black; posterior - red; superior - blue; inferior - green; medial - yellow; Iateral - violet. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 8 slices. The area of calcifications noted in grid D6 begins in the slides #2 and extends Iaterally the tumor the main to mass and measures 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. is found in the slices #2 and 3 adjacent to the red and green ink. The main mass, which is irregular and firm, is present in slices #5 to #7 and measures 3.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm. It is present adjacent to red ink and is 1 cm from black ink, 3 cm from green ink, 1.5 cm away from blue ink. The area of calcification noted in grid F4 and F5 is present in the slices numbers 7 and activated ink measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 1 cm and is continuous with the main mass. The metallic clip is identified in slice 6. The wire enters the specimen in slice 5 and terminates in slice 5. The remainder of the breast parenchyma is white-yellow and lobulated with no additional masses or lesions

Entire mass including both calcified area was has a largest dimension of 5 cm. Specimen is submitted in toto.. Block summary: E1-E4: medial margin, slice 1 E5-E9: slice 2, area of calcification E10-E23: slice 3, area of calcification E24-E31: slice 4 E32-E44 ; slice 5 E45-E62: slice 6, clip in E49-E50 E63-E78: slice 7 E79-E86: lateral margin, slice 8 F. The sixth container is additionally identified as, 'right breast, new inferior lateral margin'. Received fresh on the radiographic grid is a 13.5 gm, 6.5 x 4 x 1.2 cm medial inferior lateral margin which is oriented as follows: - new outer lateral margin is marked with a long black stitch (violet) - new outer medial margin is designated with a short black stitch (yellow). - new outer anterior margin is designated with a short blue stitch (black) - new outer posterior margin is designated with a long blue stitch. (red) Inner cauterized margin is inked green. An area of calcification is noted on the accompanying x-ray in grid D4-D5-E5. Specimen is a serially sectioned from
