A:  The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin and labeled. gallbladder.  The specimen consists of a partly collapsed gallbladder measuring 9 cm from. fundus to resection margin by approximately 3 cm in transverse diameter.  The outer peritoneal surface is unremarkable. The lumen contains multiple faceted and mulberry. Shaped dark pigment stones up to 1 cm in diameter..  The residual mucosa is unremarkable. with a green velvety appearance.. The wall measures up to 0.1 cm in thickness.. No cystic duct lymph node is identified. Representative sections from the fundus, mid body, and cystic duct resection margin are submitted in one cassette.  The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin and labeled. right lobe of liver. The specimen consists of a resection specimen of liver tissue weighing 1.570 kg. There is a blue suture attached to the inferior edge. The anterolateral surface appears dusky and discolored with areas of pallor, possibly capsular fibrosis, but without any obvious involvement by tumor. The diaphragmatic area is unremarkable and the left retrohepatic peritoneal surface is unremarkable. There is a this margin and this is painted blue..  The lobe measures 19 cm from superior to inferior,. 18 cm from medial to lateral, and approximately 10 cm from the anterior surface to the deep bare area. Transverse incisions into the liver lobe shows it to be expanded and hemorrhagic cut surface with viable areas of tumor showing a pale yrey to yellow green color.  The tumor itself has dimensions of 14.5 x 8 x 15 cm (photographs has been taken. of the transverse section showing the multilobulated tumor). There is no obvious extension of the tumor into vascular structures grossly, but at. the resection margin,. there is large duct or vascular channel that appears to have a granular material balling up on its lining. This is also visible more distant from the hilar zone of this resection specimen.  Further sectioning shows this to extend to the hilar resection margin. This appears to extend to the painted resection margin at the vascular hilum of the lobe.

 Page 3 of 3 Adjacent liver does not show any significant nodularity to suggest underlying cirrhosis. Sections are taken as follows: B1-13. sections at hilum of lobe to illustrate interface between tumor and resection. margin and to. illustrate potential vascular invasion and vascular extension to resection margin 814-16. additional sections of tumor close to rese. ion margin B17-23. tumor in relationship to capsule B24/25. tumor B26-30. sections of surrounding liver parenchyma. Microscopic Description. A.  Sections show gallbladder wall with minimal inflammation but focal areas with. Aschoff-Rokitansky sinuses and mild subserosal fibrosis consistent with mild chronic cholecystitis. No atypia is present.. B.  The resection shows a hepatocellular carcinona that has a somewhat lobulated architecture forming large rounded nodules of tumor. The tumor cells show mild to. moderate nuclear atypia growing in broad sheets of cells, showing focal pseudoglandular areas with accumulation of bile, as well as showing prominent fatty change.  Prominent The HCc closely approaches the painted resection margin,. but direct extension is not present,. with a clear margin that is focally as close as 3.0 and 2.0 mm in two of the sections In multiple areas the granular material appears to involve lareger vascular spaces, with granulatomatous changes in the walls of veins related to intraluminal foreign material consistent with pre-operative embolization.. In smaller portal tracts this is clearly in. the portal venous system. No clear evidence of perineural or vascular invasion can be identified. The adjacent liver parenchyma shows portal triadiris as well as areas of granulomatous inflammation related to portal veins. The portal tracts are mildly expanded, but there is no clear evidence of an underlying cirrhosis or chronic liver disease.. Accession Number Encounter Number Patient Location 3 CISQUALIFH
