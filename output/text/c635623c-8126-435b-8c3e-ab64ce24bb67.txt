Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Renal mass Gross Description: The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received in formalin. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen which together with perinephric fat weighs 446 grams. It measures 17.5 cm from superior to inferior, 9 cm from medial to lateral, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. Along the medial-superior edge of the perinephric fat there is a intact appearing 6.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm portion of adrenal gland. Along the anterior surface of the kidney there is a thin delicate membranous tissue consistent with Gerota's fascia approximately measuring 10 x 5 cm. The central-lateral surface of the nephrectomy specimen is torn and disrupted exposing the cortical surface of the kidney which is bulging. Serial sections of the adrenal gland reveal no gross evidence of tumor involvement. At the hilum of the kidney the renal artery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and there is no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney is a small caliber portion of ureter which is 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The ureter is opened to the renal pelvis to reveal the urothelium is tan-white and smooth and unremarkable. Sectioning through the central-lateral surface of the kidney reveals a well circumscribed golden yellow and thinly capsulated appearing neoplasm which overall measures 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm. This neoplasm abuts the cortical surface of the kidney but grossly does not appear to extend through the renal capsule into the small amount of adherent perirenal adlpose tissue. The neoplasm is 3.5 cm from the hilum and hilar vasculature. There is some cautery and cavitatlon of the renal parenchyma just along the superior edge of the tumor suggestive of surgical manipulation. There is some hemorrhage extending into the hilar fat. The kidney away from the neoplasm has a normal reddish brown appearance and the cortical medullary junction appears distinct. The cortical thickness is 0.7 cm. Close sectioning of the remainder of the kidney reveals no additlonal masses. The perinephric adipose tissue is dissected but no Iymph nodes are identified grossly. Also in the specimen container is an additional 7.5 cm aggregate of lobulated fatty tissue which is serlally sectioned and palpably unremarkable. Representative sections of the tumor are obtained for research purposes. Followlng fixation the sections are submitted as summarized below: Section summary: A1) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2) adrenal gland, A3) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvlc Junction, A4) Gerota's fascia, A5-A7) sections of central-lateral tumor and cortical surface of kidney, A7-A8) sections of tumor and immediately adjacent renal tissue. Additional section of tumor adjacent to the renal sinus was submitted in A10, and an additional section of renal artery and renal vein are submitted in cassette A11. Microscopic Description: Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. Case #: Printed:
