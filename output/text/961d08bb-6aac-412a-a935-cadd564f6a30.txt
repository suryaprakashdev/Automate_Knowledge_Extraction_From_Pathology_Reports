GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "sENTINEL NODE #1" is a 3.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm irregular portion of soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm pink-tan lymph node. The lymph node is bisected. One half of the lymph node is submitted in OcT for cbcp protocol, and the remainder is submitted for permanent. 2C2 B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, , designated "ADDITIONAL LyMPH NODE" is a single, tan-brown fragment of soft tissue measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. specimen is submitted in its entirety in one cassette. 1C1 The r Recsivr! in formalin, labeled with the patient's name,. ; designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2" is a lobulated fragment of yeliow, adipose tissue measuring 1.5 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is bisected to reveal one lymph node measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette. 1C2.. D. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFT BREAsr LUMPECTOMy" is a globoid portion of soft tissue oriented with the short stitch superior and long stitch lateral.
