FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA RIVACY FCT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: -year-old with diagnosis of breast cancer, 1.0 cm spiculated mass right breast. GROSS DESCRIpTION: A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE" cOnsists of a 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm piece of fatty tissue containing a 1.0 cm lymph node. The node is bisected and a 1.0 mm thick section of one of the halves is submitted for the CBcp protocol.. Cassette key:. Al: Bisected lymph node. A2: Remainder of the fatty tissue. B. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "RIGHT BREAST MASTECTOMy" consists of a 950.0 gram simple mastectomy specimen, measuring 22.5 cm medial to lateral, 21.0 cm superior to inferior, and 3.8 cm anterior to posterior. The overlying ellipse of. nipple bearing skin measures 15.0 x 7.5 cm and is notable for a well-healed, curvilinear scar 4.3 cm in length, near the superior lateral edge. The specimen is oriented with sutures. The anterior margin is inked. blue, the posterior margin is inked black. Sectioning reveals a 2.0 cm area of indurated area in the lower inner quadrant at the 5:oo position, abutting the anterior medial margin. The remaining tissue is predominantly fatty and unremarkable. Multiple tissue sections taken for the protocol; matching paraffin sections are as follows: B1: Skin, lateral tip. B2-B4: Tumor. B5: Fibrofatty tissue, 2.0 cm from tumor, lower inner quadrant. B6: Fibrofatty tissue, 14.0 cm from tumor, lower outer quadrant B7: Fibrous tissue, 15.0 cm from tumor, upper outer quadrant. B8: Fibrofatty tissue, 9.0 cm from the tumor, upper inner quadrant. B9-B10: Nipple. 10C16 C. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "RIGHT BREAST INFERIOR TISSUE" cOnSists of a 6.5 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm fragment of fatty tissue. The surface is inked in black. Sectioning reveals predominantly fatty tissue with a minimal fibrous component. Representative sections from throughout the lesion are placed in cassettes C1 through C5.. D. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMy" consists of a 1540.0 gram simple mastectomy specimen measuring 24.5 cm medial to lateral, 19.0 cm superior Page 2 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
