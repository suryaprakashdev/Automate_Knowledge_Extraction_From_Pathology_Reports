TCGA-AS-3777 SURGICAL PROCEDURES: NEPHRECTOMY ACTCLINICALHISTORY . OTHER SPECIAL CONSULTATION: TA GROSSDESCRIPTION SA:. The specimen is submitted fresh as "left kidney and ureter" and consists of a kidney removed with attached perirenal fat weighing 361 grams with an overall dimension of 19 x 11 x 5 cm. The kidney measures 10 x 6 x 3.5 cm. The segment of attached ureter measures 8 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. There are several segments of vessel at the hilum ranging in length from 0.4 to 1.5 cm in length and measuring up to 2 cm in diameter. The ureteral mucosa is pale tan with the usual striations. The pelvic mucosa is similar in appearance.  The renal parenchyma is red brown with. normal architecture. There is a 2 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm circumscribed yellow tan tumor adjacent to the renal pelvis which appears to abut upon the renal sinus and approaches to within 0.5 cm of the cortical surface. The calyces are not dilated. The cortex measures up to 0.8 cm in thickness. The capsule strips easily revealing an underlying red brown granular cortical surface. Examination of the attached perirenal fat is unremarkable. The adrenal gland is absent. Representative sections are. submitted, multiple (9) labeled as follows:** Cassette 1: Vessel and ureter margin. Cassettes 2-8: Tumor Cassette 9: Representative uninvolved renal parenchyma. Please note: A portion of tissue is collected for research study. ONAALEINALDIAGNOSISXMS LEFT KIDNEY AND PROXIMAL URETER (NEPHRECTOMY) : RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CHROMOPHOBE TYPE (2.2 CM) . TUMOR IS LIMITED TO THE KIDNEY.
