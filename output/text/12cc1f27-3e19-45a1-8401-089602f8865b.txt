Page 3 of 3 Number examined: Number involved: ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Chronic pancreatitis tunor involves the portal vein CLINICAL HISTORY: Not specified Gross Description Received are specimens A to w All reauisitions and specimen containers are labelled The cassettes and AP identifiers are with the patient's name, labelled with the Surgical Number A. The specimen is received fresh, labelled "omentum" and consists of an irregular. portion of hemorrhagic fatty tissue measuring 35 x 12 x 1 cm. Apart from the hemorrhagic areas, the tissue is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in Al to A3. B. The specimen is received fresh, labelled "node of importance", and consists of fragments of yellow- red soft tissue which measure together approximately 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. Submitted in toto in cassettes Bl and B2. C. The specimen is received fresh, labelled "whipple specimen", and consists of a resection of the proximal duodenum, distal stomach, and head of pancreas. The common bile duct is identified via a stent and this is removed to reveal a dilated bile duct. measuring up to 1 cm in diameter and 4 cm in length. The ampulla demonstrates a slightly irregular granular area which measures 1.3 cm in diameter. The surrounding gastric and duodenal mucosa are otherwise unremarkable. On sectioning deep to the ampuliary region, the pancreatic head is diffusely abnormal and appears replaced by a fibrotic whitish process measuring 3.8 cm. There is no well defined lesion within this although variable areas of fibrosis, hemorrhagic, and microcystic change are noted.No normal pancreas is identified. Cl- Bile duct resection margin c2- proximal gastric margin c3- distal duodenal margin C4-- pancreatic resection margin C5-c10- pancreas lesion C11-c15- potential lymph nodes. D. The specimen is received fresh, labelled "superior mesenteric artery margin", and consists of an irregular portion of fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.3 x 1.6'x 0.5 cm. Submitted in toto in a single cassette Dl. E. The specimen is received fresh labelled "smA margin # 2", and consists of an irregular portion of yellow-white fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. On sectioning, the tissue demonstrates firm white fibrotic tissue. Specimen is bisected and submitted in. toto in cassettes El and E2. F. The specimen is received fresh, labelled "portal vein resection", and consists of an irregular portion of fibroadipose soft tissue measuring 4.8 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm. On sectioning, the tissue is firm and fibrous, but no focal lesions are identified and no vessel lumen is seen. Representative sections are submitted in Fl and F2.
