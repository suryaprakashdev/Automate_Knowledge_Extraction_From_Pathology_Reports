(Specimen is in formalin more than 6 hours and less then 48 hours). It consists of an ovoid piece of yellow-tan fatty tissue with 3 sutures designate 1 silk anterior, 2 silk medial margin and 3 silk posterior margin. Specimen measuring 5 x 4 x 4 cm. The specimen is oriented and inked as follow: Anterior-yellow, posterior- black, superior-orange, inferior-red, medial-blue, and lateral margin with green color. On sectioning cut surface shows 1.5 x I x 1 cm  and irregular ill-defined mass without any area of hemorrhage or necrosis. This mass is 0.5 cm from anterior, 0.3 cm from posterior, 1.0 cm from superior, 1.2 cm from inferior, 1.0 cm from medial and 2.0 cm from the lateral margin of resection. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1-B7 = mass with closest anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior margin.

ESTROGEN RECEPTORS:90%,POSITIVE PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: 80 %, POSITIVE. STAINING INTENSITY: MODERATE HER-2NEU: SCORE 0, NEGATIVE. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block B2) using the following monoclonal antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1), Progesterone receptor (Clone 1E2) and Her-2neu. Clone 4B5); control sections for HER-2Neu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF-7, score 1+ T-47D, score 2+ MDA-MB-453, score 3+ BT-474). Detection system used: polymer. Primary antibodies, reagents and control sections for HER-2neu are all provided by. All controls show appropriate reactivity. Reactivity of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors is determined based on the percentage of positively stained nuclei of tumor cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage):. Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells. Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong.. HER-2neu reactivity is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Score 0 = Negative: No immunoreactivity, or faint weak immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive..

MRN: Sex/DOB:  Female Patient: Surgical Pathology Report. Collected Date/Time: Accession Number: Received Date/Time: Score 1 = Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive. Score 2+ = Equivocal: Weak to moderate complete membrane immunoreactivity in >10% of tumor cells or circumferential intense membrane staining in <30% of cells. Score 3+ = Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform membrane staining. A homogeneous (chicken wire) pattern should be present. In the evaluation of the score the pathologist is assisted by the computerized Equivocal results for HER-2neu (Score 2+) will be subsequently followed by a reflex dual-color ISH testing.. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (Block B6, B8) with adequate positive and negative control sections.
