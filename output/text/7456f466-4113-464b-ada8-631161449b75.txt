A flap of peritoneal fat is present measuring 27.5 x 11:6 by iess than 0.1 cm. The peritoneal surface is smooth and glistening. The bladder itself measures 6.2 x 5 x 3.6 cm.  The resection margin and prostate are inked black with red ink superimposed on the right side.  The bladder is then opened along the anterior prostatic urethra and bladder wall.

The mass extends. into the deep muscle of the bladder wall but does not penetrate the surrounding soft tissue grossly.. It extends into the ureterovesical junction over a distance
