Tho specinon is recoived Iresh labeted "right kidney" and consists of a kidnoy with atlached uroter. ronal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 2 g in total. The kidney measures 22 x 15 x 11 cm. The attached ureter measures 2.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diamoter The allached renal vein measures 1.3 cm in longth and 1.1 cm in dianeter. Tho renal vossels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkabte. An adrenal gland is not identifiod. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a large cystic tunor measuring 17 x 11 x 8 cm, involving the upper pole of the cortex and is filled with dark brown necrotic lluid, and yellow-brown, necrotic lissue. The tumor is 5 cm from the uroter margin. Sections through the remainder of tho kidney roveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.7 cm and the calyces appear. normal. No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric fat. Tho specimen is photographed. Represontalivo sections are submitted Summary ol sections: UVM -- ureteral and vesset margins .- lumor TSF -- tumor with sinus fat TK -- lumor with adjacent kidney RP -- renal pelvis represenlative sections.
