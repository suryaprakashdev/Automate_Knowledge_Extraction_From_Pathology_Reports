THE DOMINANT mASS OF iNVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES 1.9 Cm iN LARGEST DIMENSION. D. THE SATELLiTE FOCUS MEASURES 0.6 CM AND IS PRESENT 0.5 CM AWAY FROM THE MAIN MASS. E.  Ductal Carcinoma in-Situ (dcis), nuclear Grade 2, Cribriform type. F. THE DCIS CONSTITUTES 10% Of thE TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME AND IS ADMIXED WITH INVASIVE COMPONENT. G.  NO LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS NOTED. H. THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA (DOMINANT MASS) FOCALLY EXTENDS TO THE SUPERIOR MARGIN AND IS <0.1 Cm TO THE POSTERO-iNFERIOR MARGIN. 1.

FOCAL EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION (<0.1 CM) IS IDENTIFIED. PaRt 4: LEft Sentinel Lymph nODE #2, bIOpSy - Two lymph nodes, negative for metastatic tumor (0/2). COMMENT: The invasive tumor nuclear grade is variable and ranges-from nuclear grade 2 to nuc!ear grade 3. The highest grade is taken into account for Nottingham scoring and grading. MICROSCOPIC: Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.. Antibody/Antigen Result E-cadherin Membranous reactivity in invasive tumor cells. P120 Membranous reactivity in invasive tumor cells. Utilizing formalin-fixed (8-96 hour range). paraffin embedded tissue, immunohistology is performed with the following selected antibodies and designated antibody clone(s). directed against the following antigenic target(s). with adequate positive and negative internal and external controls. Antibodies are optimized appropriate for fixation times. ANTIBODY CLONE TARGET ANTIGEN VENDOR E-cadherin 36 Ductal Carcinoma P120 98 Lobular carcinoma
