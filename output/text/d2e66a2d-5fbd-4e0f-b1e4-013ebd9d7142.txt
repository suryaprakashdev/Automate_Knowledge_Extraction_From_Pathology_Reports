MICROSODPIC Sections show fibrous tissue in which there is no significant abnormality. 2.  Sections show an encapsulated adrenal tunour comprising cells with large anount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and pleanorphic muclei. forming trabeculae and clustes. There is marked tumour necrosis. Mitoses focally measure up to 18/10 HPF.. Immmoperoxidase studies show staining of the tumour cells for HmB45. inhibin and synaptophysin..  There is no staining for cytokeratin and chramogranin A. The appearances are consistent with an adrenocortical carcincma. 3. Sections show trabeculae of abnormal cells with focal overlying endothelial cells and organising thrombi. The appearances are consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma.  Sectians show trabeculae of aknormal cells invading the fibrous tissue. carcinama. 5.  Sections show nodular fibrous tissue with overlying mesotheliun. The appearances are consistent with organised torted ayperdix epiploicae. OCNCTOSHION 1. Front of duoxdanm - Fibrous nodule.. 2.
