SPECIMEN: A. R. breast lump. Nylon suture at posterior margin. Beige suture superior margin. B. Sentinel node #1. C. Sentinel node #2. D. Right breast tissue (black suture most superior margin). E. Right breast tissue (black suture at most anterior margin). HISTORY Right breast cancer. GROSS A. Received fresh in a container labeled *right breast tissue" is a. fragment of fibrofatty breast tissue (5.7 cm in medial-lateral. dimension, 7 cm in superior-inferior dimension, 1.8 cm in anterior-posterior dimension) oriented by attached sutures. An accompanying specimen radiograph reveals abundant radiodense tissue. The density corresponds to a sclerotic. gray-white, hard tumor mass (2.8 cm in greatest dimension) which is within 1-2 mm of the anterior margin, 0.5 cm from the posterior margin, 0.6 cm from the. medial margin, approximately 1.4 cm from the lateral margin and 1.2. cm from the superior margin. The remaining parenchyma consists of abundant firm white fibrous tissue with scattered cysts up to 2-3 mm. in diameter, along with dilated ducts containing opaque yellow-tan, paste-like material.  Total fixation time in formalin is approximately 28 hours. A representative portion of the tumor is submitted for the Ink Code: Black - posterior. Blue - anterior. Green - lateral. Criter Red - medial. Orange - superior. Purple - inferior. J33 Printed by: UUID:14E2FC4E-7205-4929-8185-7FF3006F08AD TCGA-AC-A3QP-01A-PR Redacted Page 1 of 4 Printed on: (Continued)

Surg Path Final Report * Final Report * Microscopic foci of invasive lobular carcinoma (up to 5 mm in greatest dimension). Tiny focus of lobular cancerization. Neoplasm is approximately 4-5 mm from most superior margin (black inked margin, adjacent to suture) and at blue inked opposing aspect. E.  Right breast tissue, excision:. No tumor is seen. COMMENT BREAST CARCINOMA SUMMARY: SPecIMEN: Partial breast. PROCEDURE: Lumpectomy. SPEcIMEN INrEGRITy: Single intact with additional margin submitted in parts c (superior margin) and D (anterior margin). SPECIMEN LATERALITY: Right breast lumpectomy. SPECIMEN SIZE: 5.7 x 7 x 1.8 cm. TUMOR SIZE:  2.8 cm. TUMOR FocaLITy: A 2.8 cm focus of invasive lobular carcinoma, and additional tiny foci (up to 5 mm) of invasive lobular carcinoma away from tumor. SKIN INVOLVEMENT: Skin not present. NIPPLE INVOLVEMENT: Nipple not present. SKELETAL MUSCLE INVOLVEMENT: Skeletal muscle not present. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) : Negative. LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS) : Present. HIsToLogic Type: Invasive lobular carcinoma. GRADING (NOTrINGHAM) : Tubular formation score: Score 3. NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM SCORE: ScOre 2. MITOTIC RATE SCORE: ScOre 1. COMBINED GRADE (NOTTINGHAM): Grade 2 (intermediate grade). LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: Not identified. MARGIn OF ExcisioN: Final margins appear free of tumor (closest margin is superior. approximately 4-5 mm. part D). Lymph Nopes: One sentinel lymph node involved by metastatic lobular. carcinoma (sentinel lymph node #l, part B (largest tumor focus is 2 mm) (1/2). MICROCALCIFICATION: Not identified. OTheR FINDINGs: Fibrocystic changes, usual ductal hyperplasia. HORMONE REcEPrORs: Reported (estrogen receptor positive (70t, strong): Progesterone receptor positive (over 9ot, strong). HER-2/NEU: Reported (equivocal (2+) by immunohistochemistry, FISH pending. PATHOLOGIC TNM (AJCC EDITION): T2 N1mic MX. NOTE: A cytokeratin E1/e3 immunohistochemical stain was performed on parts B (sentinel lymph node #1) and C (sentinel lymph node #2). It is strongly positive on part B (sentinel lymph node #1) within the metastatic tumor cells, and supports the diagnosis. It is negative within part c lsentinel lymph node #2). consistent with benign lymph node. Printed by:  Page 3 of 4 Printed on: (Continued)
