aegment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon. The terminal ilaum measures 8 cm in length and 3.4 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 34 cm in length with a circumference of 8 cm at the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measurea 7.2 cm in length and averagea 0.6 cm in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue apans the length of the specimen measuring up to S cm in thicknesa. The specimen is opened to reveal a mass lesion measuring 4 cm in length and 5.4 cm in width Sectioning shows tbat the tumor invades into the paricolic fat. The depth of nvasion is 0.5 cm grossly. The lesion is 5 cm from the distal margin. There ia attached omental fat measuring 25 x 12 x 1.5 cm. It ia grossly unremarkable. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable.Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached adipoae tissue and are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are gubmitted for permanent sections and for TPS.
