UUID: 5D79D370-F174-4CCB-AF64-5617EBF352BE0 Supplementary Report. TCGA-ZS-A9CF-02A-PR Redacted Nature of Specimen(s). 1. Left lobe liver 2. Portal lymph node - 1. MALE clinical Information Supplied Left hepatectomy today. Past medical history of primary hepatocellular carcinoma segment 5&6 resected . Haemochromatosis. lesion ... FROCREMENt J/E: Macro Report 1. Received is a left lobe of liver measuring 132x95x58mm. The surgical resection margin is inked blue. On transverse slicing J 2 distinct tumour nodules each with a hard or cream-white cut surface are noted. Focal areas of necrosis and softening are present. The larger lesion measures 72x59x45mm and the smaller 60x35x44mm. The larger lesion is 4mm from the inked blue resection margin. The smaller lesion is clear by approximately 26mm. An area of firm white scarring is present at the resection margin. This is especially clear near the larger lesion. 2. A fragment of brown-white tissue 2lx8x8mm. On transverse slicing a lymph node is revealed. Micro Report. 1. Sections confirm two tumours with morphological features consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. Both tumours show an anastomosing trabecular architecture with large atypical cells bearing abundant cytoplasm and focally producing bile. The larger lesion is associated with spread into small branches of portal veins. Although the lesion approaches close to the inked resection margin the final resection margin is entirely clear of tumour. The smaller of the 2 lesions, as noted macroscopically, is well clear of the resection margin. Adjacent liver parenchyma shows some chronic inflammation in portal areas and steatosis. Both are mild in degree. There is no obvious evidence of iron pigment on routine staining however liver histochemistry will be performed and results issued in a supplementary report.
