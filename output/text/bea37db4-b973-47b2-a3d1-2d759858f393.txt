B: Sentinel lymph node #l, removal. - One benign lymph node, negative for malignancy. C: Sentinel lymph node #2, removal One benign lymph node, negative for malignancy. (D:) Breast, right, mastectomy. Invasive ductal carcinoma, Overall grade 3. The tumor size is 2.5 cm. No 1ymphovascular space invasion is identified. Surgical margins are free of. invasive carcinoma. - Tumor estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative. - her2/neu overexpressed (score-3+).  Ductal carcinoma in situ, comedo subtype, nuclear grade 3 with necrosis, comprising approximately 5% of the tumor. The surgical margins are negative for DCIS. Comment: Additional levels of the sentinel nodes performed as per sentinel lymph node protocol are all negative for carcinoma.. Clinical History: The patient is a -year-old female with right breast. carcinoma and a left breast mass who undergoes bilateral mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy mapping. Gross Description:. Received are four appropriately containers.. Container A is additionally labeled "left breast, short. superior, long lateral." Specimen fixation: received fresh and placed in formalin

of an ovoid, pale gray/tan lymph node measuring 1.8 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. The lymph node is bisected and submitted in block Bl. Container c is additionally labeled "sentinel lymph node #2" and consists of an ovoid, gray/purple lymph node measuring 6 mm in greatest. dimension. The lymph. node is bisected and submitted entirely in block cl.. Container D is additionally labeled "right breast." Specimen fixation: received fresh and placed in formalin. Type of mastectomy: simple. Size of specimen: 20.5 x 15.5 x 4.0 cm Orientation of specimen: a long suture marks the lateral aspect while a short suture marks the superior aspect; the superficial aspect is marked with blue ink and the deep resection margin is marked with black ink Skin ellipse dimensions: 13.8 x 4.2 x 0.2 cm; scars and lesions are not identified grossly, however, the specimen. at the skin has previously been dyed blue at the time of surgery Nipple/areola: the grossly unremarkable nipple measures 1.5 cm in diameter and is surrounded by an unremarkable. 4.3 cm areola Axillary tail: not identified grossly Biopsy site: not identified. Residual tumor: A 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm indurated, pale gray/white, previously dyed blue, well. circumscribed ovoid mass is identified. Location of tumor: in the outer half of the specimen, at the junction of the. upper and lower halves. Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: the mass. extends to within. 5 mm

There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy. (Specimen D - right breast) Presence/absence of invasive carcinoma: present Histologic tumor type/subtype: ductal Histologic grade: Overall grade - 3. Architectural grade - 3
