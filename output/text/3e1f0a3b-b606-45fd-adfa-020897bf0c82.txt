Surgical Pathology - Working Draft 6. Skin with no significant pathologic abnormality. 7. No carcinoma identified. E. Breast, left, mammoplasty: 1. Usual ductal hyperplasia. 2. Apocrine metaplasia. 3. Fibroadenoma.e 4. Skin with no significant pathologic abnormality.. S. No carcinoma identified. Note: This is an unusual tumor. H&E sections show a relatively circumscribed tumor with large nests of epithelial cells in a cribriform growth pattern. The stroma is sclerotic. The differential diagnosls. includes adenoid cystic carcinoma or a cribriform varlant of invasive ductal carcinoma. A prlor core needle biopsy of the left breast at 6 o'clock (. ) was reviewed. Immunohistochemical studies were necessary to evaluate this case and establish the correct diagnosis. The following immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated: ER: Positive, 2+ staining in 75% of cells. PR: Negative, no staining in any tumor cells. (internat positive control present) CD117: Positive. SMA: Focally positive, relatively high background.. SMm: No myoepithelial cells present around most nests of tumor cells. p63: Positive in basaloid celis in most areas. The above immunohistochemical stains support a diagnosis if adenoid cystic carcinoma. Although ER expression is often negative in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the presence of basal cell immunophenotype (positive p63) and the positlve CD117 support this diagnosis. Insofar as adenold cystic carcinoma represents a dual population of basalold and epithelial cells, it may be that this exanple is somewhat rich in the epithelial component thus explaining the ER positivity. The above interpretation may also explain the rather diffuse CD117 stainlng. The absence of a define myoepitheliat layer by the SMM further supports the diagnosis. We recognize that this tumor was also sent for gene expression. profiling so correlation with those findings for a basaloid expression proflle is also suggested. Drs.  have reviewed selected stides form this case and concur wlth the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma.. Breast Tumor Synoptic Comment - Laterality: Left. - Invaslve tumor type: Adenoid cystic carcinoma.. - Invasive tumor size: 1.2 cm. - Invasive tumor grade (modified Bloom-Richardson):.

Surgical Pathology -. Working Draft - Lobular carcinoma In situ: None.. - Lymph node status: Negative.. - Tota! number sampled: 2. - AJCC/UICC stage: pT1cNOMX. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression.. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block C3 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The stalning Intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with stalning intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a sta!ning intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining intenslty scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore Submitted for FiSh testing. The results of the FIsh test are Issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohlstochemical and FIsh testing, and almost always show gene amplificatlon.  In addition to the above findings, several lymph nodes are enlarged with a fairly monotonous population of small lymphocytes, concerning for lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains were performed to characterize the small lymphocyte population as follows: - CD20: Highlights widely scattered aggregates of small lymphoid cells, consistent with primary follicles. - CD3: Highlights small lymphocytes predominantly in interfollicular areas. - CD21: Highlights aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, confirming their identity as B cell follicles. - CD23: Highllghts aggregates of dendritic cells underlying B cell aggregates, conflrming their identity as B cell folllcies. Together, these findings are consistent with a diagnosis of benign quiescent nodes, and argue against a diagnosis of iymphoma.
