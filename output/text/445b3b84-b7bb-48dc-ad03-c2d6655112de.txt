Comment: Special stains support the diagnosis. The tumor demonstrates. positive staining for Hale's colloidal iron, ck7 and cDll7.' The tumor cells are negative for vimentin, cdio, cD15 and Rcc.. Appropriate controls are performed. Clinical History: The patient is a -year-old man with an incidentally discovered renal mass.. Gross Description: Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: partial nephrectomy Side of specimen: left Size and weight of specimen: 33 grams, 4.8 x 4.6 x 3.6 cm; There. is also a black stitch to mark the tumor capsule, focally ruptured during extraction. Orientation: The fat overlying the kidney capsule is inked blue. The parenchymal margin is inked black. Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent. Tumor site: Cortex Tumor description: The tumor is a solid, tan, well circumscribed. mass. The tumor abuts the renal capsule and is less than 0.1 cm from the fat overlying the capsule (blue margin), and 0.1 cm from the parenchymal margin (inked black).. Tumor size: 3.8 x 3.4 x 0.2 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: Confined; the mass. appears to be grossly abutting the capsule but is confined to. kidney. Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: does not involve. Gerota' s fascia: n/a

Renal vein: n/a Ureter: n/a Renal Sinus: no evidence of invasion. Pelvicaliceal: n/a Adrenal: n/a Other organs: n/a Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: The tumor is less than 0.1 cm from the blue inked margin.. Renal vein: n/a Renal artery: n/a. Ureter: n/a Description of kidney away from tumor: There is little uninvolved kidney parenchyma present. The tumor is present primarily within the cortex with limited portions of medulla evident, the renal parenchyma is tan/brown and firm.. Hilar lymph nodes: n/a Other significant findings: There is a 7.9 x 5.5 x 0.9 cm additional fragment of adipose tissue received separately in the container, and is grossly unremarkable..
