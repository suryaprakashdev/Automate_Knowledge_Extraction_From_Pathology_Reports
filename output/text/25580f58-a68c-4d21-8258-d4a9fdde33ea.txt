B. RT MASTECTOMY C. LT SENTINEL NODE #1 D. LT SENTINEL NODE #2 PART A RECEIVED LABELED LEFT MASTECTOMY STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK, IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMN MEASURING 15 X 15 X 3.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSIONS. THE NIPPLE IS IN THE INFERIOR PORTION OF A SKIN ELLIPSE MEASURING 9.7 X 5.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSIONS. A SUTURE DENOTES 12 O'CLOCK.  BLUE DYE IS NOTED IN THE SUPERIOR PORTION OF THE SPECIMEN. THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN IS MARKED IN BLUE INK, THE DEEP MARGIN IN BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS THE CENTRAL ASPECT OF THE BREAST TO CONSIST OF DENSE TAN FIBROUS TISSUE WITH FOCAL CYSTIC AREAS WITH BROWN MUCINOUS MATERIAL. THIS IS SURROUNDED BY BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE AT THE PERIMETER. IN THE SUPERIOR 12 O'CLOCK AREA, THERE IS A DISTINCT PINK-TAN GRITTY AREA WITHIN THIS FIBROUS TISSUE WHICH MEASURES 1.6 X 1.3 X 3.5 CM, WHICH SPANS INTO THE 2 O'CLOCK AREA WHERE THERE IS FOCAL RED-TANS DISCOLORATION SUGGESTIVE OF PREVIOUS BIOPSY. GROSSLY, THESE AREAS OF FIRMNESS ARE CONTIGUOUS.  THIS LESION IS O.5 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. WING CLIP IS IDENTIFIED IN THIS 12 O'CLOCK AREA. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: AI--SKIN AND NIPPLE, A2 AND 3--12 O'CLOCK LESION WITH DEEP MARGIN (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), A4--TISSUE SUPERFICIAL TO LESION TO INCLUDE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN AND SKIN, A5--2 O'CLOCK AREA (MIRROR~IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), A6--2 O'CLOCK AREA WITH DEEP MARGIN, A7--TISSUE SUPERFICIAL TO A8, A8--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT TISSUE BETWEEN THE 12:00 AND 2:00 AREAS (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), A9--UPPER INNER QUADRANT 2 CM FROM THE 12 O'CLOCK LESION, A10--LOWER INNER QUADRANT 3.5 CM FROM THE 12 O'CLOCK LESION, A11--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT 3.5 CM FROM THE 12 O'CLOCK LESION (NOTE: A9 THROUGH A1O ARE MIRROR IMAGES TO PROTOCOL SECTIONS).S A12--TISSUE FROM CENTRAL BREAST, A13--ADDITIONAL TISSUE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT . PART B RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT MASTECTOMY STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK, IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN WITH OVERALL DIMENSIONS OF 20 X 16.5 X 3.0 CM.  THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE AND SITS WITHIN A 9 X 4.5 CM SKIN ELLIPSE.  A SUTURE DENOTES 12 O'CLOCK.  THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED IN BLUE, THE DEEP MARGIN IN BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS THE
