Clinical History: This is a  year-old female with history of a right papilloma. A screening mammogram in showed suspicious densities with calcifications in the left outer quadrant. By exam showed a 1.5 cm quasi suspicious mass at 4-5:00, 3 cm outside the areola margin on the left breast. , she had a. FNA of the left breast showing carcinoma. On  breast MRI on the left showed an outer quadrant 4.7 x 3.2 x 3.3 cm enhanced mass with three additional suspicious foci: one anterior and superior to the index mass, one adjacent to the nipple, and one suspicious focus at 12 o'clock. The patient undergoes a left breast sentinel node biopsy and simple mastectomy. Specimens Received: A: Sentinel Node #1 B: Sentinel Node #2 C: Left Breast Mastectomy with Sentinel Node Biopsies Gross Description: The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient' s name and medical record number. A. Container A is further designated 31. sentinel node #14. Received for frozen section diagnosis is a 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm rubbery portion of yellow, lobulated tissue with blue discoloration. It is read as 3one lymph node, negative for carcinoma4 by The specimen is entirely submitted as A1FS. B. Container B is further designated 32. sentinel node #24. Received for frozen section diagnosis is a 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm portion of pink-tan rubbery tissue consistent with a lymph node. It is bisected and read as 3one lymph node, negative for carcinoma4 by The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette B1FS in a mesh bag. C. Container C is further designated 33. left breast mastectomy with sentinel node biopsies4. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 975 gm, 39 x 18 x 6 cm mastectomy specimen with an ellipse of white-tan skin with blue discoloration (27 x 11.2 cm), areola (4.7 x 4.5 cm), and nipple (1.2 x 1.0 x0.4 cm). The specimen is oriented as follows: short suture superior, long suture lateral. The deep margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned into 13

slices from lateral (slice #1) to medial revealing a 5 x 5.5 x 4 cm ecchymotic area in the lower lateral quadrant located in slices #4-7. There is a well-circumscribed, firm, white mass measuring 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm in slice #5, 5.5 cm from the deep margin. It is located inferior to the ecchymotic region. At 2-3 o'clock adjacent to the firm mass is an ill-defined, gritty, indurated area primarily in slices #7 and #8. It extends superomedially with a span of 5.0. x 3.5 x 2.0 cm and is located 2.5 cm from the deep margin. Note: slices #7 and. #8 contain the nipple and areola region. Cassette SummaryC1: nipple C2-C4: areola, serially sectioned C5: section of the main mass in slice #5 with respect to closest distant from deep margin C6-C7: one representative section immediately superior and anterior to the main lesion from slice #5 C8: section of hematoma from slice #5 anterior and medial to the main lesion C9: section of hematoma from slice #6, directly medial to the main lesion. C10: section 2 cm superior, anterior, and medial to the main lesion from slice #7 C11: representative sections from slice #8, representing ill-defined, gritty, firm tissue C12-C13: section from slice #7 also representing ill-defined, gritty, firm tissue C14: another section from slice #7 immediately inferior to the section C12-C13 C15-C16: section from 12 o'clock on section #8 C17-C18: sections from slice #9 C19: another representative section from section #9 C20-C21: lateral upper quadrant from slices #3-4, respectively C22-C23: lateral lower quadrant from slices #2 and #3, respectively C24-C25: upper medial quadrant from slice #11 and #12, respectively C26-C27: medial lower quadrant from slices #11 and #12, respectively Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis: A1FS. Sentinel node #1: One lymph node, negative for carcinoma B1FS. Sentinel node #2: One lymph node, negative for carcinoma..
