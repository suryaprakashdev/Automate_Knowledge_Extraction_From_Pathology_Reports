SURGICAL PATHOL Report - The tumor cells are positive for p-cadherin and negative for CK5/6 and EGFR by Immunohistochemistry.. MD Intraoperative Consultations Right axilla, FS: 3 lymph nodes: no tumor on frozen section. Await sentinel node protocol for definitive diagnosis. MD Clinical History: Patient with biopsy proven G3 cancer right breast 1 for needle localization segmental mastectomy with SLN3. Please evaluate sentinal nodes for metastasis and do Immunohistochemistry on permanents if frozen negative, evaluate lumpectomy.  margins. Operation Performed Right needle localization mastectomy with SLNB, possible AND, right lumpectomy. Pre Qperative Dlagnosis:. Cancer right breast Specimen(s) Recelved: A: Right axilla fs B: Right lumpectomy one suture superior , two medial Gross Description: A.  Received fresh for frozen section is an irregular fragment of fibroadipose tissue, measuring 3.2 x 2.0 x 1.1 cnj. Seven lymph nodes are identified at the time of consultation. In the rest of the adipose tissue two possible lymph nodles are identified. The fragments are submitted in toto as follows: 1-3 One lymph node per cassette for frozen section 4&5 One additional lymph node per cassette 6&7 The rest of the fibroadipose tissue B. Received in formalin is a lumpectomy specimen, measuring 8.9 cm from medial to lateral, 8.2 cm from anterigr to posterior, 2.3 cm in from superior to inferior. A metallic localization needle is located in the anterior aspect of the specimen. Surgical margins are inked as follows: superior inked blue, inferior inked green, medial inked red, fateral inked. orange, anterior inked yellow, posterior inked black. Upon sectioning at the tip of the needle localization an irnregular firm, tan and white area is identified, measuring, 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.2 cm. This area is up to, 0.1 cm from the inferior margin, 1.5 cm  from the deep posterior margin, 4.5 cm from the anterior margin, 2.3 cm from the lateral margin, 1.0 cm from the superior margin, 3.2 cm from the media! margin. Representative section of the tumor is submitted for tissue bank. Other areas of the specimen are fibroadipose with a stroma to fat ratio of 10:90. Representative sections are submitted as fojlows: 1&2 Sections of the tumor in relation with the inferior and superior margins. 3 Tumor in relation with the deep margin 4&5 Additional sections (composite) of the tumor in relation with the inferior and deep margins. 6 Lateral margin 7  Medial margin 8 Anterior margin 9-11 Additional sections of the tumor.
