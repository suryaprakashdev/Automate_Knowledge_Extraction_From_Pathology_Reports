RT BREAST TISSUE PART A RECEIVED LABELED LEFT BREAST 7 O'CLOCK SUPERFICIAL MARGIN INK MARKS NEW MARGIN, IS AN OVOID FLAT PORTION OF YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 6 X 4 X O.9 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSIONS. INK IS FOUND ON ONE SIDE OF THE SPECIMEN. THIS IS RE-INKED WITH BLUE INK WITH A PERIMETER OF BLACK INK. THIS IS SECTIONED AND SUBMITTED ENTIRELY LABELED A1 THROUGH 6. PART B RECEIVED LABELED LEFT BREAST STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK, IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN MEASURING 16 X 16 X 5.2 CM.  THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 9.5 X 4.8 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. BLUE DYE IS NOTED IN THE MID-SUPERIOR PORTION OF THE SPECIMEN. A SUTURE DENOTES 12 O'CLOCK. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP MARGIN WITH BLACK INK.   SECTIONING REVEALS THE CENTRAL 8Ot OF THE SPECIMEN TO CONSIST OF FIRM PINK-TAN TISSUE WITH SOME CYSTIC AREAS. THERE IS ILL-DEFINED INDURATION WITHIN THIS FIBROUS TISSUE AS WELL AS FOCAL NODULARITY. MOST INDURATED TISSUE MEASURES 9.0 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, 9.0 CM THE FROM MEDIAL TO LATERAL AND UP TO 3.8 CM FROM SUPERFICIAL TO DEEP.  THIS IS IN THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE BREAST. GROSSLY, THIS INVOLVES THE CENTRAL FOUR QUADRANTS OF THE SPECIMEN. THE CENTRAL LESIONAL AREA IS GREATER THAN 1 CM FROM THE SUPERIOR, INFERIOR, MEDIAL AND LATERAL MARGINS GROSSLY. SECTIONING THE CENTRAL FIBROUS TISSUE REVEALS A MOTTLED PINK TO GRAY-WHITE APPEARANCE. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: B1--NIPPLE, B2--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, B3--UPPER INNER QUADRANT, B4--LOWER INNER QUADRANT, BS--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT. NOTE: B1 THROUGH B5 ARE MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL SECTIONS. B6--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT AND DEEP MARGIN, B7--EXTREME INFERIOR LESION WITH SUPERFICIAL MARGIN (7 O'CLOCK AREA). B8--EXTREME SUPERIOR LESION WITH 5 CM OF INTERVENING TISSUE BETWEEN THIS AND B7, B9--EXTREME MEDIAL ASPECT OF THE LESION, B1O--EXTREME LATERAL

PART C  RECEIVED LABELED LEFT SENTINEL NODE #1 HOT AND BLUE, IS YELLOW-RED FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 2.7 X 2.1 X 1.2 CM. FOCAL BLUE DYE IS NOTED.  SECTIONING REVEALS THIS TO BE A LARGELY FAT-REPLACED LYMPH NODE WITH FOCAL BLUE DISCOLORATION. IN THE ADJACENT TISSUE, THREE ADDITIONAL LYMPH NODES ARE IDENTIFIED MEASURING O.5 TO O.7 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. THE LARGEST GROSSLY FAT-REPLACED NODE IS SUBMITTED AS C1. THE REMAINING THREE NODES ARE SUBMITTED AS C2.S PART D RECEIVED LABELED  LEFT SENTINEL NODE #2 HOT AND BLUE, IS YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 3 X 2.7 X 1.0 CM. SECTIONING REVEALS A 1.4 CM IN GREATEST DIAMETER GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE LYMPH NODE, SUBMITTED LABELED D. PART E RECEIVED LABELED LEFT BREAST ADDITIONAL 12 O'CLOCK MARGIN INK AT NEW MARGIN, IS AN IRREGULAR PORTION OF YELLOW-RED FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 11.5 X 5.3 X 1.0 CM. INK IS FOUND ON ONE SIDE OF THE SPECIMEN. THIS IS FURTHER MARKED WITH BLUE INK WITH A PERIMETER OF BLACK INK.  REPRESENTATIVE TISSUE IS SUBMITTED LABELED E1 THROUGH 10. APPROXIMATELY 7Ot OF THE SPECIMEN IS SUBMITTED.S PART F RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT SENTINEL NODE #1 HOT AND BLUE, IS AN OVOID PORTION OF YELLOW-BLUE TISSUE MEASURING 1.1 X O.5 X O.5 CM.  SECTIONING REVEALS THIS TO BE UNREMARKABLE NODAL TISSUE, SUBMITTED LABELED F. PART G  RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT SENTINEL NODE 2 BLUE AND HOT, IS YELLOW-RED FATTY TISSUE WITH BLUE DYE MEASURING O.8 X O.5 X 0.4 CM. THIS IS BISECTED REVEALING UNREMARKABLE NODAL TISSUE. THIS IS SUBMITTED LABELED G. PART H RECEIVED LABELED IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN MEASURING 20.5 X 18 X 4.5 CM.  THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 9.3 X 6.2 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. FOCAL BLUE DISCOLORATION IS NOTED IN THE 12 O'CLOCK AREA WHERE THERE IS AN ORIENTING SUTURE. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP WITH BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS THE CENTRAL 85t OF THE SPECIMEN TO CONSIST OF PINK-TAN, FIRM FIBROUS TISSUE WITH MULTIPLE CYSTIC SPACES CONTAINING CLOUDY BROWN FLUID. NO DISTINCT MASSES ARE IDENTIFIED.  REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: H1--NIPPLE, H2--CENTRAL DEEP MARGIN, H3 AND 4--UPPER INNER QUADRANT, H5 AND 6--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, H7 AND 8--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT, H9 AND 10--LOWER INNER QUADRANT. NOTE THAT H4 IS THE EXTREME MEDIAL MARGIN.
