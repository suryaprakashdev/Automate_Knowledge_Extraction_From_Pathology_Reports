COmmenT: The tumor exhibils predominat papillary features with focal solid and clear cell morphology. Tumor cells have large eosinophilic to clear cyioplasm and pleomorphic nuclei with open chromatin and occasional nuleoli. By immunostains, the tumor was reactive with CD10 and CA-IX but negative for AE1:AE3, EMA, CK7 and racemase. Staining lor TFE3 and TFEB (for.  translocation renal cell carcinumas) was also nogative. This overlapping morphology and immunoprofile does not allow for placing this tumor in any of the well recognized categories and is thus deignaled UNCLASSIFIED TYPE. The morphology along with the presence of an angionvolinoma however nors that we encountered in patients with tuberous sclerosis. This case was reviewed al 2.

The kidney measures 12.2 x 9 x 4 cm. The altached ureler.  measures 7 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter.  The attached renal vein measures 2 cm in lenglh and 1 cm in diamoter. The renal vessels and ureler margins are grossly unremarkable. An adienal gland is not identified. The kidney is inked black and Page 2 of 3

bivalved to reveal a hemorrhagic golden yellow and red tumor at mid portion measuring 6.5 x 6 x 4.5 cm. Sections through the. remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a welf-defined cortico-medullary junclion. There is a second nodule in the lower pole measuring1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm showing a tan gray cut surlace. The cortex measures 1 cm and the calycos appear. normal. No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric fat. The spocimen is photographed. Represenlative sections are submilted for TPS and for permanent sections. Summary of sections: UM -- ureteral margin, VM- vascular margin, T- tumor, TSF -- lunor with sinus fat.  RP -- renal pelvis representative sections, K -- representative sections kidney, T2- second cortical nodule. 2).The specinen is rece formalin, labeled *preaortic and para-aortic lymph nodes" and consists of muitiple pink tan firm Iymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 3.8 cm in greates! dimension.  All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN -- lymph nodes, BLN -- bisecled lymph nodes, QLN -- quadrisecled lymph node. 3) The specimen is'received fresh labeled as *Lelt adrenal gland suprahilar lymph node" and consists of a fragmented piece of. adipose tissue measuring 9 x 7.5 x 1.5 cm, containing an adrenat gland measuring 6 x 3.5 x 1 cm. The cut section of adrenal. reveals a golden yellow cortex and dark brown medulla, which is grossly unremarkable. The specinen is representatively submitted as follows. Summary of Sections: A- adrenal, F-fat 4). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "hilar lymph node, left' and consists of four pink tan frm lymph nodes ranging. from 0.5 to 1 cm in grealest dimension.
