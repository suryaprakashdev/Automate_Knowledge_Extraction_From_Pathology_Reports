MRN: Patient: Sex/DOB: Female Surgical Pathology Report. Collected Date/Time: Accession Number: Received Date/Time: Source of Specimen  Lymph Nodes, Sentinel Right Axillary B RT. BREAST TISSUE Clinical Information  markings: double long-12:00, single long-6:00, double short-deep PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same T'YPE OF PROCEDURE: Right breast needle localization biopsy and right Sentinel node biopsy. Gross Description Specimen is received in 2 parts: A.The specimen is labeled "RIGHT SENTINEL NODE" and is received unfixed. It consists of 4 x 4 x 1 cm fragment of fatty tissue which reveals 6 lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3-2 x 1 x 1 cm. All lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: A1 = possible two lymph nodes A2 -- bisection of a single lymph node A3-A4 = entire sections of single lymph node Specimen is in formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours Time specimen was removed from the patient: Time specimen was placed in formalin :. Ischemic time: 16 minutes. B. The specimen labeled "RIGHT BREAST TISSUE" is received in formalin. (Specimen is in formalin more than 6 hours and less then 48 hours). It consists of an ovoid piece of yellow-tan fatty tissue with 3 sutures designating double long - 12 o'clock, single long - 6 o'clock and double short - deep margin. A ncedle guide wire is inserted within the specimen.. The specimen measures 5 x 4 x 3.5 cm, is oriented and inked as follows: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-orange, inferior-red, medial-blue, and lateral margin with green color. On sectioning, the cut surface shows centrally, a 2 x 2 x 1.8 cm in ill-defined mass with 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm calcification. Entirely submitted in cassettes B1-B29. Time specimen was removed from the patient: Time specimen was placed in formalin : Ischemic time: One hour 4 minutes. Dictated by: Special Stains / Slides Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (Block s A1, A2, A3 & A4) with adequate positive and negative control sections. A1 and A2 each shows a single positive cells, A3 reveals 2 positive cells and A4 is entirely negative. Immunohistochemical stains were also performed on B18 with appropriate positive and negative controls. The results are as follows: B18- E-cadherin : Pleomorphic LCIS shows speckled pattern Page 4 of 5 Print Date/Time:
