RT BREAST ADDITIONAL POST INK NEW MARGIN PART A  RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT BREAST 10 O'CLOCK LONG EQUALS LATERAL SHORT EQUALS SUPERIOR, IS AN OVOID PORTION OF YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 9.5 X 6.3 X 4.0 CM. THE SPECIMEN IS ORIENTED BY TWO SUTURES AND BLUE DYE IS NOTED WITHIN THE SPECIMEN. SUPERFICIALLY ON THE LATERAL ONE-HALF, THERE IS A SKIN ELLIPSE MEASURING 4.2 X 0.8 CM. NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIRES ENTER THE INFERIOR LATERAL ASPECT OF THE  TWO SPECIMEN. SECTIONING REVEALS THE MAJORITY OF THE SPECIMEN TO CONSIST OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE WITH FINE FIBROUS BANDS. THE SPECIMEN, THERE IS A PINK-TAN GRITTY AREA. THIS IS IN THE MEDIAL  IN THE MIDPORTION OF ONE-HALF, AND LATERAL TO THIS, THERE IS DENSE PINK-TAN FIBROUS TISSUE. THE FIRM AREA MEASURES 1.7 X 1.4 X 2.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSIONS. IS A SECOND FIRM AREA IMMEDIATELY INFERIOR TO THIS AREA WHICH BY THERE PALPATION MEASURES O.7 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. THIS APPROACHES THE INFERIOR MARGIN BY O.3 CM. THE LARGER LESION IS 1 CM FROM THE CLOSEST MARGIN, WHICH IS SUPERFICIAL AND DEEP. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A1--PERPENDICULAR MEDIAL MARGIN, A2--PERPENDICULAR LATERAL MARGIN, A3--CENTRAL TUMOR (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL). A4 THROUGH A8--TISSUE SURROUNDING A3 AS FOLLOWS: DEEP MARGIN, INFERIOR MARGIN TO INCLUDE SEPARATE PALPABLE NODULE, A6--SUPERFICIAL INFERIOR ASPECT, A7--SUPERFICIAL MARGIN, A8--SUPERIOR MARGIN. A9 AND 10--FULL CROSS-SECTION OF LESION TO INCLUDE THE DEEP AND SUPERFICIAL MARGINS, RESPECTIVELY; A11--LATERAL ASPECT OF LESION TO INCLUDE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL). PART B  RECEIVED FRESH LABELED, RIGHT SENTINEL NODE #1 HOT AND BLUE, ARE TWO PORTIONS OF YELLOW-PINK FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 1.7 X 1 X 0.5 CM AND 1.7 X 1.5 X 0.8 CM. IN THE SMALLER PORTION, THERE IS A 0.6-CM GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE LYMPH NODE. THE LARGER PORTION CONSISTS OF FATTY TISSUE WITH FOCAL BLUE DYE. BLUE DYE IS ALSO NOTED WITHIN THE NODE. THE SPECIMEN IS SUBMITTED ENTIRELY LABELED B.
