Page 4 of 7 ovaries and tubes and cervix". It consists of an anterior pelvic exenteration specimen. Overall, the specimen measures 37 x 16 x 4.5 cm and on the posterior surface has an attached smooth, glistening, mobile, pink-yellow peritoneum. measuring 37 x 16 by less than 0.1 cm.  The peritoneum does not appear to be involved by tumor. The specimen consists of a bladder (5 x 5 x 2.5 cm), attached. globoid uterus (7 x 5 x 1.8 cm), attached bilateral fallopian tubes (right 10 cm in iength and 0.4 cm in diameter, left 11 cm in length and 0.4 'cm in diameter), and attached bilateral ovaries (right 2.2 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm, left 3.4 x 1 x 0.8 cm). The uterus and bladder are attached but freely mobile with regard to one another. The specimen surgical resection margins are entirely inked black.. The bladder is. opened along the anterior wall, revealing a pliable uninvolved wall thickness of 1 cm. The right and left ureterovesical junctions are identified and are probe patent. Both ureters' are opened. The right attached ureter measures 5.5 cm in length and o.6 cm in circumference with normal .appearing mucosa. The left attached ureter measures 4.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm circumference.. Involving the left. ureterovesical junction, left'lateral wall, and left portions of the posterior  wall and trigone is an ulcerated, exophytic, firm, gray-yellow, ill-defined tumor which measures 3.5 x.3 x 1.8 cm. Upon sectioning through the tumor, it extende through the bladder wall and into the perivesical fat but does not involve the inked black resection margin or' the peritoneum. The tumor extends to.a depth of i.8 cm and is. 0.2 cm from the inked margin and the peritoneum. Cut surfaces of the tumor are solid, firm, homogeneous, and white. The remainder of the bladder and ureteral. mucosae are gray and wrinkled. No lymph nodes are grossly palpated in .the. perivesical fat. The specimen is returned to the OR at the surgeon's request for gross consultation, at which time he is informed that tumor extends grossly through the bladder wall with clear resection margins. The bladder and ureteral mucosae are then fixed in Bs fixative for one hour and the specimen is subsequently entirely fixed in formalin for a prolonged period prior to taking sections for permanent processing. The serosa of the uterus is tan-pink, smooth and dull.  The fallopian tubes and ovaries are grossly unremarkable. Upon sectioning through the ovaries. the cut sections are white to yellow, solid, firm, and grossly unremarkable. The ectocervix is 'covered by a shiny, pink-white mucosa. The ectocervix measures 3 x. cm and has a flattened os measuring 1.3 x 0.1 cm.  Surrounding the ectocervix is a. rim of wrinkled, gray-pink vaginal mucosa measuring 0.3 cm wide that appears grossly unremarkable.  The uterus is bivalved revealing an endocervical canal. measuring 2.5 cm in length that is lined by a smooth tan mucosa.  The endometrial cavity measures 2.5 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm and is iined by a thin, soft, tan, uniform endometrium 0.1 cm thick.  The myometrium averages 1 cm in thickness and shows no masses or gross abnormalities. Representative sections are submitted in 20 cassettes.

INTRAOPERATIVE GROSS CONSULTATION Bladder, uterus, bilateral tubes, ovaries and cervix (A):. tumor extending through wall with clear margins. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: A-D: See final microscopic-diagnosis.. E: Sections of the bladder show an invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma, grades 3 & 4/4, that involves the left lateral wall (E5-9), trigone (E10), left ureteral vesical junction (E12,13) and base of bladder (Ei4). The tumor extends through the muscularis propria and into the perivesical fat but does not involve the peritoneum or the inked margins..  The closest inked resection margin is 0.2 cm from tumor (Es). Lymphovascular invasion is noted (E8,10,13). Multipl'e foci of of mild to moderate urothelial dysplasia are identified in the left lateral wall (E6, 8), trigone (Elo), right uvJ (E1l), and left uvJ (E12, 13). but no urothelial carcinoma in situ (flat lesion)..
