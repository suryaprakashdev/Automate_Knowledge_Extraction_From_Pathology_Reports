Surgery date: . Surgical Pathology DIAGNOSIS: D. Head of pancreas, duodenum, and common bile duct; Whipple features is identified forming a diffusely infiltrative mass (4.5 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm) in the region of the pancreatic head and possibly arising from an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm). Tumor extends beyond the pancreas to involve peripancreatic soft tissue and the adjacent duodenal wall. The stomach and gallbladder are uninvolved by tumor. Angiolymphatic invasion is identified. Tumor involves the common bile duct and pancreatic duct. The uncinate margin is involved by tumor. The portal vein groove is negative for tumor. The pancreatic body and common hepatic duct margins are negative for tumor (see parts B and C below): however, the uncinate margin remains positive for tumor. Multiple (7 of 21) peripancreatic lymph nodes are UUID:224801AA-21C4-4070-B1FE-BAE31CC383 positive for metastatic carcinoma. TCGA-23-AAB1-01A-PR Redacted B. Pancreas, body margin, excision: Negative for tumor.. C. Common hepatic duct, margin, excision: Negative for tumor. A. Lymph node, common hepatic artery, excision: A single (1) lymph node is negative for tumor.

Received fresh labeled "common hepatic artery lymph nodes" is a 2.4 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm lymph node. Lymph node submitted. Grossed by B. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic body margin with margin up' is a 2.7 x 2.0 x 0.2 cm portion of pancreatic tissue with orientation. Margin submitted. Grossed by C. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic duct margin" is a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm portion of tan-red fibrous tissue without orientation. Margin submitted. Grossed by D. Received fresh labeled "head of pancreas, duodenum, portion of stomach and jejunum, gallbladder" is a Whipple specimen consistent of 52.0 cm in length portion of duodenum, 7.5 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm portion of pancreas, 7.8 x 3.7 x 1.0 cm gallbladder, and a 20.0 x 7.5 x 3.0 cm portion of stomach. The pancreatic uncinate margin is inked yellow and shaved, the portal vein groove is inked black and submitted perpendicularly. There is a 4.5 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm diffusely infiltrative mass within the pancreatic head at the uncinate margin. The mass extends to peripancreatic soft tissue. A stent is present within the common bile duct. The pancreatic neck contains a 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm cyst on a side-branch duct. The gallbladder contains no choleliths. Peripancreatic lymph nodes and periduodenal lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections submitted. Grossed. by BLOCK SUMMARY:
