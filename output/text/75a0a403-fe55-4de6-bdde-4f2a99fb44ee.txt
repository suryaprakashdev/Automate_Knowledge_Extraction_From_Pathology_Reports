Page 2 of 3 LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified PERINEURAL INVASION: Present PRIMARY TUMOR (pT) : pT2:  Tumor limited to the pancreas, more than 2 cm in greatest dimension. REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (pN) : pNO:  No regional lymph node metastasis Number examined: 15 Number involved: 0 Gross Description Received are specimen containers A to n 1  -oquisitions and specimen containers are labelled with the patient's name,. The cassettes and identifiers are labelled with the Surgical Number. A. Specimen is received in formalin.. The container is designated "A: Lymph node of group A". The specimen consists of a fibrofatty soft tissue measuring 2.2 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm. In consists of four potential lymph node candidates, measuring 0.5 to 1.1 cm in maximum diameter. Specimen is submitted as follows: A1. four lymph node candidates A2. three lymph node candidates B. The specimen consists of irregularly shaped fragment; 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. There is an edge that possibly represents the bile duct wall, but no circular structure is present. Submitted in toto in one cassette. Specimen is received fresh. The container is designated "B: Bile duct margin". The  specimen contains an irregularly shaped fragment of soft tissue, measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. There is an edge that represents a possible epithelial duct wall, but no circular structures present. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis.. C. Specimen is received fresh. The container is designated "c: Whipple's specimen". It. consists of a Whipple resection specimen including duodenum, head of the pancreas, and common bile duct stump. The proximal margin of the specimen measures 6.0 cm in circumference. The inferior margin measures 5.0 cm (circumference). The duodenum is 25.0 cm in length, 4.5 cm in average circumference and 0.4 cm in wall thickness. The pancreas measures 3.8 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The common bile duct stump is 6.1 cm in length and i.2 cm in diameter at the margin. The specimen is inked as follows: pancreatic body margin. (distal)- blue, uncinate process- orange, vessel bed area- black. When opened, the duodenal mucosa is velvety and grossly unremarkable. The ampulla of vater is identified and is open to show a 1.2 cm diameter ampulla. Serial sectioning of the pancreas reveals a mass measuring 2.3 x 2.1 x 1.8 cm with non-homogenous white-tan cut surface. The mass is located approximately 1.2 cm away from the duodenal wall and grossly abutting blue and orange resection margins.  The uninvolved pancreas is pink/tan. Multiple lymph nodes are. identified in the soft tissue around the pancreas, measuring 0.3 to 1.1 cm in greater dimension. One node shows hemorrhagic changes. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: C1. proximal bile duct margin, cross section C2 to 4. distal pancreatic margin, posterior to anterior C5. representative proximal gastric/ duodenal margin. c6. representative distal duodenal margin. c7/8.  mass with uncinate margin c9. representative section of common bile duct, cross section C10 to 16. mass with the closest common bile duct (c1o-1l contiguous sections). C17. uninvolved pancreas C18. hemorrhagic nodule C19/20. six lymph node candidates (three lymph nodes each). C21. two lymph node candidates D. Specimen is received in formalin. The container is designated "p: Portal vein margin". It consists of an unorientated fragment of soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette D1.. Frozen Section Diagnosis B. Bile Duct Margin: Negative for malignancy. Reported by: Frozen Section Microscopic. B. Prominent inflammation; loss of surface epithelium; and reactive changes in periductal glands. Pathologist Comment The tumor extends into the black inked edge of the specimen designated as vascular bed. However, a separate portal vein margin is separately submitted (specimen D) which is. negative for malignancy.
