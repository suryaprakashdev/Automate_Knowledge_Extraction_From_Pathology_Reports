The resection margin is inked black. The overlying capsule is tan-pink to purpie, and granular with abundant. nodularity. The capsular aspect is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 5.3 x 5.2 x 4.8 cm, tan-yellow to white,  granular, nodular mass that is 1.3 cm from the liver resection margin.  The mass is multifocal ranging from 0.2 to 5.8 cm in greatest dimensions. hepatic resection margin. The masses grossly extend to the overlying capsule. The uninvolved liver parenchyma is tan-yellow to brown and. unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1-4- largest mass to. resection margin; 5- smallest nodule to closest resection margin; 6-9-. nodules to overlying capsule; 10- largest mass with adjacent. uninvolved liver parenchyma. Please note a representative portion is taken for tissue bank.
