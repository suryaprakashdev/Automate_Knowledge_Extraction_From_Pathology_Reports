The posterior surface of the breast is inked black and the A suture demarcates the axillary aspect is inked green. reveal a 2.5 x 2.2 x 2.3 cm well circumscribed, brown, focally hemorrhagic The specimen is serially sectioned to mass located at the li o'clock axis (upper outer quadrant), 0.9 cm from the deep margin. A metallic clip is identified adjacent to this lesion. Additionally, a 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm tibrous area with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis is present inferior to the 2.5 cm mass in the l1 o'clock axis in the retroareolar region.  The cut surfaces are conposed of 60% fatty and 40% fibrous tissue. No other masses or lesions are grossly identified. Sectioning of the axillary aspect reveals no grossly identifiable lymph nodes.
