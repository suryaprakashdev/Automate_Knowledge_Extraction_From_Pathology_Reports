1cs- 0 -3 Cavcnomu,n`fil+rahng duct, Nos 85oof3 Sit cnde: breost, Nos c50.9 1+/2if10 h Final Diagnosis Breast/right, total mastectomy: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade III (of III),. [tubules 3/3, nuclei 3/3, mitoses 2/3; Nottingham score 8/9], forming multiple (2) masses (central- -2.6 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm and upper inner quadrant--0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm) [AJCC pT2]. Ductal carcinoma in situ, high nuclear grade, composes less than 5% of the tumor volume. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows nonproliferative fibrocytic changes and a fibroadenoma (0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm). Biopsy site changes present. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All surgical resection margins, including the deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 1.4 cm, anterior margin, for the central tumor). Lymph nodes, right axillary non-sentinel, excision: Multiple (2 of 3) right axillary non-sentinel lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma. One of the positive lymph nodes shows focal extracapsular extension. Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (2) right axillary sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma. Blue dye is identified in right axillary sentinel lymph node No. 1. Blue dye is not identified in right axillary sentinel lymph node No. 2. Lymph nodes, right high axillary, excision: Multiple (5) right high axillary lymph nodes are negative for tumor. Lymph nodes, right mid/low axillary, dissection: Multiple (2 of 27) right mid/low axillary lymph. nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN2]. Residual right breast tissue, excision: Residual breast tissue shows non-proliferative fibrocystic changes. Breast, left, simple mastectomy: Benign breast parenchyma with proliferative fibrocystic changes, including a complex sclerosing lesion. Negative for malignancy. Additional left breast tissue, excision: Benign breast parenchyma with non-proliferative. fibrocystic changes; negative for malignancy.
