Final Pathologic Diagnosis: Kidney, right, radical nephrectomy:. Tumor histologic type: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type1 Sarcomatoid features (%): No Tumor size: greatest dimension 3.5 cm (mass overlying psoas muscle) Other dimensions: 3.0 x Macroscopic extent of tumor: Tumor is perinephric fat, no gross involvement of renal parenchyma Focality: (unifocal/multifocal) Multifocal (all in perinephric. soft tissue) If multifocal, number of tumors Four discrete soft tissue masses (see Note) Fuhrman grade: 3 of 4 Perinephric fat invasion: (yes/no) Yes (See Note) Renal sinus invasion: (yes/no) No Renal vein involvement: (yes/no) No Adrenal gland present: (yes/no) No Cancer at resection margin: (yes/no)  No Pathologic findings in nonneoplastic kidney:. Interpolar scar, consistent with history of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. Papillary adenoma (1 mm) Renal cortical cyst in inferior pole, 0.5 cm.. Lymph nodes present:(yes/no) Yes If yes, number involved/number present:. 2/2, with extracapsular extension Pathologic stage rpT4, pN1, pM (not applicable) (See Note). The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were performed by the staff pathologist. Note: Sections of the perirenal fat and psoas muscle nodules show papillary adenocarcinoma, consistent with type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma. We interpret these nodules as recurrent tumor from the patient' s original renal cell carcinoma that arose from reported seeding during the prior laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (pathology material from that procedure is not available for review). The tumor adjacent to the kidney is associated with old scarring and fibrosis likely related to the prior surgical procedure. There is no tumor in the renal parenchymal scar. There is focal invasion of the psoas muscle by the

tumor and so the local pathologic stage is considered rpT4. A small Iymph node with metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma is seen adjacent to the psoas mass. Histologic sections of the unattached mass show a lymph node with metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma. Both nodes show extracapsular extension of the tumor. The dimensions of the tumor nodules in the perirenal fat are: Posterior-superior-medial 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm. Psoas 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. Posterior-inferior-lateral 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Posterior-interpolar-lateral 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Gross Description:. The specimen is received in a container of formalin, labeled with the patient's name and "right radical nephrectomy." It consists of a kidney and surrounding perinephric fat, measuring 16 x 10 x 6.5 cm. An additional portion of adipose tissue accompanies the kidney, measuring 10.5 x 8.0 x 1.5 cm. Prior to receipt in the histology suite, the external surface of the kidney was inked with black ink. The posterior aspect of the kidney was previously sectioned in a coronal plane. A portion of a mass in the posterior-medial-superior perinephric fat was banked for future research. A portion of ureter measuring 10 cm in length by 0.3 cm in diameter is attached to the kidney. The ureter is probe patent. Short segments of the renal artery and vein protrude from the specimen. The renal vein is patent and free of thrombus. The renal artery is patent and free of thrombus. A globular, firm, tan, homogeneous mass traversed by fibrous septae is present in the perinephric fat, posterior-medial-superior to the kidney, measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm. A portion of this mass was previously harvested for research. The surface of the mass abuts the resection margin, but does not appear to penetrate the resection margin. The mass compresses, but does not appear to invade the renal cortex. A portion of psoas muscle is present on the posterior/inferior aspect of the specimen, measuring 4.0 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm. The psoas overlies a globular, firm, tan homogeneous mass traversed by fibrous septae, measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The mass appears to invade the psoas muscle though it does not penetrate to the resection margin. A third firm tan mass is found in the inferior-posterior-lateral pararenal fat, measuring 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. It abuts the surgical resection margin. A fourth firm tan mass is found in the posterior-lateral-interpolar pararenal fat, measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. It abuts, but does not penetrate the renal capsule. It abuts the surgical resection margin. Sections of the kidney show a scar in the interpolar region, measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. A few surgical clips are embedded in the scar. A thin walled cyst is present in the inferior pole of the kidney, measuring O.5 cm in diameter. The unattached fat is sectioned. No lesions are seen. No adrenal gland is present. A firm tan nodule with a smooth surface that is unattached to any of the other tissue fragments is present, measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm. The hilar fat is soaked in Carnoy' s fixative and then dissected for lymph nodes.
