PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS INQUIRY REPORT DAIE PAGE#: 3 Sex: BIRTHDATE: PAT TYPE: ADM DATE: OPER DATE: OPER DATE: PROCEDURE: SPHS History of anemia and right upper quadrant pain. PROCEDURE: SPGD 1. "Right liver surface nodule, rule out metastatic cancer." Received fresh for frozen section is a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm, tan nodule. 1A. Frozen section control. 2. "Right adrenal gland and kidney." Received in formatin in a large container. is a radical nephrectomy specimen (1585 gm), consisting of: kidney (11.7 x 7.5 x 6.2 cm), adrenal tunor (17.1 x 12.5 x 10.3 cm). vena cava (1.5 x 1.8 cm), renal vein (3.2 x 2.6 cm), renal artery (3.9 x 0.5 cm), ureter (5.7 x 0.4 cm) and attached perirenal/periadrenal adipose. The vena cava is remarkable for an exophytic tunor thrombus, which extends 5.7 cm past the margin of resection. The adrenal tumor is inked blue and sectioned to reveal. yellow-brown, variegated and friable cut surfaces remarkable for extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis (75%). The adrenal tumor is encapsulated within a thin, intact membrane. No normal adrenal parenchyma is identified. The adrenal tumor abuts the superior pole of the kidney, however, no involvenent is identitied. Found within the renal medulla of the mid pole is a. 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm, gray, well-circunscribed nodule. The remaining renal. parenchyma is unremarkable. The perirenal/periadrenal adipose, renal vein, renal artery and ureter are uninvolved and unremarkable. There are multiple possible lymph nodes up to 2.1 cm in greatest dimension. This case has been consulted with 2A. Vena cava margin inctuding tumor thrombus. 2B. Renal vein, renal artery and ureter margins. 2c. Two possible lymph nodes submitted whole. 2D. Ore possible lymph node, serially sectioned. 2E. Ore possible lymph node, serially sectioned. 2F-1. Adrenal tumor including capsule. 2J-K. Center of adrenal tumor. 2L. Acrenal tumor to kidney. 2M. Renal nodule.
