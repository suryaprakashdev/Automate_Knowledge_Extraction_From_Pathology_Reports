A touch prep is performed and the Iymph node is submitted entirely in cassette E1. F. ADDITIONAL SENTINEL LYMPH NODE RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh is a piece of yellow-tan tissue 2.5 x 2.1 x 1 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified measuring 1.4 and 1.8 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted separately in cassettes F1-F2.. G. RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1 AND 2 Received fresh is an aggregate of adipose tissue, 7 x 5 x 1.5 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.1 to 2.1 cm; they have a variegated pink-tan cut surface. Lymph nodes submitted as follows: G1-G2: 4 lymph nodes each G3: 6 lymph nodes G4: 2 lymph nodes G5-G8: 1 lymph node each DIAGNOSIS: A.

G. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEVELS 1 AND 2, DISSECTION: - TWENTY LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/20). NOTE: Extensive and multifocal invasive lobular carcinoma is identified. The tumor grossly measures 10-cm. Microscopic examination reveals that the tumor extends from slice #1 to slice #8 (predominantly in the inner half, central and subareolar region, with extension to outer quadrants. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST Specimen Type: Mastectomy Needle Localization: No Laterality:Right) Invasive Tumor: Present Multifocality: Yes WHO CLASSIFICATION Invasive lobular carcinoma 8520/3 Tumor size: 10cm Tumor Site: Upper outer quadrant Lower outer quadrant Upper inner quadrant Lower inner quadrant Central Margins:  Negative Distance from closest margin:  0.2cm deep Tubular Score: 3 Nuclear Grade: 2 Mitotic Score: 1 Modified Scarff Bloom Richardson Grade: 2 Necrosis: Absent Vascular/Lymphatic Invasion: None identified Lobular neoplasia: None Lymph nodes: Sentinel lymph node and axillary dissection Lymph node status: Positive 4 / 27 Extranodal extension DCIS not present ER/PR/HER2 Results ER: Positive PR: Negative HER2: Negative by FISH Performed on Case:  HER2 by FISH performed in outside facility Pathological staging (pTN): pT 3 N 2a SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimen:  Surgical Excision Block Number: D1 ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.  Immunohistochemistry was nerformed usina the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.
