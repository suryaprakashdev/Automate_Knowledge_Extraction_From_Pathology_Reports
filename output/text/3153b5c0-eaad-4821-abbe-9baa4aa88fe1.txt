FOR OFFICIAL OSX ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): Report Electronically Signed Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: yo black female with breast cancer, left inner mid breast g2 (7/9). +lvi, er/pr+, her2/neu 2+, fna+ of left axillary lymph node. Time in formalin: 84 hours. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: breast cancer POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: none provided GROSS DESCRIPTION: A: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "Left Breast Quadrantectomy" is a 408 gm lumpectomy specimen and oriented with a single short black stitch superior, long black lateral, double blue deep, triple blue medial, and anterior margin is inked blue. The specimen measures 19.0 cm superior to inferior, 14.0 cm medial to lateral, and 4.0 cm anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior-blue, superior-orange, lateral-yellow, medial-red, inferior-green, and deep-black. Serial sections reveal a 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm well-defined, tan-pink, gritty mass with focal congestion. The mass comes to within 0.5 cm of the closest margin (anterior). On sectioning through the mass a 0.4 cm red-brown biopsy cavity is identified, with~an embedded metallic clip. The remainder of the specimen is predominantly composed of lobulated, yellow-tan adipose tissue admixed with. approximately 20% fibrous tissue. No additional lesions are identified. Representative sections are submitted.. Cassette Summary: A1-A2- anterior margin; A3-A4- mass; A5-A6- mass with cavity; A7- mass; A8- adjacent normal; A9- section with medial (red inked) tissue edge adjacent to sections from A1-A6; A10- adjacent section of medial-posterior (red and black inked) tissue edges; A11-A12- sections of white fibrous area with lateral (yellow inked) tissue edge in plane immediately next to plane of sections A1-Al0; Al3- sections of anterior (blue inked) tissue edge adjacent to tumor area taken from A7; Al4- medial-anterior (red and blue inked) tissue edges taken from area adjacent to A7. **Matched sections of A3, A5-A8 are submitted in OcT for CBcp Protocol* Page 2 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974

FOR OFFICIAL USX ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974S SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued) : B: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "Level 1 and 2 Axillary Lymph Node" is a 10.0 x 7.5 x 2.0 cm. and irregular portion of soft tissue. Sectioning reveals multiple pink-red to pink-tan lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.7 cm in greatest dimension to. 3.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. Sectioning through the larger lymph nodes reveals a. markedly congested cut surface. The iymph nodes are submitted entirely as follows: Cassette Summary: B1-B2- one lymph node; B3-B4- one lymph node; B5- one lymph node, bisected; B6- one lymph node; B7- four lymph nodes; B8- one. lymph node; B9- one lymph node, bisected; B10- one lymph node, bisected; Bi1- one lymph node; B12- one lymph node, bisected; B13- two lymph nodes bisected (one inked green); B14-21: additional lymph node candidates. **Matched sections of B1, B3,B6,B8 are submitted in ocr for CBcp Protocol.
