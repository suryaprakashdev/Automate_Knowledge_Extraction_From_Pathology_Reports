SPECIMENS: A. RECTUM, SIGMOID COLON AND ANUS B. COLON SPECIMEN(S): A. RECTUM, SIGMOID COLON AND ANUS B. COLON GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RECTUM, SIGMOID COLON AND ANUS Received fresh and labeled with the patient's name "A - rectum, sigmoid colon and anus", is a closed segment of colon including anus and rectum measuring 32.0 cm in length with the proximal circumference of 4.6 and distal of 7.1 cm. The serosa is unremarkable. There is a fungating polypoid mass with serpentine borders measuring 2.3 cm in length with a width of 2.4 cm located 0.5 cm from the dentate line and 4.9 cm from the anal resection margin. The epicenter of the tumor is 1.8 cm from the dentate line. It is approximately 24.0 cm from the proximal margin. In the lower portion of the rectum are additional polyps ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. In the mid portion of the specimen are polyps ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 and in the proximal region diverticuli are seen. Sections of mass and normal appearing mucosa are submitted for procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1: Proximal margin A2: Distal margin A3-A6: Sections of mass and deep margin A7: Polyps proximal to mass A8-A9: Polyps from mid portion of specimen to proximal region A10: Diverticula A11: Normal appearing mucosa A12: Proximal, 5 possible lymph nodes A13: Proximal, 1 bisected lymph node A14-A17: Distal, 6 possible lymph nodes each A18-A21: Distal, 2 bisected lymph nodes each B. COLON Received fresh and labeled with the patient's name "B - colon", is a closed segment of colon including terminal ileum, cecum, and right colon measuring approximately 60.0 cm in length. The serosa is unremarkable. There is attached vermiform appendix measuring 8.2 cm in length with a diameter of 0.9 cm. The specimen is opened and the portion of terminal ileum is 6.9 cm in length with an internal circumference of 3.9 cm. Within the cecum is a firm indurated polypoid lesion with serpentine borders measuring 5.8 x 5.2 x approximately 0.9 cm in depth. It is located adjacent to the ileocecal valve and 6.5 cm from the proximal margin. It extends through the muscularis propria and areas of necrosis and hemorrhage are seen. Throughout the colon there are polyps ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 cm. Within the distal portion of the specimen there are diverticuli. Sections of mass and normal mucosa are procured. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1: Proximal margin B2: Distal margin B3-B8: Sections of mass.  B9: Polyps proximal to mass. B10-B11: Polyps distal to mass B12: Diverticuli B13: Normal appearing mucosa and appendix B14-B17: proximal, 6 possible lymph nodes each B18: proximal, 1 lymph node B19-B23: proximal, 2 bisected possible lymph nodes each B24-B30: distal, 6 possible lymph nodes each B31-B32: distal, 1 possible lymph node each DIAGNOSIS: A. ANUS, RECTUM, SIGMOID, RESECTION: - INVASIVE, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED, ADENOCARCINOMA, INVOLVING MUSCULARIS PROPRIA, PRESENT 1.8 CM FROM THE DENTATE LINE, MEASURING 2.4 CM  SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO FOURTEEN OF FORTY-THREE LYMPH NODES (14/43) LARGEST MEASURING 0.5 CM WITH EXTRANODAL

The use. of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (ASR). These tests were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the Department of Pathology Laboratory at. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. INTERPRETATION: No abnormalities in mismatch repair protein expression identified. Expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 in the tumor was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Peritumoral lymphocytes and normal glands serve as internal positive controls expressing MLH1,. MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Testing for Microsatellite Instability has been ordered. The results will be issued in a separate report..
