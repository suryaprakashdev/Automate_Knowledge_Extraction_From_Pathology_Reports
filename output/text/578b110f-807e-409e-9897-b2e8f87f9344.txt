Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Comment: The touch preparation of the sentinel lymph node biopsy was review and no evidence of metastatic carcinoma is identified. Additional pathologic findings: Usual ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell change and apocrine metaplasia. Signed by Source of Specimen: A. Sentinel lymph node;right sentinel node axillary B. Breast,right breast. C. Breast:left breast. Clinical History/Operative Dx: Right/left breast cancer. Intraoperative Diagnosis: A. Right sentinel node axillary 1: No tumor cells identified. (Dr. I. The intraoperative. interpretation(s) was/were performed and rendered at Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled right sentinel node axillary and is received without fixative. It consists of two lymph nodes measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm and 1.5 x u.s x 0.4 cm. Both nodes are serially sectioned and touch imprints are obtained. The larger node is submitted for permanent section in cassettes A1-A2. The smaller node is submitted for permanent section in cassette A3. Case #: Page 3 Printed: Tnis report continues...

Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT B. The specimen is labeled right breast tissue and is received without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy specimen which weighs 381 grams. A black suture at one end of the skin ellipse marks medial. With this orientation, the specimen measures 16 cm from medial to lateral, 11 cm from superior to inferior, and 4 cm from anterior to posterior. There is an overlying ellipse of tan skin measuring 11.8 x 7 cm. The areola measures 3.3 cm and the nipple appears slightly inverted. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists variably of smooth facial appearing tissue and lobulated fatty tissue, is inked black. The breast is serially sectioned along the superior-inferior axis resulting in fifteen slabs. Slab #1 is most medial.. In the central portion of the excision, in slabs 6-9, there is a stellate hard, gritty neoplasm (tumor #1) which overall measures 4 cm from medial to lateral, 1.2 cm from superior to inferior, and 1 cm from anterior to posterior. This neoplasm is 1.5 cm from the closest skin. It is 2 cm from the closest anterior-superior margin and is greater than 4 cm from all other margins. Representative sections of the medial portion of the tissue are obtained for research purposes and the biopsy site clip is identified within the neoplasm in siab 7. Slab 10 (intervening tissue between tumor #1 and tumors #2 and #3) consists of palpably unremarkable fibrofatty tissue In slab 11, 1 cm lateral to the tumor #1, there is chalky yellow discoloration and slight retraction of the ribrofatty tissue suggestive of two small deposits of neoplastic tissue. The larger of these (tumor #2) is 8 cm Iateral to the nipple. It measures 1.4 x 1 x 0.6 cm and is greater than 2 cm from the anterior-superior. anterior-inferior, and posterior margins. It is 2.3 cm from the closest lateral mmargin and widely free of the medial margin. The smaller tumor deposit (tumor #3) measures 0.5 cm and is 0.8 cm superior of the larger deposit in slab 11. It is 2 cm from the closest anterior-superior margin and greater than 2 cm from all other margins. No other palpable lesions are identified. No lymph nodes are identified within the lateral portion of the excision. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: B1) nipple and tissue just deep to nipple B2) medial edge of tumor #1 from slab 6, 83) anterior-superior margin (tumor #1), slab 6. B4) central sections of tumor #1 from slab 7 (biopsy site clip here),.

B12) representative lower inner quadrant (slabs 3, 4, 5), B13) representative lower outer quadrant (slabs 9 and 10). C. The specimen is labeled left breast tissue and is received in formalin. It consists of a mastectomy specimen weighing 341 grams. A black suture at one end of the skin ellipse marks medial. With this Page 4 Case #. Printed: This report continues... (FINAL).

Patiant. Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT orientation, the specimen measures 15.5 cm fron medial to lateral, 11 cm from superior to inferior, and 5.5 cm from superficial to deep. There is an overlying broad ellipse of tan skin which measures 12 x 7 cm. In the lateral skin, there is a 0.4 cm violaceous skin lesion. Centrally, there is a well-delineated 4 cm areola and a flat to slightly retracted appearing 1 cm nipple. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of lobulated fatty tissue, with central fascial appearing tissue, is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal lobulated fatty tissue and scattered tan-white fibrous parenchyma which is most prominent centrally. The fibrous parenchyma is focally finely nodular to palpation but there are no discrete areas suggestive of invasive neoplasm. There are scattered small fluid-filled cysts within the fibrous parenchyma. No lymph nodes are identified within the lateral portion of the excision. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: C1) nipple and tissue just deep to nipple, C2) lateral skin lesion. C3) representative upper inner quadrant,. C4) representative lower inner quadrant,. C5) representative upper outer quadrant,. C6) representative lower outer quadrant, C7-C8) sections of central breast including central deep margin Microscopic Description:. A.
