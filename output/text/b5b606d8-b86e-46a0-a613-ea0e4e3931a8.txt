BREAST, RIGHT, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), CRIBRIFORM TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE 2, WITH NECROSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS. - DCIS IS PRESENT AT THE MEDIAL MARGIN, IS WITHIN O.1 CM OF THE POSTERIOR AND SUPERIOR MARGINS, AND IS WITHIN 0.2 CM OF THE ANTERIOR MARGIN. - ATYPICAL INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMAS, 0.1 CM FROM THE MEDIAL MARGIN. - COMPLEX SCLEROSING LESION WITH EXTENSIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMAE IN SITU (LCIS), INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMAS, SCLEROSING ADENOSIS, APOCRINE METAPLASIA, AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS. NOTE: DCIS is present in 3 of 10 slides. On a single slide, DCiS measures 0.8 cm. Immunostains were performed with appropriate positive and negative controls. SMMHC, p63, and calponin are positive,. showing no evidence of invasive carcinoma. B.

C. ADDITIONAL AXILLARY TISSUE, LEFT, EXCISION: - METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN ONE LYMPH NODE AND TUMOR  IN FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE (1/1). NOTE: There is a 0.4 cm focus of invasive carcinoma in the fibroadipose tissue with no definite iymph. node adjacent to the focus and no breast parenchyma present. This focus is best interpreted as. extranodal extension.

TSS DCIS Type:  Cribriform DCIS Size (pure DCIS only): 0.8cm Nuclear grade: Intermediate Necrosis: Present Location of CA++: DCIS Benign epithelium ER/PR/HER2 Results ER: Positive PR: Positive Performed on Case: Pathological staging (pTN): pT is N X Pathological staging is based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimens Involved SpecimenS: A: EXCISION RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: A2 ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 PR: Positive COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.. Immunohistochemistry was oerformed usina the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR ) following the manufacturer s instructions. This. 136, 1:100) provided by assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance..

EXCISION RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast needle localization" is an oriented (short stitch-superior, long stitch-lateral, double stitch-deep), 35 g, 5.5 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm needle Iocalized lumpectomy with radiographs. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral- red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing a 1.7 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm gritty, lobulated white tumor that is closest to the anterior margin at 0.1 cm. A clip is identified in slice 2. No additional lesions are noted. Representatively submitted: A1-medial margin A2-slice 2, superior margin A3-4-slice 2, anterior/posterior margins to tumor. A5-A8-slice 3, full cross-section/tumor A9-slice 4, additional deep margin to firmer fibrous tissue A10-lateral margin B. LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTSE Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast and axillary contents" is an oriented 1150 g, 26 x 21 x 4 cm mastectomy with a 15 x 7 cm skin ellipse and 1.5 cm in diameter inverted nipple. There is also 15 x 11 cm attached axillary tissue. Ink code: Posterior-black, anterior superior-blue, anterior inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned into 12 slices from medial to Iateral with nipple in slices 5/6 revealing a retroareolar, 3.3 x 3 x 2.7 cm infiltrative, gritty indurated, Iobulated tan to white tumor in slices 5 and 6, closest to the anterior margin (areolar skin) at 0.5 cm. No additional lesions are identified. There are 24 possible lymph nodes identified, ranging from 0.2 cm to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. Representatively submitted: B1-deep margin closest to tumor, slice 5 B2-B3-entire nipple, slices5-6  B4-tumor to closest anterior (skin) margin, slice 6.
