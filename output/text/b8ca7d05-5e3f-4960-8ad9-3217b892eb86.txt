Patient: Case # FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Breast Invasive Tumor Staging Information (AJCC Cancer Staging Handbook, 7th Ed, and CAP protocol, Oct 2009) This staging also incorporates: Previous biopsy: Breast profile: Total breast with axillary sentinel lymph nodes. Specimen type: Specimen procedure: Mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsies. Lymph node sampling:. Axillary lymph nodes (6 nodes in 4 specimens) Specimen integrity: Single intact specimen. Specimen laterality: Right. Specimen size: 21 x 15.5 x 4 cm. INVASIVE TUMOR FEATURES: Invasive tumor size: 18 mm. Invasive tumor site: Lower inner quadrant (3:30 aspect) Invasive tumor focality: Single focus of invasive carcinoma. Histologic type: Invasive ductal carcinoma. Total Nottingham Grade:. 2 of 3. 3 of 3. Tubule formation: 2 of 3. Nuclear Pleomorphism: 1 of 3. Mitotic count for Nottingham: Mitotic count: Three mitoses in ten high power fields. Lymphatic invasion: Not identified. MARGIN STATUS FOR INVASIVE COMPONENT: Negative (RO). 15 mm. Distance of tumor from margins: Closest margin: Anterior-medial-inferior (anterior margin overlying LIQ tumor) Other margins: Invasive carcinoma is at least 40 mm from all other margins. IN-SITU CARCINOMA (DCIS) FEATURES: DCIS extent: DCIS present in association with invasive carcinoma, and extends into surrounding tissue (DCIS is associated with calcifications, and therefore may correspond to area of mammographically detected calcifications) Pattern: Solid and cribriform. Nuclear grade: Intermediate grade.
