COMMENT : In specimen "e" the frozen section diagnosis of metastic carcinoma is. confirmed on the permanent sections. ** Report Electronically Sianed Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: year old white female with history of left breast cancer. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: SPECIMEN TYPE:LYMPH NODE (SPECIMEN "E"). TIME RECEIVED: TIME REPORTED: REPORTED TO: REPORTED BY # BLOCKS: AND 1 # SCRAPE PREPS:1 FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received in fresh labeled with the patient's name. labeled "RIGHT BREAST SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR, LONG STITCH LATERAL" COnSiStS of a 927 gram mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior and long iateral. The specimen measures 24 cm medial to lateral, 19 cm superior to inferior, and 5 cm anterior to posterior. The lightly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 17 x 11.5 cm and~displays a 1.0 cm centrally located everted nipple. No discharge or scar is noted.. The deep margin is inked in black. Serial sections reveal lobulated yellow. tan adipose tissue admixed with 10% moderately dense tan white fibrous tissue. The fibrous tissue is predominantly centrally located and shows. catted blue grey cysts measuring up to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension.

No lymph nodes are identified.. Cassette summary: Al: skin A2: central A3: upper outer quadrant A4: lower outer quadrant A5: lower inner quadrant A6: upper inner quadrant. A7: upper outer quadrant. A8: lower outer quadrant A9: lower inner quadrant. A10: upper inner quadrant. All: representative section of nipple.. Matched sections of A1-A6 are submitted in ocr for cBcp protocol.. B. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name. designated "LEFT BREAST SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR, LONG LATERAL" is a 954 gram mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior and long lateral. The specimen measures 24 cm medial to lateral, 18 cm superior to inferior, and 6 cm anterior to posterior. The lightly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 19 x 12.5 cm and displays a medially located 1.5 cm everted nipple free of discharge. No scar is noted. The deep margin is inked black and the superficial lower outer quadrant is inked blue. Serial sections reveal 3.5 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm well defined lobulated pink white indurated mass with focal hemorrhage. The mass is located within the lower outer quadrant and comes within 3.5 cm of the deep margin and 0.4 cm' of"the inked superficial surface. The remainder of the specimen is composed of approximately 50% dense tan white fibrous. tissue which is diffusely nodular and focally cystic. The admixed adipose tissue is unremarkable. No additional masses are identified. No lymph nodes identified. Cassette summary:. B1: skin B2: lower outer quadrant mass B3: lower outer quadrant B4: upper outer quadrant B5: upper inner quadrant B6: lower inner quadrant B7: representative section of closest deep margin.
