E:  Sections show an invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma infiltrating into the. deep layer of the muscularis propria, but not through it (E34). Multi foci of. high grade urothelial carcinoma in situ are identified (E2, 6, 8). There are. suggestive of lymphovascular invasions noted. All the surgical margins are free of malignancy. No metastatic urothelial carcinoma identified in five perivesical. lymph nodes (0/5) examined. Sections of the uterus show chronic cervicitis with squamous metaplasia, weakly. proliferative endometrium. Bilateral ovaries display physiologic changes and bilateral fallopian tubes are unremarkable.. G-v: See final microscopic-diagnosis..
