Received fresh and placed in formalin the specimen consists of a 2 x 1 x 1 cm lymph node. Specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette D1. E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, 'right breast partial. mastectomy'. Received fresh on a radiographic grid is a 96.5 gm lumpectomy specimen measuring 8.0 cm from medial to lateral, 8.5 cm from superior to inferior and 3.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is oriented with a short suture designating the superior pole and a long suture designating the. Iateral pole. There is a wire entering at the superomedial aspect of the specimen at grid C2. Accompanying the specimen is an x-ray demonstrating a. metallic clip located in grid position D3. The wire terminates in grid position D4. There is a circled mass in grid positions C3-D3, D4. The margins are inked as follows: anterior- black posterior - red superior - blue inferior - green medial - yellow lateral - violet The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 8 slices. There is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm lesion located in slices 5 to 7. It is located 1.6 cm from the black margin, 0.6 cm from the red margin, 1.4 cm from the blue margin and 4.5 cm from the green margin. A metallic clip is identified in slice #5. The wire enters the specimen in slice #6 and terminates in slice #7. Tissue is banked from slices 4 and 6. Lumpectomy is entirely submitted. E1-E5: slice 1, medial margin E4-E10: slice 2 E11-E17: slice 3
