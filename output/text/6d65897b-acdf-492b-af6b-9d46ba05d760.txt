Received in formalin is an irregular tan-gray nodule. measuriny 2.0 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in one cassette. APC. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-gray soft tissue, measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette B/Bpc. Received in formalin is a portion of tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue, measuring 6.8 cm from medial to lateral. 6.7 cm fron superior to inferior. and 4.8 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is oriented as follows: short stitch - superior: long stitch - lateral. The anterior aspect is covered by skin, neasuring 5.0 x 3.0 x 0.2 cin. Centrally located on the skin surface is the nipple. measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The cut surface of the nipple is tan and unremarkable. The specimen is inked as follows: superior -' blue: inferior - green: medial - red: 1ateral - yellow: anterior - orange: posterior. - black.  Sectioning from medial to lateral reveals a poorly-defined tan-gray.

Not for Permanent Storage in Medical Records / Not Valid for Signing Requested by Patient MRN Date of Service. Performing Facility Ordering Provider. Result Provider Report Name :Surgical Report tumor mass, measuring approximately 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. This area is diffusely covered with blue radiographic dye. The cut surface is firm and gritty. The tumor mass blends into the adjacent thick fibrotic tissue. The tumor comes to within 1.0 cm of the medial margin. 0.2 cm of the lateral margin. 2.0 cm of the superior inargin, 0.7 cm of the inferior margin. 1.5 cm of the skin and nipple, and abuts the posterior margin. The renaining cut surface is composed of approximately 50% adipose tissue and 50% fibrous tissue. A biopsy cavity or metallic clip is not found. Representative sections are sequentially submitted. from nedial to lateral. in six cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - medial margin: cassette 2 - nipple with anterior aspect: cassette 3 - tumor mass with closest posterior margin: cassette 4 - tunor mass with superior margin: cassette 5 - tumor mass with inferior margin: cassette 6 - tumor mass with lateral margin. C. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-yellow fatty tissue. measuring 5 x 4 x 2 cm. Six possible lymph nodes. ranging from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm, are identified. The cut surface of the largest 1ymph node shows foci of tan-gray discoloration. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in four cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - one intact and one bisected lymph node; cassette 2 - one lymph node: cassette 3 - two bisected lymph nodes (one inked black): cassette 4 - largest lynph node. ---= MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: : A & APc. One slide is exanined for each portion of the case. Both slides demonstrate extensive lynph node involvement by poorly differentiated carcinona. Because of the obvious nature of this finding. it will not be necessary to perform a cytokeratin stain. B/BPc. Six slides are examined. Slide 1 show benign breast tissue without evidence of tumor involvement. The red inked medial margin is free of tumor. Slide 2 shows tissue from the region of the nipple. There is patchy ductal hyperplasia and no evidence of Paget's disease is evident. Slide 3 shows extensive infiltrating carcinoma with a pattern most suggestive of lobular carcinoma with periductal targetoid-like areas and nunerous foci of "Indian file" arrangement. On this slide, tunor is present approximately 0.1 mm to the black inked posterior surface. The tumor shows no evidence of tubular formation (tubules = 3). Nuclei exhibit occasional prominent nucleoli and these seem to be multiple in some scattered foci. In the most mitotically active areas of tumor, approximately eighteen to nineteen mitoses are present within ten high power field (mitoses - 2). The Nottingham score of this lesion is therefore 7 (3+3+2). making this a grade Il lesion. Slide 4 shows no evidence of malignancy. Slide 5 shows infiltrating carcinoma with a clear inferior green inked margin. Changes consistent with a prior biopsy site dre also present. No tumor is seen on slide 6. C. Four slides are examined. These show six lymph nodes. Positive lymph.
