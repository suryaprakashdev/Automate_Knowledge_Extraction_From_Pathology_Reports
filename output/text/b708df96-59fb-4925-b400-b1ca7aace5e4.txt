Frozen section diagnosis per 1FA: "Low-grade glioma" Gross Description Two specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. Specimen one is received fresh for frozen section labeled "tumor", and consists of an aggregate of pink-tan soft tissue fragments measuring 1.3 x 1.0 x.0.2 cm. A representative section is submitted for frozen section. After frozen section the specimen is wrapped, transferred and submitted in cassette iFA for permanents.  The remainder of the specimen is submitted in cassette 1A. of pink-tan, irregular soft tissue fragments measuring 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. Submitted entirely in cassette 2A. Microscopic Examination. Performed. The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed on permanent sections. Synoptic Report College of American Pathologists (cAp) Cancer Protocol

ACCESSION Addendum Discussion Fluore rescence in-situ hybridization (Fish) analysis for deletions of 1p and/or 19q are performed on sections from block "2A". Calculated 1p/1q ratio= 0.98 (<0.74 is.deleted) Calculated 19q/i9p ratio = 0.90 (<0.88 is deleted) The results are interpreted as not deleted for both 1p and 19q. A result of a deleted 1p and 19q suggests a favorable prognosis.  A solitary 1p deletion suggests an intermediate prognosis. A 19q solitary deletion may suggest a favorable prognosis in a smaller subset of tumors." The lack of either 1p and/or with decreased disease-free survival and overall survival. There is no change to the original diagnosis..

ACCESSION Addendum Discussion At the request of the clinicians, immunohistochemistry for IDH-1 was performed on this tumor. The tumor is diffusely positive for Idh-i, making it likely that the tumor is mutated for IDh-1. The diagnosis is unchanged. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by The u.s. Food and Drug Administration has not approved or cleared this test; however, FdA clearance or approval is not currently required for clinical diagnosis or patient management decisions.

ACCESSION Addendum Discussion MGMT METHYLATION ASSAY : GENE METHYLATION DETECTED. MGMr Methylation Assay was performed on sections from block "2A" by. The results of this assay are reported below: MGMT Methylation Assay: Result: Gene Methylation detected. Methylation Score: 27.13 --REFERENCE VALUE-- unmethylated <2.00 methylated >=2.00 Background: MGMT [0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase] is a' DNA repair enzyme that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of. Dna crosslinking compounds,. including alkylating agents.  Increased methylation of the Mgmr gene promotor region causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells more. sensitive to DNA damage..  This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and alkylating agents such as temozolomide.  Approximately 40-50% of glioblastomas exhibit MGmr gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that detection of. MGMr promotor methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased. likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide. Methodology:.  DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (Frpe) 'specimens. Molecular analvsis of the MGmr gene is performed by methylation-specific pCR and detected on. The MGmt and beta-Actin copy numbers are used to calculate the ratio of MGmr/beta-Actin x 1ooo. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate,. but as in any laboratory test,. rare diagnostic errors may occur. Resuits of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only.. The performance characteristics of this assay have been determined by The result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established diagnostic product or procedure.
