Surgical Pathology Final Report Labeled "cervical biopsy, frozen section". Received unfixed are multiple. portions of gray to pink-tan soft tissue aggregating to 3.0 x 3.0 x 1.3 cm. Representative sections are submitted for frozen section and resubmitted. for permanent in cassette A1. Additional tissue is submltted for. study 136 per consent from the patlent. The remaining tissue is wrapped and submitted for permanent in cassette A2. Labeled "bladder biopsy'. Recaived is an irregular portion of pink-tan soft tissue admixed with hemorrhagic material aggregating to 0.8 x 0.5 x. 0.2 cm. Tne specimen is wrapped and submitted en toto in cassette 81..

Descriptors For identification of special cases of TNM or pTNM classifications, the "m" suffix and "y,""r," and "a" prefixes are used. Although they do not affect the stage grouping, they indicate cases needing separate analysis.. ! [1 m suffix indicates the presence of multiple primary tumors in a single site and is recorded in parentheses: pT(m)NM. [] y preflx indicates those cases in which classification is performed during or following initial multimodality therapy. The cTNM or pTNM category is identified by a "y prefix. The ycTNM or ypTNM categorizes the extent of tumor actually present at the time of that examination. The "y' categorization is not an estimate of tumor prior to multimodality therapy.. [] r prefix indlcates a recurrent tumor when staged after a disease-free interval, and is identified by the "r" prefix: rTNM. [I a prefix designates the stage determined at autopsy: aTNM. Notes Additional Descriptors Lymphatic Vesse! invasion (L) LO No lymphatic vessel invasion Venous Invasion (V) V0 No venous invasion. Prognostic Indicators (if applicable) Physician's Signature. Date The staff pathologist was present during the formal review and interpretation of all slldes and ancillary studies, (if performed), with the medical student or resident.
