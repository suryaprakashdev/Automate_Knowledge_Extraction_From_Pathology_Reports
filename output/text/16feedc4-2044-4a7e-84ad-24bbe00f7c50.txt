Surgical Pathology TCGA-DZ-6134 REVISED REPORT (Addendum/Procedure included). TISSUE DESCRIPTION: Needle biopsies right (5 cores) and left (5 cores) lobes of the prostate, left kidney (85 grams, 8.3 x 4.6 x 4.2 cm) with 4.7 cm of ureter. DIAGNOSIS : Kidney, left, radical nephrectomy:  Grade 1 (of 4) renal ce1l located in the lower pole.* The tumor is confined to the kidney. The renal vein is grossly free of tumor. The tumor does not involve the collecting system. Coagulative tumor necrosis is absent. Sarcomatoid differentiation is absent. No renal hilar lymph nodes are identified. The adrenal gland is absent. The surgical margins are negative for tumor. The background kidney shows significant chronic changes with marked interstitial fibrosis and tubule atrophy consistent with chronic pyelonephritis. Multiple (4) stones are present within renal cysts (0.2 cm to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension). Case seen in consultation with. Prostate, right, needle biopsies: Adenocarcinoma y(gleason 3 + 3) involving 5% of the specimen.. Prostate, left, needle biopsies: Benign prostatic tissue.. ADDENDUM: The cancer cells in the prostate, right, needle biopsy (A2) are DNA diploid. Proliferation index (mib-I) = 5.569%. This represents an intermediate value (low: 0.0% to <5.0%, intermediate: 5.0% to <10.0%, or high: >/- 10.0%). Intermediate and high Mib-I values are associated with an increased risk of cancer progression following prostatectomy even after adjusting for statistically significant prostate needle biopsy. features PRELIMINARY FROZEN SECTION CONSULTATION: HOLD for permanent sections of the prostate needle biopsies.
