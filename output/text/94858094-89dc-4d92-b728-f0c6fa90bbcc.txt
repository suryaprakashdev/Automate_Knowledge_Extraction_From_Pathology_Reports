Page 2 of 3 Unremarkable Lymph Nodes: Number with metastasis: 0 Total number examined: 12 Tumor deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue: Not Identified Tumor Staging (AJCC 7th Edition): pT2 (Tumor invades muscularis propria) Lymph Node Stage (AJcc 7th Edition): NO (No regional lymph node metastasis) I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. 1.) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left hemicolectomy, extended left stitch marks proximal " and consists of a segment of colon measuring 49 cm in length with a circumference of 4.5 cm at the distal resected margin. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 4 cm in thickness. The specimen i opened to reveal a mass lesion measuring 3.5 cm in length and 2.2 cm in width. The mass is located 36 cm from the proximal margin and 4.3 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the muscularis propria. The depth of invasion is 0.5 cm grossly. The remaining mucosa shows two small polyps measuring 0.3 cm in greatest dimensions located 17 cm proximal to the tumor. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for Tps.
