E. Received in formalin and labeled 3LEFT BREAST / 1 SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR; 1 LONG STITCH LATERAL (FRESH)4 is a lumpectomy specimen oriented with two sutures by surgeon as dictated. Specimen is inked as follows: superior,. blue; inferior, green; deep, black; lateral, orange; medial, red. Specimen. measures from medial to lateral 14.0 cm, superior to inferior 13.0 cm and anterior to posterior 2.2 cm. The specimen weighs 103.0 grams. Sectioning reveals a firm, well defined tan nodule identified with a metallic clip. The nodule measures 2.1 cm medial to lateral, 2.0 cm from superior to inferior and 1.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The closest inked margin is the deep margin,. 0.1 cm. The other margins are as follows: 0.5 cm from superior, 0.5 cm from. inferior, 1.2 cm from lateral, 2.5 cm from medial, 0.1 cm from deep and is covered in the anterior aspect by the overlying skin.
