My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in a total of 10 parts. Part 1 received fresh with the patient's name, initials labeled "soft palate margin" and consists of a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm of pink-. hemorrhagic, soft tissue, entirely submitted following intraoperative consult labeted 1FS. Part 2 received fresh with the patient's name, initials , labeled "posterior tonsillar pillar" consists of two irregular portions of pink- hemorrhagic, soft tissue, 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The soft tlssue is entirely submitted following intraoperative consult labeled 2AFS.. Part 3 received unfixed with the patient's name, initlals labeled "right neck level I" consists of a 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm, 9.0-g light tan submandibular gland, with an attached 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.7 cm of pink and hemorrhaglc fat and soft tissue. The gland on cross- section is grossly unremarkable. A representative section Is submitted labeled 3A. *Two lymph nodes dissected from the attached fat are entirely submitted along with remaining adlpose tlssue labeled 3B and 3C. Part 4 received fresh with the patient's name, initials labeled "superliclal mandible margln" and conslsts of a 2.1 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm of pink and hemorrhagic soft tissue, entirely submitted rollowing intraoperative consult labeled 4AFS.. Part 5 received fresh with the patlent's name, initlals , labeled "right composite resectlon' conslsts of a right composite resection with overall dimensions 8.0 x 5.5 x 4.4 cm. The mandible, 6.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm has hemorrhagic eroslon of the cortlcal bone at the Iateral ramus. The attached soft tlssue consists of buccal mucosa, retromolar trigone and floor of mouth measurlng 7.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm, with an irregular, tumor withIn the posterior oral region measuring 2.1 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm. The lesion comes to wlthin 1.0 cm of the anterlor soft tissue margin, 1.0 cm of the posterior soft tissue margin, 0.6 cm of the lateral soft tissue margin 0.7 cm of the medlal soft tissue resectlon margin and O.5 cm of the deep margin of resectlon. A coronal section exposes tumor eroding the mandbular cortical bone at the medlal aspect, possibly extending to the lateral. cortical surface. The bone resectlon margins are grossly free of tumor. Digital images are taken. Representative tumor and normat tlssue Is submitted for  banking. Ink code: Blue- lateral Black- medial Green- anterlor Yellow- posterlor. Orange- deep The following secllons are submitted: 5A. antetlor mandlbular resectlon shave margin, followlng complex decalclflcation 53. posterior mandibular shave margin, following complex decalclficatlon 5C. anietlor soft tissue shave margin Page 2 of 8

Part 7 received fresh with the patient's name, initials labeled "right retromolar trigone" consists of a 1.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm resection of pink hemorrhagic, soft tissue, entirely submitted following intraoperative consult labeled 7AFS. Part 8 received fresh with the patient's nane, initials labeled "anterior labial margin" consists of a 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm of pink. and hemorrhagic, soft tissue, entirely submitted following intraoperative consult labeled 8AFS.
