Preoperative Diagnosis Pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Intraoperative Consultation. FSA BILE DUCT.PANCREAS,DUODENUM Common bile duct margin tree of invasive carcinoma, focal intraductal papllary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) present (obscuring cavity artifact present) Intradepartmental Consultation: The case was also reviewed by. 4D,who concurs with the above interpretation. FSB ADDITIONAL PANCREATIC MARGIN: No evidence of malignancy. Comment: This frozen section diaanosis/result was communicated to and acknowledged by Dr. in frozen section room a1 MD and i MDhave performed the intraoperative consultations and Issued the above diagnosis. Gross Description The specimen is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled *bile duct, pancreas, 4. duodenum. The specimen consists of a resected portion of the pancreatic head (4.5 x 4 x 3 cm) and attached duodenum (12 cm in length and 6 cm in greatest circumference). The serosal surface of the duodenum is brown-tan and smooth. Upon opening, the lumen contains a moderate amount of viscous bile. The mucosal surface of the duodenum exhibits normal folds with no gross evidence of polyps or nodularity. The pancreatic margin resection is marked with black ink, the portal vein groove i3 marked with blue.  ink and the retroperitoneal surface is marked with green ink. There is no stapied line grossly present. that would indicate the superior mesentery artery. A palpable pancreatic mass is identified. The pancreatic duct is not probe patent and is totally occluded by the presence of the tunor. Serial sectioning into the pancreas reveals a firm, yellow-gray, ill-defined mass 4 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm)which abuts the retroperitoneal surface/uncinate process. Grossly the mass does

appear to involve the common bite duct, which is probe patent and somewhat dilated with an inserted. catheter. Grossly the mass does appear to involve the duodenal wall extending to the mucosal surface and grassly involving the ampulla of Vater. There is a minimal amount of grossly uninvolved pancreatic tissue. A section of the minimal amount of attached adipose tissue isolates 2 moderately firm, round, tan, irregular lymph nodes, which measure 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are isolated adjacent to the pancreas. A representative frozen section is taken and submitted as FSA1. Permanent sections are submitted as: A2: Mirror image of tumor submitted to Tissue Bank. A3: Tangential pancreatic margin attached to specimen. A4: Perpendicular portal vein groove.. A5: Tangential proximal duodenal margin of resection. A6: Tangential distal duodenal margin of resection. A7-A8: Sections of tumor showing relationship ta retroperitoneal surface (green ink).  A9-A10:Tumor showing its relationship to common bile duct and ampulla of Vater. A11: Tumor showing its relationship to duodenum A12: Grossly unremarkable pancreas. A13: Grossly unremarkable duodenal mucosa. A14: One bisected lymph node. A15: One bisected lymph node.. A16-A18 Entire remaining adipose tissue. A representative section of the tumor is submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory.  The specimen is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled *additional pancreatic B. margin.* The specimen consists of a 3 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, firm, gray-yellow, irregular fragment of tissue. The margin is entirely submitted tangentially for frozen section as FsB1. w1/2//y ase is (circle)
