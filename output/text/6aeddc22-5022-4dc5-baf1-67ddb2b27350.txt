Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocyloma: pT3 Tunor extends into major veins or invades the adrenal gland or perinephric lissues. but not beyond Gerota's fascia Comment: This high grade tumor has features seen in both distal nephron (collecting duet) and "typo 2" papillary rena!. carcinoma. It is inunoreaclive for racemase bul nol CK7, CEA or 34BE12..

The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation. labeled "mesentery overlying right anterior kidney lumor' and consists of a 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm fragment ol fally tissue. Entirely submitted for frozen section.. Summary ol sections: FSC -- frozen section control 2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Anterior Gerota's fascia" and consists of a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm portion of fibrofally tissue. Entirely submitiod for frozen soction.. Summary of sections: FSC -- frozen section control 3) Tho specimon is roceived treslt and is rabeled 'right lower pole kidney tunor and perinephric fat. paracaval lymph nodes" It consisls of a 5.8 x 5.5 x 3.2 cm wedge shaped portion of kidney with a suture marking the deep margin. The margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a helerogeneous yellow/tan to white mass with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage  that measures 4.2 x 3.5 x 2.4 cm and locally abuls the inked surgical margin and exlonds into the perinephric fat. All identilied lymph nodes are subnitied. Representatively submitted Portions of the tumor are submitted for TPs and photos are taken.
