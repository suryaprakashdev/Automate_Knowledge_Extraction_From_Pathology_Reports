The above findings were communicated to the clinical team with. GROss DEscRIPTION: Received fresh from the OR are 13 separate specimens, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, and further specified as follows:. 1. "Left adrenal mass" consisting of a yellow encapsulated nodule and associated fat measuring in aggregate 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm and weighing 36.2 grams. The capsule was focally disrupted when received. The specimen is sectioned to reveal golden yellow, nodular cut surface with focal hemorrhage. A representative section from the center of nodule is frozen as "1Fs." Gross pictures are taken. The specimen is inked black and placed into Patient Identification Page 2 of 5

The procurement was performed and documented by on at  Received in Surgical Pathology. is a specimen matching the above description. The specimen is serially sectioned and representative sections are submitted into cassettes labeled #1A-F. Additionally received is a green cassette labeled 1FS", the contents of which are entirely transferred to an orange cassette labeled. 1FS. The remaining. tissue is returned to formalin. 2. "Tumor #1 left kidney" is a portion of kidney, overall 4.8 x 4 x 3.6 cm. It is largely comprised of a red-orange. tumor (4.7 cm in greatest dimension) with a clear margin of kidney parenchyma (0.5 cm in maximum thickness). It is bisected by in the OR, revealing a variegated red-orange friable cut surface with approximately 20% of hemorrhage and necrosis. Gross photographs are taken. Core biopsies are obtained by. for their research. Approximately 35% of what appears to be viable tumor and approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm of normal- appearing kidney parenchyma are procured by in the OR for the lab and documented by. on at The remainder of the specimen is placed into formalin and submitted to. Pathology for permanent processing. Received in Surgical Pathology is a specimen matching the above description. The specimen is oriented with and the portion that she indicates as "surgical margin' is inked in black. Serial sections are taken through this inked margin and are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled #2A-L. A cross section of the tumor surface is submitted in cassette. The remainder of the tissue is returned for formalin. 3. "Tumor #2 left kidney" is a portion of kidney, overall 3.5 x 3 x 3 cm. It is largely comprised of a yellow tumor (3.5 cm in greatest dimension) with a portion in which normal kidney kidney parenchyma covers it. Where the. tumor protrudes, the tissue is inked black. are informed of a gross positive tumor margin by in the OR on  Core biopsies are obtained by. for their research.. The tumor is bisected revealing a yellow soft and slightly myxoid cut surface. Gross photographs are taken. Approximately 35% of the viable-appearing tumor and approximately 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm of normal-appearing kidney parenchyma are procured by and documented by The remainder of the specimen is placed into formalin and submitted to Pathology for permanent. processing. Received in Surgical Pathology is a specimen matching the above description. The specimen is. oriented with the portion inked in black which represents the margin of resection is serially. sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes labeled The remaining tissue is returned to formalin. 4. "Left kidney tumor #3 and #4" is a portion of kidney, overall 5 x 4 x 2.7 cm. It consists of an aggregate of. abutting tumor nodules with a rim of kidney parenchyma. The nodule identified by as nodule #3 (2 cm in greatest dimension) is inked blue by The nodule identified by.. as nodule #4 (2.7 cm in greatest dimension) is inked orange. The surgical margin is identified and inked black. In the OR, of a positive gross margin. Nodule #3 has a viable-appearing homogeneous yellow soft cut surface. Nodule #4 has a mostly friable red-yellow variegated and hemorrhagic, necrotic cut surface. Gross photographs are taken. A portion of the more viable-appearing nodule (nodule #3) is minced and submitted in glutaraldehyde for studies, per request. Core biopsies are obtained by Patient Identification. Page 3 of 5
