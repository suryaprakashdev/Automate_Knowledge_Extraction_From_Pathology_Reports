Clinical History: The patient is a -year-old female with right breast lump undergoing right. breast lumpectomy, right axillary s-node biopsy.On bilateral diagnostic mammography/R UTs-Right revealed a 1.7 cm area of architectural distortion in the mid posterior depth in the right breast with no associated calcifications.Breast MRI on showed a right breast unifocal suspicious abnormality at 5 o'clock that measures 19 x 19 x 14 mm.On right UTS core biopsy at 5 o'clock revealed IDC, with tubular-lobular features, Grade 1 with associated microcalcifications Specimens Received: A: Right axillary sentinel node #1 B: Right axillary sentinel node #2 C:Right breast lumpectomy; lumpectomy Gross Description: The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number..

A. The first container is additionally identified as, 'right axillary s-node -1'.Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is one lymph node measuring 2.0 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm, which is bisected for frozen and diagnosed as, 'one lymph node, no tumor present,' per Dr. Specimen is entirely submitted in A1 FS. B. The second container is additionally identified as, 'right axillary s-node. -2'. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is one lymph node measuring 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm that is frozen and read as, 'one lymph node, no tumor present,' per Dr., The specimen is entirely submitted in B1 FS c. The third container is additionally identified as, 'right breast Iumpectomy'. Received fresh is a 92.6 gm lumpectomy specimen measuring 9.6 cm. from medial to lateral, 7.7 cm from superior to inferior and 2.7 cm from anterior to posterior. A double short suture designates superior, and a double long suture designates lateral. No single short stitch is found although the container label states that there is a single short stitch at the anterior aspect; however there is a portion of skin that designates the anterior aspect that measures 7.5 x 1.5 cm. The margins are inked as follows: anterior-black posterior-red superior - blue inferior- green

medial - yellow lateral-violet The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 17 slices. There is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm firm, white, stellate mass, with a central dark gray-brown area, located in slices 8 through 10 in the anterior/central aspect of the specimen. It is located 1.0 cm from the black margin, 2.2 cm from the red  margin, 2.0 cm from the blue margin and 2.0 cm from the green margin. A metallic clip is identified in slice #10, adjacent to the mass. Superior to the mass and in slices 6 through 11 is a brownish focus consistent with hemorrhage measuring up to 1.0 x 1.0 cm, most prominent in slice 11. Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1: Entire medial margin, serially sectioned C2-C3: Entire lateral margin, serially sectioned C4-c8: Slice #9 including lesion C9-C14 Slice #10 including lesion C15-C18: Slice #8 with some tissue removed for banking C19-C22:Slice#7 c23-c27: Slice #11, with hemorrhagic lesion most prominent in C26 C28-C29: Slice #3, including skin in C29 C30-C33:Slice #15 Tissue fixed for at least 6 hours in 10% NBF and no more than 72 hours.
