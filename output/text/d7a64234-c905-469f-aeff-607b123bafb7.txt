FOR OFFICIAL USX ONLY - PRRSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Specimen #: Patient: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): - FIBROADENOMA (1.2 CM; MICROSCOPIC MEASUREMENT).  USUAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA, MODERATE.  SMALL PERIPHERAL PAPILLOMA. - FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES. Comment: This case is amended  to add the results of immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors, as noted above. No other changes are made. Although eR and pR stains were previously performed on the patient's core biopsy  they were repeated due the greater number of neoplastic cells in the current specimen and due to the focal staining for. progesterone receptors (reportedly 1%) in the prior biopsy.. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods ( estrogen receptor antibody 1D5, progesterone receptor. antibody PgR636). A positive test is defined as easily discernable nuclear staining in 1% or more of the tumor cells. #  Report Electronically Signed Out * CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: Diagnostic -yearoold with left breast mass in I confirmed presence of a 2.2 x mammography and ultrasound on 1.4 cm left upper outer quadrant breast mass.

VOR OPFICIAL USR ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT O SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued) : cm superiorly to inferiorly; and 2.5 cm anterior to posterior. The darkly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 15.5 x 5.5 cm and displays a 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm centrally located, everted nipple, free of discharge. The deep margin is inked black and the superficial margin is inked blue. Serial sections reveal a fairly well defined, firm pink-tan mass in the upper outer quadrant. The mass measures 2.5 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm, comes to within 0.4 cm of the deep margin and abuts the superficial margin. Immediately adjacent to, and continuous with the mass, is a 0.4 cm centrally located, red-brown probable biopsy cavity. A 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm well-circumscribed, rubbery fibrous nodule is noted in the lower mid. breast which is consistent with a fibroadenoma. The remainder of the. specimen is composed of markedly dense tan-white fibrous tissue with. minimal admixed adipose tissue. No additional lesions are identified. The attached axillary tail measures 8.0 x 6.5 x 2.0 cm. Sectioning. reveals 11 lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm in greatest dimension to 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm. On sectioning, the two largest lymph nodes, one of which is tagged with a suture, are tan-white and moderately firm, consistent with involvement by metastatic lesion.. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1- nipple; 2- mass with deep margin; 3- mass with superficial margin; 4- mass with deep margin; 5- mass with superficial margin; 6-7- mass with deep margin; 8-9- mass with superficial margin; 10- mass; 11- biopsy cavity; 12- biopsy cavity; 13- lower mid nodule; 14- uIQ; 15- LIQ; 16-'L0Q; 17; central' (adjacent'to. mass); 18- one lymph node (marked with suture); 19- five lymph nodes; 20- one lymph node; 21- one lymph node, bisected; 22- one lymph node; 23- one lymph node; 24-25- one lymph node, sectioned. Matched sections of 1,5,8-10, 12-18, 20 and 22-24 are submitted in ocr/Paraffin per Time in formalin: >80 hours. Page 3 End of Report. FOR OFFICIAL USB ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF
