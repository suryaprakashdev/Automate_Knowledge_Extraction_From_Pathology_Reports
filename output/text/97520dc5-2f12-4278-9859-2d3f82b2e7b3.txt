TCGA-AL-3473 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Clinical History/Diagnosis: Left renal mass. Source of Specimen(s): 1: Para aortic Lymph Node 2: Kidney resection with Adrenal gland Gross Description: Received in two parts. Source of tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "para-aortic lymph nodes" Gross Description: Received fresh labeled. para-aortic lymph nodes" consists of multiple soft yellow-tan irregular. fibrofatty tissue fragments measuring 5.5 x 4.5 x 2 cm in aggregate. The specimen is sectioned to reveal multiple soft to firm lymph nodes. measuring from 0.3 up to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in 1A-1D. Designation of Sections: 1A one bisected lymph nodes. 1B-1D multiple additional lymph nodes. ** k***************************************** Source of tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "left kidney Gross Description: Received fresh labeled,. left kidney" consists of a kidney with surrounding perinephric fat. weighing 1,080 grams and measuring 22 x 18 x 9.5 cm. The attached ureter. measures 11.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The ureter is sectioned to show a homogeneous, soft tan-pink smooth mucosal lining with. no ulcerations or polyps present. The specimen is bisected to show a 12.5 x 8.5 x 6 cm kidney. A 7.5 x 6.5 x 5 cm ill-defined variegated midpole mass is identified at approximately 0.5 cm from the closest superior pole capsule. The mass also obliterates approximately 90% of the renal pelvis. Representative sections are submitted in 2A-2I. Designation of Sections: 2A ureteral and vascular margins. 2B-2D tumor closest to capsule. 2E-2F tumor with adjacent uninvolved parenchyma 2G-2I tumor with surrounding fat margin inked black. **************************************x******************** Final Diagnosis: 1. Paraaortic lymph nodes, excision: - Thirty-three lymph nodes with no tumor seen, (0/33) 2. Left kidney, nephrectomy:

- Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 2, (7.5 cm), definitive extrarenal extension not seen. - Vascular and ureteral margins with no tumor seen (pT2N0Mx) Procedures/Addenda FC Cytogenetics Solid Tumor. Results-Comments CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS DIAGNOSIS: Left Renal Mass KARYOTYPE: Abnormal mosaic karyotype: 45,X,-Y[3]/45 49,XY,+7[cp5]/46,XY[15] RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after eight and ten days in culture. The chromosomes from 23 metaphases were counted and analyzed. and four of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. Three cells had a modal chromosome number of 45 and were missing the Y chromosome Five cells had a modal chromosome number of 47 and contained an extra copy of chromosome 7. Fifteen cells had a modal chromosome number of 46 and appeared to have a normal karyotype.. Procedures/Addenda Addendum Date Ordered:Addendum Diagnosis The nuclear grade of the tumor is equivalent to Fuhrman grade 3.
