This is a breast The skin measures 24 x 15 cm. The. with an overlying ellipse of white skin and nipple.. skin and nipple are unremarkable. The breast measures 24 x 15 x 4 cm. A suture tags the axillary tail which measures 5 x 3 x 3 cm. The chest wall margin is fatty and. unremarkable. This margin is marked with black ink. The specimen is serially sectioned. The breast tissue is mostly fatty without focal suspicious lesions. A couple of large fatty lymph nodes are found in the axillary tail with the largest one measuring 3 cm in greatest dimension.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 nipple A2-5 - representative breast tissue moving medial to lateral A6 chest wall margin, inked. ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

RUN DATE: PAGE 3 RUN TIME:  RUN USER: SPEC # (Continued) GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued) A7 axillary tail A8 one fatty lymph node A9-11- largest fatty lymph node. Specimen B is received in the fresh state labeled "right modified radical mastectomy". This is a breast with an overlying ellipse of white skin and nipple. The skin ellipse measures 20 x.15 cm. The breast measures 20 x 15 x 4 cm. The axillary tail measures 8 x 8 x 3 cm. The skin and nipple are unremarkable. The chest all margin is fatty without focal lesions.  The chest wall margin is inked black. There is some palpable nodularity along the medial most margin and this margin is inked blue. Serial sections through the breast reveal mostly fatty tissue with irregular areas of white fibrosis. In the central breast roughly 3 cm inferior to the nipple is an ill-defined, indurated area suspicious for tumor and associated with fresh hemorrhage. This area spans approximately 1 cm by palpation and a portion of this area is submitted for tumor banking, handed off to There appears to be a separate tumorous area in the lateral breast roughly 6 cm from the nipple and spanning by palpation roughly 3 cm. Again, this area is visually ill-defined. may be: yet a third ill-defined indurated area in the far lateral breast spanning  There approximately 7 mm.  Several fatty lymph nodes. are identified in the axillary tail. These measure up to 3 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1,2 - nodularity in the medial most breast B3 nipple B4 grossly uninvolved medial breast tissue B5-7 1 cm nodule mid inferior breast B8. hemorrhagic focus mid breast. B9 chest wall margin central breast B10-12- 3 cm area of nodularity lateral breast B13 possible third area of nodularity lateral breast B14,15- one fatty lymph node B16 one fatty lymph node B17,18- one fatty lymph node B19;20-  multiple lymph nodes Note: The specimen margins were grossly uninvolved by tumorous tissue by at least.1 cm along the deep margin.. MECROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:S The slides are examined and evaluated. E-cadherin stain is performed on the left breast tissue in an area showing features of lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia. The E. Cadherin stain is negative confirming this diagnosis. In addition to the histologic sections one of the lymph node from the right modified radical mastectomy is examined with Pankeratin stain. No evidence of metastatic carcinoma is detected either in the histology or the Pankeratin stain. ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **
