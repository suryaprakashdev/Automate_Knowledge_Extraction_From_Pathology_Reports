HTN Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Kidney, left, radical nephrectomy 2: SP: Lymph nodes, para-aortic and preaonic, excision 3: SP: Adrenal and suprahilar lymph nodes, Lelt , resecti DIAGNOSIS: 1.Sp: Kidney, left, radical nophrectomy . Two discrete tumor masses are identified:. a. High grade renal cell carcinoma with extonsive tubular and tubulopapillary architecture, favored to be a tumor of distal nephron origin; sec comment. - The tumor measures 7.1 cm - Local invasion: nol identified - Renal vein invasion: not identified - Surgical margins: free of tumor. - Adrenal gland: not identified (see Part 3). - Lymph nodes: not identified  Non-neoplastic kidney: unremarkable - Pathologic Stage: pT2 (tumor > 7.0 cm in grealost dimension limited to the kidney) Comnent: The tumor demonstrates marked cylologic atypia in the form of nucleo- and nucleolomegaly, as well as focal. desmoplasia. Immunohistochemical stains are positive for CK7 (focal, strong). Racemase (diffuse, strong). c-kit (patchy,  moderale). and CA-IX (focal, weak), while negative for 34BE 12. Although the growth paltern of this tunor is unusual, its. tible with a distal nephron/collecting ducl tumor. This case has been reviewed with th. ich concurs with the diagnosis b. Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell (conventional) typeuhrman nuclear grade II/IV - The iumor measures 2.6 cm - Local invasion: tumor invades through tho renal capsule but is confined within Gerota's fascia. . Renal vein invasion: not identified Surgical margins: free of tumor - Adrenal gland: not identitied (see Part 3). - Lymph nodes: not identified . Non-neoplastic kidney: unremarkable. - Pathologic Stage: pT3 (tumor invades peri-nephrc tissues but not beyond Gerota's fascia ). 2.

No lymph nodes identified.. TATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGHOSIS I$ BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (ANDIOR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWEDAND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Speclal Studies: Result Special Stain Comment RECUT CK7 RACEMASE 34RE12 CA-1X. CD117 NEG CONT IMM RECUT Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received tresh labaled "lell kidney" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric tat weighing 1174 g in total. The entire specimen measures 25 x 13.5 x 7.5 cm. The kidney measures 13.5 x 6 x 5.5 cm. The attached ureter measures 7.5 cm in length and 2.4 cm in diameter.. The attached renal vein measures 0.9 cm in diameter. The. renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. No adrenal gland identified. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to. reveal two masses. The first mass is a well-circumscribed white tan mass arising fron the middle pole of the kidney measuring 7.1 x 7 x 3.2 cm. The mass shows areas of necrosis and hemorhage. The mass is partially encapsulated and is abutting the pelvis. but does nol grossly involve it. The mass appears to bulge into the perirenal fat but appears to be contained within the capsule.. There is no gross extension into the perihilar fat. The second mass is tocated in the lower polo of the kidney, measuring 2.6 x 2 x 1.6 cm, the mass is yellow orange and lobulated, and appears to invade the perirenal fat. Seclions through Ihe remainder of the. kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a well-dofined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures O.7 cm and the calyces appear normal. No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric tat. The specimen is photographed. Representative seclions are submilted for IPS and for permanent sections.. Summary of seclions.. UVM -- ureterat and vessel margins TU--tumor THF-- (umor with hilar fal. THS -- tumor with sinus fat. TK -- tumor with adjacent kidney TP.- tumor to renal pelvis K -- uninvolved kidney  M2 -- representativo seclion of the second mass M2F - second mass wilh perirenal fat ADDm2 - additional second mass with radial margin. 2). The specimen is received in formalin labeled "paraortic and preaortic lymph nodes" and consists of mulliple pinx tan fatty lymph nodes wilh altached falty fibrous tissue ranging from 0.3 cm up to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. Allidentifiod lymph nodes are. submitled. Summary of seclions:. LN1- sectioned largest lymph node BLN-bisecled lymph nodes tN-lymph nodes Page 2 of 3

2). The specimen is received fresh labeled "lelt adrenal and suprahilar lymph nodes'. The specimen consisls of the adrenal gland with surrounding adipose tissue weighing 70 g, and measures 10 x 5 x 3.5 cm. The entire outer surface is inked blue.  The specimen is serially sectioned and shows unremarkable parenchyma, wilh thin yellow orange cortex and brown medulla. No grossly identifiable tesion.
