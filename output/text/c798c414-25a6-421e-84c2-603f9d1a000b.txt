Two short stitches adrenal vein with thrombus coming out of vein. Iwo long inferior aspect of tumor. One long lateral aspect of tumor. Two double long superior aspect of tumor. Inking according to sarcoma template. Yellow anterior, blue superior, green inferior, red medial, orange lateral, black posterior. PROCEDURE: SPGD 1. "Adrenal gland." Received in formalin in a large container is a 1060 gm (15.5 x 14.5 x 13.5 cm) adrenal gland with attached partially disrupted vessel oriented as above. The gland is surrounded by a thin membranous capsule and an 8.0 x 6.0 x 1.3 cm segment of fibroadipose tissue is attached to the inferior surface. The vessel extending from the medial surface is partially disrupted exposing a tunor mass in the vascular lumen. Per the surgeon, this does not represent a real margin as the tumor mass extended upwards towards the atrium. Inking as follows: Yellow anterior, blue superior, green inferior, red medial, orange lateral, black posterior.' Sectioning reveals a tan parenchyma that is focally hemorrhagic and largely necrotic extending the entire dimension of the gland. A central area of yellow discoloration is noted, 3.5 x 1.0 cm, near the center of the specimen. No lymph nodes are present within the attached fibroadipose tissue. 1A-8.
