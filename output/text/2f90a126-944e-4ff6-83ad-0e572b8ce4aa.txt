PATHOLOGIC STAGING EXTENT OF INVASION pT1b. (Tumor more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney) REGIONAL LYMPH NODES pNX. (Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed) DISTANT METASTASIS pMO.(No distant metastasis) PATHOLOGIC STAGE Summary Final TNM: pT1bNXM0 Stage: 1 The pathologic stage presumes no lymph node metastasis. Attending Pathologist: Reviewed by: CLINICAL INFORMATION History of left renal mass SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION SOURCE: Left partial kidney nephrectomy The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled "left partial nephrectomy." It consists of a 49 gram, 4.7 x 4.3 x 4.3 cm rubbery ovoid wedge renal parenchyma. The intact, smooth capsular surface with thin fatty adhesions is inked blue and the predominantly smooth, focally coarse resection margin is inked black. The tissue is serially cross sectioned and the cut surfaces display a 4.3 x 4 x 4 cm tumor bulging the capsule and Iocated less than 0.1 cm from the black inked margin. A representative section of the margin is frozen on one block. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Papillary renal cell carcinoma forming a 4.3 cm greatest dimension tumor, completely excised. Margin is negative for malignancy." is rendered by The cut surfaces of the tumor are yellow, tan, red, variegated and vaguely Iobulated with a thin fibrous capsule. The tumor constitutes at least 90% of the specimen volume. The scant renal parenchyma at the periphery of the margin is grossly unremarkable. Representative sections to include all of the closest black inked renal margin are submitted in nine cassettes as follows: 1 Frozen section residue 2-9. Renal tumor with black inked margin, blue inked capsule and adjacent normal appearing renal parenchyma Note: Representative tissue is banked for possible study. Representative tissue is also apportioned into one vial of RPMl and sent to cytogenetics to hold. This case is accessioned in FileMaker Pro Gross dictation by: MICROSCOPIC The microscopic appearance substantiates the diagnosis. The positive margin is noted on the permanent section. Portions of the specimen not submitted. for frozen section.
