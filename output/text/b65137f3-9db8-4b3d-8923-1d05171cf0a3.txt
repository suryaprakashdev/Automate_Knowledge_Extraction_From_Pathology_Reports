D:  Sections of the bladder show an invasive poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma, grades 3 & 4/4 (D2-7). A focus of in situ carcinoma is seen adjacent to the invasive tumor (D7).  The invasive tumor is characterized by cords, nests and solid sheets of poorly differentiated transitional cells.. The tumor extends through the bladder wali into the surrounding perivesical fat.. The tumor is adjacent to but does not invade the right ureter (Dz). Tumor is present 1 mm from the closest inked radial margin (D4) on the right lateral side.. Lymphovascular space invasion is seen (D5).. Random sections of the bladder outside the diverticulum show no evidence of urothelial dysplasia or neoplasia but do demonstrate the presence of chronic cystitis. Previous biopsy sites are seen in sections taken from between the right ureterovesical junction and diverticulum. Sections of the prostate show unilateral (left) prostatic adenocarcinoma (D23,29), Gleason' s score 6 (3+3). The tumor is characterized by variably sized glandular structures that infiltrate the stroma. The tumor is confined to the prostate with focal involvement of the capsule, without penetration into periprostatic soft tissue.  All margins as well as bilateral seminal vesicles are
