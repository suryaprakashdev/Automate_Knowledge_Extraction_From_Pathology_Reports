TCGA-AK-3427 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Copy To: Clinical History/Diagnosis: ? Renal Cell CA vs. TCC. Left Renal Mass Source of Specimen(s): A: Left kidney, para aortic lymph nodes and left adrenal gland. B: Additional para aortic lymph nodes. C: Left common iliac lymph nodes. Gross Description: Received in three parts. Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, left kidney, para aortic lymph nodes, left adrenal gland Frozen Section Diagnosis: 1FS- ONCOCYTOMA PER. Gross Description: Received fresh is a left kidney with attached perinephric fat weighing 580 grams with an overall measurement of 20 x 13 x 9 cm. In the superior aspect of the perinephric fat is the adrenal gland measuring 3 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm and it is grossly normal appearing. No Iymph nodes are found in the attached fat. At the hilum, there is a 10.5 x 0.5 cm segment of ureter which is opened and is normal appearing. The. vascular margins are free of any lesions or masses. The specimen is bivalved and the kidney itself measures 12.5 x 7.5 x 4.7 cm. In the lower pole of the kidney there is a large round tumor measuring 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm. The lesion pushes on the capsule and grossly approaches the inferior and middle. However, no gross invasion is found. Representative sections of the tumor are submitted for frozen section consultation in 1FS. The second lesion is found in the mid lateral aspect of the kidney and measures 1.4 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm and is orangish-brown in color and soft. This lesion is 2 cm from the above mentioned mass. Further sectioning through the superior pole discloses an ill-defined circumscribed potential lesion that measures 0.8 x 0.8 cm and may represent a third tumor. The superior pole lesion is 5.6 cm from the inferior pole mass. Designation of Sections: 1A- ureter margin, 1B- vascular margin, 1C- adrenal gland, 1D- large mass in relationship to hilum, 1E- large mass in relationship to normal appearing parenchyma, 1F- tumor in relationship to. capsule and fat, 1G-1H- smaller tumor in middle of kidney, 1I-1J- smaller potential lesion superior left kidney, 1K-1L- uninvolved kidney, 1M-1N- perinephric fat Summary of Sections: 1A-1N.

Tissue is procured for cytogenetic studies. ********************************************************************x*** Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, additional para aortic lymph nodes. Gross Description: Received fresh are five fatty lymph nodes measuring from 1 up to 3 cm. Designation of Sections: 2A-2B- four single lymph nodes, 2C- single bisected node. Summary of Sections: *********** ***************************x******** Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, left common iliac lymph nodes Gross Description: Received fresh are three yellow to red firm lymph nodes measuring respectively 1 x 0.8 x 0.8, 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.8 and 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm. Submitted as is in 3A. Designation of Sections: 3A Summary of Sections: *********************************************************************** Final Diagnosis: 1. Left kidney, adrenal gland and para aortic lymph nodes; radical. nephrectomy: - Three tumors confined to the kidney. - Two oncocytomas located at the Iower pole (6.5 cm) and upper pole (0.8 cm). - One chromophobe renal cell carcinoma located in the middle portion (1.4 cm). - Ureteral and vascular resection margins and one lymph node are all negative for tumor (0/1). - Adrenal gland is negative for tumor, see note. 2. Additional para aortic lymph nodes: - No tumor seen in all ten lymph nodes (0/10) 3. Left common iliac Iymph nodes: - No tumor seen in all four lymph nodes (0/4). Note: On immunohistochemical stains the oncocytoma tumor cells are. positive for CD10 (cytoplasmic) and E-cadherin (variable and weak. membranous staining) and are negative for vimentin and cytokeratin CK7. The chromophobe renal cell carcinoma tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin CK7 and E-cadherin (strong membranous), and are negative for

vimentin and CD10. This case was presented at our intradepartmental conference on with agreement in diagnosis. See cytogenetics report. These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the immunohistochemistry laboratory at the r. These tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance ot approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

Procedures/Addenda FC Cytogenetics Tumor Results-Comments CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS KARYOTYPE: Abnormal mosaic karyotype: 44,X,-Y,-1,+7,-14,+20,-21[8]/46,XY[12] RESULTS: The renal mass was sent to a commercial laboratory for cytogenetic analysis. The chromosomes from the cells of nine- and ten-day adherent cultures were counted and analyzed, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by G- banding. Eight cells had a modal chromosome number of 44 and were characterized by the loss of chromosomes Y, 1, 14, and 21 and gain of. chromosomes 7 and 20. Twelve cells had a modal chromosome number of 46 and appeared to have a normal karyotype. Cytogenetic abnormalities involving the numerical loss of chromosomes Y and 1, often without additional changes, have been reported in renal oncocytomas.
