Pre/Post-operative Diagnosis Colon cancer. Gross Anatomic Description Specimens received in five containers. Speclmen A: Designated "right colon distal ileum' is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "right colon distal ileum". Specimen consists of a portion of ileum with attached right colon which measures a total of 35.3 cm in length. The small intestine measures 17.2 cm in length x 3.5 cm in cross sectional diameter. The colon measures 18.1 cm in length and the cross sectional diameter ranges from 5.6 cm distally to 10.2 cm surrounding an enlarged area with focal puckering of the serosal surface. Attached to the colon is a portion of muscle and connective tissue located posteriorly which measures 12.5 x 6.3 x 5.1 cm. The remainder of the serosal surface of both the ileum and right colon are smooth, tan/pink and unremarkable. Attached pericolic fibroadipose tissue Is present. This area of puckering measures 9.5 cm from the colonic resection margin. The area composed of the muscle and connective tissue is inked green. The ileal wall measures 0.2 cm in thickness and the mucosal surface of the ileum with grossly unremarkable. Grossly adjacent to the ileal cecal valve is a Iarge variegated polypoid exophytic pink to green co!ored bosselated mass measuring 9.5 x 8.0 cm and extends to a depth of 8.5 cm. Focally the mass extends to the inked green mmuscle connective tissue resection margin. The remainder of the colonic mucosa is grossly unremarkable and free of additional polyps or diverticuli. The average wall thickness of the colon measures 0.2 cm to 0.3 cm. Gross photographs are taken. Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2 cm up to 3.1 cm in greatest dimension. The appendix is identified upon cross sectloning of the muscle and soft tissue. The appendix is totally encased within the soft tissue making a measurement of length not possible. The cross-sectional dlameter averages 0.6 cm with an intact lumen that is 0.2 cm. The tumor does appear grossly to involve the appendix. Gross photographs are taken. Section code: A1 -- colon resection margin; A2 - ileal resection margin; A3 -- additional representative section of unremarkable colon and ileum; A4-A7 -- representative sections tumor; A8-A10 -- sections of tumor with deepest muscle and soft issue invasion extending to the inked margin; A11 -- three

Specimen B: Designated "inferior margin' is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "inferior margin". Specimen consists of two fragments of soft tan/yellow friable fibroadipose connective tissue measuring 4.4 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm and 3.5 x 3.8 x 1.8 cm.  Each specimen is entirely inked blue. Cut surface of each piece reveals white firm fibrous tissue admixed with tan/yellow fibroadipose tissue. Representative sections ot the heavily fibrous areas are submitted in casettes B1-B8. Section code: B1--B8 -- entire specimen. Specimen C; Designated "posterior margin' is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "posterior margin". Specimen consists ot two smak fragments of soft tan/yellow bosselated fibroadipose connective tissue each measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The specimens are both entirely inked blue and bisected and submitted in one cassette. Section code:  C1 - entire specimen. Specimen D: Designated "lateral margin' is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "lateral margin". Specimen consists of a single portion of soft tan/yellow bosselated fibroadipose connective tissue measuring 2.1 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is entlrely Inked blue. Cut surface reveals predominantly yelow tan bosselated fibroadipose tissue with focal white fibrous streaks. Section code: D1 -- entire specimen bisected. Speclmen E: Designated "superior margin' is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "superior margin'. Specimen consists of two small fragments of soft tan/yellow bosselated fibroadipose connective tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm and 2.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Each specimen is both entirely inked blue and bisected. Cut surface reveals predominantly yellow tan bosselated. fibroadipose tissue with focal white fibrous streaks. Section code:  E1-E2 -- one specimen each, bisected, entire specimen. Pur TSS, Sqanour cU difuntahin L1% OCR hJ 9/g1L3 -.-
