TCGA #:  Sample iD # Diagnosis: This is a (mainly still) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the cecum (developed in a tubulovillous adenoma) with histopathological differentiation grade G 2 with necroses, with tumor infiltration of the wall layers of the colon as far as into the tunica muscularis, with substantial chronic granulating and recidivist peritumoral inflammation with an acute inflammatory phase characterized by partially purulent abscess formation, with inflammatory adhesions between the walls of the cecum and the ascending colon, with inflammatory adhesions between the external surface of the tumor and the associated omental fat tissue (in II), with a chronic inflammation in the pelvic wall (in I), as well as with chronic lymphadenitis in the regional lymph nodes with small focal epithelioid cell reactions and with structured and unstructured giant cells in individual regional lymph nodes (in Il). Furthermore, overview sections taken from the resection margins are tumor-free and there is a chronic recurrent appendicitis and chronic granulating and recurrent periappendicitis (in II). Based on the sections under investigation, the tumor spread of the cecal carcinoma corresponds to a tumor stage of p T 2, p N 0, M X, R 0. 112+ /cs-0-3 adenocavcenoma, Nos 814o/3 Sire: clcum C18.0 3/301 UUID: C5348097-4824-490A-B2FF-F257BDC9C633 TCGA-AA-A01V-01A-PR Redacted
