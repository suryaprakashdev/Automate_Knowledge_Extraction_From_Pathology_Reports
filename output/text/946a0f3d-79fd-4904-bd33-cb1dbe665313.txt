The biopsy has an overlying 8.5 x 2.0 cm black-brown skin ellipse. The ellipse is oriented as anterior. There is a short suture superior and a long suture lateral.  The margins will be inked per orientation as labeled: blue superior. black. inferior. yellow lateral, red medial and green deep or posterior. The biopsy is serially sectioned from lateral to medial to have a 2.4 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm tumor mass. The mass is centrally located within the specimen and is 1.3 cm from the nearest superior margin. is 1.5 cm from inferior. is at least 2.5 cm from deep as well as superficial and is more than.  cm from medial or lateral. The tumor has adjacent minor hemorrhage and fat necrosis. consistent with a previous biopsy. A section of tumor is sampled for tissue banking There is diffuse dense white fibrous tissue surrounding the tumor mass. The white fibrous : tissue has focal fibrocystic changes, and the white fibrous tissue makes up approximately 50% of the biopsy parenchyma. Representative sections are sampled from across the specimen to include tumor to the nearest margins as labeled:. A1 nearest perpendicular sections of lateral margin sampled. A2-A3 sections showing lateral dense white fibrous tissue with fibrocystic. change A4 section of tumor with adjacent petechial homorrhage A5 nearest deep margin. A6 nearest superficial skin margin A7 tumor to nearest inferior margin A8-A9 tumor to nearest superior margin A10 tumor with adjacent fat necrosis and petechial biopsy hemorrhage. A11 near full cross section of tumor sampled A12 perpendicular sections of medial margin sampled ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

RUN DATE: RUN TIME : PAGE 3 Specimen Inquiry RUN USER SPEC #: PATIENT: (Continued) GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued) B. Labeled "sentinel lymph node #1" is a nodular. fatty 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm lymph node.. There is scant yellow adipose on the surface of the node. The node is serially sectioned perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node protocol in cassettes B1-B4. C. Labeled "sentinel lymph node #2" is a nodular. fatty 2.0 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm lymph node.. The fat is trimmed from the node, and the node is 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The node is sectioned perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node protocol in cassettes C1-c2. D. Labeled "sentinel lymph node #3" is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow adipose.. The adipose is sectioned to have three nodular lymph nodes. The nodes are 0.3 cm. 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm and 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. The larger nodes are sectioned perpendicular to the long axis. and the nodes are sntirely submitted for sentinel lymph node protocol separately from smallest to largest in cassettes D1-D3.
