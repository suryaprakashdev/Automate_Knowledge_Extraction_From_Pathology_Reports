Encounter Date: CLINICAL DATA BLADDER CANCER INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULT DIAGNOSISS A. Denuded mucosa. Negative for neoplasm B. Negative for neoplasm. C. Fibrous adhesions, negative for neoplasm D. Negative for neoplasm GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "left distal ureter" is tan-brown soft tissue with a lumen measuring 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. It is totally submitted as FsAl.. B. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "right distal ureter" is tan-brown soft tissue with a lumen measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. It is totally submitted as FsBl.. c. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "right pelvic wall" is one piece of tan-red soft tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. It. is totally submitted for frozen section as Fsci. D. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "urethral margin". is one piece of tan-brown soft tissue with a lumen which measures 0.8 x 0.5. x 0.3 cm. It is totally submitted for frozen section as FsDi. E. Received in formalin labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple fragments of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue aggregating to 7.0 x 5.2 x 3.1 cm. Sectioning reveals multiple ovoid tan firm nodules resembling lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.5 to 4.3 cm. The nodules are submitted as follows: E1 five nodules, E2 two nodules, E3 one nodule, E4 one nodule bisected, E5 one nodule bisected, E6-e7 one nodule sectioned, E8-e10 largest nodule sectioned.. F. Received in formalin is a specimen labeled "bladder and prostate". The specimen consists of a urinary bladder, bilateral ureters, prostate, attached seminal vesicles and vas deferentia. The bladder measures 7.5 x 3.0 x 5.0 cm. The exterior surface is covered by a smooth serosal lining at the dome and fibroadipose tissue at the remaining portion. After the bladder is opened, two exophytic tan-brown fungating masses are identified. The first mass involves the left wall and anterior wall and measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm. The second mass involves the right wall of the bladder and measures 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. Upon sectioning, the first mass on the left side of the bladder grossly appears to invade into the muscular bladder wall but not through the wall. It does not appear to involve the perivesical adipose tissue. The second mass, located on the right side of the bladder, does not grossly invade into the wall. The dome of the bladder and the posterior bladder mucosa are not involved. A segment of right ureter measures 1.7 cm in length, is patent and unremarkable. A segment of. left ureter measuring 2.7 cm in length is patent and grossly unremarkable.. The prostate measures 4.5 cm transversely, 4.0 cm anteroposteriorly, and 3.0 cm craniocaudally. The capsular surface is smooth. The gland is inked Page 3 of 4

Encounter Date: blue on the right and yellow on the left. After fixation, the capsular. surface is retracted and partially detached. The gland is sectioned from apex to base transversely at 3 mm intervals. The cross sections do not reveal a mass. No nodularity is present. The seminal vesicles are unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows: F1 section of urethra, F2 random section of right ureter, F3 random section of left ureter, F4 left wall of bladder with invasive mass, F5 left wall of bladder deep aspect of invasive mass (deep to section F4), F6 anterior bladder with invasive mass, F7-F8 right wall with second mass and deep inked margins, F9 dome, F10 posterior between masses, F1l trigone, F12 prostate right apex, F13 left apex, F14 6 mm right, F15 6 mm left, F16 9 mm right anterior, F17 9 mm left anterior, F18 9 mm right posterior, F19 9 mm left posterior, F20 24 mm right inferior, F21 24 mm left inferior, F22 24 mm right posterior, F23 24 mm left posterior, F24 right seminal vesicle, F25 left seminal. vesicle. The remainder of the prostate is submitted on. per request of as follows: F 26 12 mm right anterior, F27 12 mm left anterior, F28 12 mm right posterior, F29 12 mm left posterior, F30 15 mm anterior right, F31 15 mm anterior left, F32 15 mm posterior right, F33 15 mm. posterior left, F34, 21 mm anterior right, F35 21 mm anterior left, F36 21 mm posterior right, F37 21 mm posterior left. Also, an additional section of left ureter is submitted as F38..
