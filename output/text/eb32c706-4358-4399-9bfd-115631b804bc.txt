Type: Surgical Pathology Specimen Type: Kidney, partial or total resection Procedure Date: Ordering Provider: PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: RIGHT KIDNEY,NEPHRECTOMY (573 gm): RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, chromophobe variant (6.6 cm), Fuhrman nuclear grade 2-3/4 (see NOTE). Tumor is confined to the kidney Resection margins are negative for tumor. Vascular and ureteral margins of resection are negative for tumor. No lymphovascular invasion is seen. Immunohistochemistry performed at emonstrates the following staining profile in tumor cells: Negative-TFE3 AJCC (6th Edition)T1b NX MX Special stains to assess adjacent renal parenchyma will be issued as an addendum.

NOTE:Cytogenetic findings confirm the above diagnosis.See cytogenetics report CLINICAL DATA: History vith multiple sclerosis.Workup for sciatica found large R renal mass. Operation: Hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy Operative Findings: Large right renal mass. Clinical Diagnosis: Renal cell CA mass. TISSUE SUBMITTED: #1 Right kidney GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, labcled with the patient?s name, unit number, and "1.Right kidney", and consists of 573 gm right nephrectomy specimen (16 x 11 x 8 cm),including a kidncy (15 x 7.5 x 6.3 cm) with attached perirenal adipose up to 6.0 cm).A 2.2 cm renal artcry diameter 0.5 cm), a 1.3 cm renal vein (diameter 0.9 cm), and a 8.5 cm ureter (0.5 cm) are present at the hilum and are grossly unremarkable.Gerota's fascia has been previously partially inked black. The specimen contains a well-circumscribed, tan/yellow, hcmorrhagic mass (6.6 x 6.3 x 5.8 cm), which expands to but does not grossly invade the renal capsule at the lower pole, 2.5 cm from the hilar vessels.The perirenal fat over the tumor is freely mobile, without gross evidence of involvement. Representative tumor was taken for cytogenetics,and tumor bank, and representative normal kidney was sent for IF,and tumor bank.

There is no adrenal gland present, and the remaining renal tissue is grossly unremarkable without additional lesions or other abnormalities. The renal pelvis is likewise grossly unremarkable, lined by light tan, trabecular mucosa without abnormality Micro A1:Vascular ureteral margins, 3 frags. Micro A2:Mass and closestinked, adipose tissue margin, 1 frag Micro A3:Mass, 1 frag, Micro A4:Mass and adjaccnt, uninvolved kidney, 2 frags Micro A5:Mass and adjacent renal vein, 1 frag Micro A6:Uninvolved kidney, 1 frag By his/her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a microscopic examination ("gross only" exam if so stated) of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es) related thereto.

RIGHT KIDNEY,NEPHRECTOMY MILD ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS WITH HYALINOSIS (SEE NOTE) Note: The changes seen in the kidney parenchyma are mild and probably age-rclated. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The section examined by light microscopy consists of kidney cortex and medulla There are 269 glomeruli present in the sample, of which 1 (0.4%) is globally obsolescent (sclerosed).The preserved glomeruli show normal cellularity and reveal no significant pathological changes.On PAS and Jones methenamine silver stains, the glomerular basement membrancs appear of normal thickness; "spikes", craters, or double contours are not evident. Tubules and interstitium are well preserved, with no significant tubular atrophy or interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stain (AFOG).Arteries show mild subintimal sclerosis, and arterioles show mild medial sclerosis with focal segmental hyaline degeneration.
