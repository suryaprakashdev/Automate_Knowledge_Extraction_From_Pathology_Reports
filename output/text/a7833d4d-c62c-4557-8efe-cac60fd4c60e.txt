Page 2 of 3 Not Identified Non-Neoplastic Bowel: Unremarkable Appendix: Not identified Lymph Nodea: Number with metastasis: 0 Total number examined: 28 Tunor deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue: Not Identified unor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition): pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tigsues) Lymph Node Stage (Aucc 7th Edition): N0 (No regional lymph node metastasis) 2. OMENTUM; OMENTECTOMY: BENIGN MATURE ADIPOSE TISSUE. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APFROVED THIS REPORT. 1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a segment of terminal ileun, cecum, and ascending colon. The appendix is not grossly identified. The terminal ileum measures 12 cm in length and 4 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 23 in length with a circumference of 7.2 cm at the distal resected margin. The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tigsue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 5.5 cm in thickneas. The specimen is opened to reveal a friable, polypoid mass leaion measuring 5.0 cm in length and 8,0 cm in width. The mass is located in the large intestine, 14 cm from the proximal margin and 20 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning ahows that the tunor grossly invades through the muscularis and involvea the underlying adipose tissue, and 1.5 cm from the ileocecal valve. The depth of invasion is 0.4 cm grossly. The ileocecal valve is granular and markedly edematous. The remaining mucosa is tan-brown with the normal fords. The attached adipose tissue is submitted fox lymph node dissection. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for Tes. Sumary of sections:  - proximal margin shave D - distal margin shave.

It consista of a 24 x. 8.5 x 0.s cm portion of lobulated adipose tisaue consistent with omentum. Serial sectioning reveals a yellow lobulated surface. No lymph nodes are. groasly identified.
