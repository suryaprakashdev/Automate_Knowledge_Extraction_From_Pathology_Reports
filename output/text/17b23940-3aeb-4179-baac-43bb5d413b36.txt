GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Right breast mass #1", received fresh labeled with the patient's name and record number for frozen section is a 4 x 2.9 x 2.2 cm specimen with a 2 x 2 x 1.3 cm tumor. The frozen section remnant is submitted in Al. A2-A4 represent full cross sections of the tumor and adjacent tissue. B. "Right breast, long lateral short superior", received fresh is a right. mastectomy specimen weighing 2040 grams.  The skin ellipse measures 34.5 x 17.5 cm, has a 4 cm areola and a 0.9 cm nipple. A suture marks the lateral. aspect of the specimen. The breast measures 35 x 23 x 6 cm with an 8 x 6.5 x 1 cm axillary tail. In the upper outer quadrant is a recent sutured surgical incision 7 cm. The soft tissue margins are inked blue. Sectioning shows a recent biopsy cavity approximately 5 cm in diameter deep to the suture.. On contiguous with the cavity, the bulk of the tumor is more medial. This is felt to represent a single "dumbell" shaped tumor rather than two separate tumors. Maximal dimensions of this tumor are 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm. This tumor is also located in the upper lateral quadrant and is 2 cm from the deep resection margin. Further firm tissue suspicious for tumor is identified in the lateral. aspect of the biopsy cavity and measures 2 cm. Again this is 2 cm from the deep resection margin. Measuring from the medially located tumor to the lesion present at the lateral aspect of the biopsy cavity the maximum tumor diameter is 7 cm. The axilla is sampled from medial to lateral. BLOCK SUMMARY: B1 - lateral aspect of biopsy cavity. B2 - medial aspect of the biopsy cavity. B3eB4 - tumor in upper outer quadrant B5 - tissue from lower lateral quadrant. B6 - tissue, upper inner quadrant. B7 -- tissue, lower inner quadrant. B8&B9 - nipple B10&B11 - deep margin B12 - one lymph node, serially sectioned. B13 - two lymph nodes, one inked red.. B14 - three node candidates. B15 - one lymph node B16 - highest node (near suture) INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: A. "Right breast mass (AFi)" - infiltrating ductal carcinoma present. (Dr. **REVISED DIAGNOSIS**: This report is being revised to correct the specimen "b" site from "left" to "right" breast. The remainder of the diagnosis is unchanged. A. "RIGHT BREAST MASS", (INCISIONAL BIOPSY): INFILTRATE DUCTAL CARCINOMA WITH PROMINENT CRIBRIFORM PATTERN. TUMOR SIZE; 2 CM. B. "RIGHT BREAST", (MASTECTOMY) : ult for:' I of 2

The on I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es). Date ADDENDUM 1: Tissue was sent to the for assay of the estrogen and progesterone receptors. The estrogen receptor activity was judged to be positive with an estimated rmoL value of 113. The progesterone receptor activity was judged as borderline with an estimated Fmol of value of 14. Please refer to for a complete report.
