NO VASCULAR INVASION IS NOTED. - NO PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIPIED IN A SECTION IMMUNOSTAINED FOR CYTOKERATIN AE1:AE3. - INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS O.6 CM FROM THE NEAREST (DEEP) MARGIN. - NO SKIN INVOLVEMENT BY CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED. THE SKIN SHOWS SCAR. - THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE SHOWS BIOPSY SITE, FIBROADENOMATOID CHANGES AND APOCRINE METAPLASIA. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS WERE PERFORMED ON FORMALIN-PIXED TISSUE WITHS THE FOLLOWING RESULTS FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA (BLOCK 5-5) : ESTROGKN RECKPTOR (6R1I, VENTANA): 95 NUCLEAR STAINING WITH STRONG INTENSITY PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (IE2; VENTANA) : 904 NUCLEAR STAINING WITH STRONG INTENSITY HER2 (HERCEPTEST; DAKO) : NEGATIVE (0) CONTROLS ARE SATISFACTORY. Comment: HercepTesttx (Dako) is an rDA-approved method for assessment of histological evaluation. The Her2 test rasults are reported in accordance. with the Asco/cAp guideline recommandations for HER2 t.sting in breast cancer (J Clin Oncol 2007; 25(1):118-145). Some of the immunohistochemistry and Ish tests were developed and their performance charactaristics were approved by the us Food and Drug Administration. The FDa has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests axe used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is cartified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (cLIa : 88) as qualified to perform high Complexity clinieal laboratory tasting. 6) LYMPH NODE, LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION: - ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE (O/1). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT.
