SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Surgical Pathology Report. Diagnosis: Colon, right, resection. Tumor Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma with prominent mucinous and signet ring cell features; see comment. Histologic Grade: poorly differentiated Tumor Location: ascending colon Depth of Invasion: -Through muscularis propria into the pericolic soft tissue Lymphovascular Invasion: present, extensive Perineural Invasion: not identified Margins: Proximal margin: Negative for malignancy. Distal margin: Negative for malignancy Mesenteric margin: Negative for malignancy. Distance of carcinoma from closest margin (specify): tumor is 2.0 cm from the mesenteric margin. Regional Lymph Nodes: Twelve of fourteen lymph nodes positive for metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 1.0 cm in greatest dimension, extracapsular extension present (12/14). Additional pathologic findings: - Appendix with mucin and tumor cells within periappendiceal soft tissue and extending into muscularis propria of appendix. - Severe acute and chronic serositis with adhesions.. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3 pN2b Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information.. Comment: Immunohistochemical stains for MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 are performed. The tumor demonstrates appropriate nuclear staining for all three markers which is the normal phenotype and which does not support a diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. Microsatellite instability testing will be performed by the Lab and reported separately.. Clinical History: right colon cancer.. Gross Description: Specimen fixation: formalin Parts of bowel received/ Specimen length: colon (17 cm in length, 6.7 cm in circumference); ileum (10.7 cm in length, 3.4 cm in circumference); appendix with a length of 3.5 cm and a diameter of 0.9 cm Orientation: The distal colonic margin is inked black, the ileal margin is inked blue, the surrounding fat over the tumor is inked green. Tumor location: 4.2 cm from blue inked margin and 12.7 cm from black inked margin.

Gross appearance of tumor: Ulcerated, hemorrhagic, firm, tan/white Tumor dimensions: 7.5 cm x 5.5 cm x 5.0 cm. Circumferential growth: 50% of luminal circumference involved Gross depth of invasion: Tumor invades grossly into the fat. There are multiple separate tumor nodules/candidate lymph nodes which are present in the pericolonic fat and measure up to 3.5 cm. Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: no Luminal obstruction: approximately 70% Bowel circumference at tumor site: 4.5 cm Gross distance of tumor from margins: 4.2 cm from the blue inked margin, 12.7 cm from the black inked margin, 2.0 cm from perpendicular soft tissue margin Lymph nodes: per block summary Other remarkable findings: multiple tumor nodules and surrounding fat; The appendix wall is thickened (0.4 cm) and the mucosal surface is tan. The tip of the appendix is dilated with a maximum diameter of 1.1 cm. The internal surface is tan/pink and regular. Tissue submitted for special investigation: yes, to Tissue Procurement Digital photograph taken: not taken Block summary: (Inking scheme: ileal margin=blue, colonic margin=black) A1 - ileal margin, en face (inked blue) A2 - colonic margin, en face (inked black) A3 - soft tissue/vascular margins overlying tumor A4 - representative sections of appendix (cross sections) A5 - representative section of tumor, perpendicular to mucosa.

Grossing Pathologist: Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. For cases in which immunostains are performed, the following applies: Appropriate internal and/or external positive and negative controls have been evaluated. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific reagents (AsR). These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by the. These reagents have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of alified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing..
