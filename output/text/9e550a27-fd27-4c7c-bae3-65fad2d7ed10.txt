The final diagnosis has been communicated via electronic mail to. by Attestation: By this signature, I attest that I have personally formulated the final interpretation expressed in this report and that the above diagnosis is based  upon my examination of the slides and/or other material indicated in this report. ***Electronically Signed Out By*** Interpreted by: Gross Description: A. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "left axillary sentinel lymph node #1 blue" is an irregular portion of red-tan fibroadipose tissue.  The tissue is palpated to reveal one possible lymph node measuring 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes A1FS and A2FS for frozen and permanent diagnosis. B. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "left axillary sentinel lymph node #2 blue" is an irregular portion of red-tan fibroadipose tissue.

The medial margin of the mass is inked orange and the inferior margin of the mass is inked green. A second tan-white stellate mass measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm is located 6.5 cm from the Iateral margin, 13.6 cm from the medial margin, 13.6 cm from the superficial margin, 8.3 cm from the inferior margin, 2.4 cm from the superficial margin/skin and 3.7 cm from the deep margin. The mass is located in the mid outer portion of the specimen at approximately 3:00. The remainder of the breast parenchyma is yellow-white and unremarkable. The specimen contains a tan-brown skin ellipse measuring 7.2 x 4.5 cm. The nipple measures 1.4 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm.  There is no dimpling or skin retraction identified.  The breast is placed in formalin at The specimen is submitted as follows: C1 Lower inner quadrant mass to medial margin.. C2-C4 Remainder of lower inner quadrant mass (to superficial, deep and inferior margin). C5-C6 Second mass to deep margin (bisected).. C7-C8 Second mass to superficial margin/skin (bisected).. C9-C14 Remainder of second mass C15 Representative section from upper inner quadrant. C16 Representative section from lower inner quadrant. C17 Representative section from lower outer quadrant.
