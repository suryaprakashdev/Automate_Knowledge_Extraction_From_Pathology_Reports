PROcEDuRE: Pre-Operative Diagnosis: left renal mass Post-Operative Diagnosis:. left renal mass Operative Findings: large left renal mass. SPECIMENS SUBMITTED: 1. KIDNEY, LEFT GROss DEscRIPTION: One specimen is received fresh with the patient's name, medical record number and further specified as "left kidney". It consists of a radical nephrectomy specimen weighing 323 grams and measuring 16 x 9.5 x 4 cm with surrounding fat. During procurement, a cut is made in the center to reveal a tan- red mass measuring 7 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm occupying the center of the kidney and involving the hilum. Approximately 2.5 x 2 x 2 cm of tumor tissue is procured for.  Approximately 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm of normal tissue is procured for the A 1 x 1 x 1 cm of normal tissue was procured for the. The procurement was performed by In the Gross Room, the specimen matches the above description. The adipose tissue and hilar region is inked in black. The ureter is identified and measures 6 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in diameter. Upon sectioning, it appears that the tumor has invaded the hilum and the perirenal, perihilar fat. Large vessels and ureter appear grossly free of tumor. In the anterior aspect of the kidney, there is an area of adhesion between the capsule and the tumor, suspicious for invasion of perirenal fat. Very small amounts of adrenal tissue measuring 2 x 0.3 cm is identified in the upper pole. Sectioning the tumor appears to have a central necrosis. On further sectioning, it appears that the mass is away from the periphery of the kidney and involves the primary the hilar region. The tumor appears to abut a dilated calyx and the pelvic ureter without invading it. Representative sections are submitted as follow: A vascular margin, B adrenal tissue, C-F tumor and hilar region, G tumor and dilated pelvic region, H kidney with adhesion on capsule L ureter margin  M - O tumor Gross description dictated by No consultants Patient Identification Page 2 of 3
