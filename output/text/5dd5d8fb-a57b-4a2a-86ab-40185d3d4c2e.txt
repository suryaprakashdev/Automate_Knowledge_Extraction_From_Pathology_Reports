Page 2 of 3 Tumor thickness: 0.5 cm Histologic Grade: G1: Well differentiated. Venous/Lymphatic (Large/Small Vessel) Invasion (V/L): Absent. Perineural Invasion: Absent Margins: Margins uninvolved by tumor Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT1: Tumor of lip or oraI cavity 2 cm or less in greatest dimension -pNX: Regional-lymph nodes cannot be assessed for aerodigestive sites pMX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed COMMENT 3. The "tumour" arising on the right tongue shows squamous cell carcinoma in-situ (CIS), at least. Focally the lesion shows ulceration and within this. area there is a focus suspicious for superficial invasion. It appears to be arising in a "field-effect" of abnormal squamous mucosa that shows keratosis  and varies gradually from minimal/mild'atypia to moderate dysplasia. While the  margins are negative for overt dysplasia, they do not appear entirely normal.. ELECTRONICALLY VERIFIED BY CLINICAL HISTORY Oral ca GROSS DESCRIPTION 1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "mediaI margin palate". It consists of 3 bony fragments of tissue measuring 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 to 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto.. 1A medial margin palate 2. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as right partial maxillectomy. It consists of upper right jaw measuring 4.5AP x 1.8 SI x 2ML cm. It includes a portion of maxilla with 2 teeth. There is a tumor arising in the alveolar ridge. The tumor measures 1.3 AP x 0.5 SI x 1.2 ML cm. The tumor is raised and partly hemorrhagic. There is no involvement of bone by the. tumour. The tumor is located at 0.2 cm from the closest medial mucosal margin. Remaining margins are as follows: lateral mucosa margin 0.6cm; 1.5cm from posterior mucosal margin; 0.7cm anterior mucosal margin. The lateral margin is painted with green dye and the medial India ink. Representative sections are submitted. 2A medial mucosal margin 2B lateral mucosal margin 2C anterior mucosal margin

The specimen is Iabeled the patient's name and as "right partial glossectomy stitch anterior margin". It consists of a portion of right ventral tongue. measuring 2.8 SI x 1.1 ML x 3.1 AP cm. There is a suture orientation. There is a superficial ulcerated tumor involving the lateraI surface of the tongue. The tumor measures 0.5 SI x 0.1 ML x 0.6 AP cm. It is located at 1.0 cm from the medial margin, 1 cm from the anterior margin, and 1.5 from the posterior. margin; 1.1 cm from the inferior mucosal margin. The remaining tongue mucosa. shows white plaques at 0.9 cm from the anterior edge of the tumor. These plaques measure 0.6 x 0.2 cm in aggregate.

The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "deep margin. tongue". It consists of a fragment of tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section. 4A deep margin tongue.
