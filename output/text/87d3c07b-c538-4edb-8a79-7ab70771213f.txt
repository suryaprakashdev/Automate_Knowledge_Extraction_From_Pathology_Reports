It also involves the pleura at the diaphragmatic surface and is adherent to the diaphragm. It slightly and focally infiltrate the skeletal muscle. Medially, the pleura is also involved with tumor and it involves the adherent parietal pericardium. The tumor appears solid, made up. of masses of polygonal  cells and spindle cells with desmoplasia and marked chronic inflammation with areas of necrosis. There focal areas of papillary pattern.  The tumor focally infiltrates into the lung parenchyma. ' The. interlobar pleura is also involved and also here the tumor infiltrates into the  The lung parenchyma shows edema, acute and chronic passive. lung parenchyma. congestion,  focal scattered chronic pneumonitis and moderate sclerosis of. vessels. No thrombi are identified in the small and large vessels. Several The lymph nodes are identified and are all negative for metastatic tumor. nodes show sinus histiocytosis, congestion, anthracotic pigmentation and reactive follicular hyperplasia.  The bronchial margin of resection is negative for tumor. Immunostains for the tumor cells are. done on two blocks to include: calretinin-positive: ck5/6-positive; keratin- positive; vimentin-positive; CEA-. negative;  S100-negative, and BER EP4- negative; B72.3- negative; TTF-1-negative. The results of these special stains supports the diagnosis of MESOTHELIOMA.

PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: MESOTHELIOMA POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: SAME CLINICAL DATA: NOT GIVEN GROSS DESCRIPTION: that measures 30.0 x 23.8 x 8.0 cm, overall. The specimen includes the entire left lung and has an attached portion of diaphragm and pericardium. The pericardium is 12.0 x :l.5 cm and has a gray-pink, smooth, glistening surface. The diaphragm is 23.0 x 14.5 x 2.0 cm. The surgical resection margin surrounding the diaphragm and pericardium are inked black. The bronchial margin and vessel margin at the hilum, are taken and upon opening of both the bronchi and vessels, all are unremarkable. Eight (8) hilar lymph nodes are identified, ranging from 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm up to i.4 x 1.2 x'0.5 cm. Upon. dissection, some of the larger lymph nodes have a dark-black to gray, smooth, glistening cut surface.  The parietal pleura is red-pink, smooth and upon. palpation is indurated in some areas. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a gray-white, firm rim of tumor,  extending into the lung parenchyma and involving ranges from 0.6 cm up to 8.5 cm in thickness..  The interlobar fissure is involved and obliterated. The inferior aspect of the Iung is remarkable for a 1.5 cm cavity, containing a clear fluid and is lined by dusky, soft, necrotic material. The uninvolved diaphragm is red and soft. The uninvolved lung parenchyma is red, soft and spongy. Representative sections are submitted in 32 cassettes. Section summary: 1-2 tumor with diaphragm 3- tumor with pericardium 4- tumor with pleura 5- bronchial margin. 6- artery margin 7- vein margin. 3-12 tumor with pericardium (#12 includes diaphragm) 13-17 tumor with diaphragm (#15 includes visceral pleura; 16-17 include cavity) 18- tumor with parietal pleura 19-20 tumor with intralobar fissure 22-24 tumor with lung parenchyma (#22 includes hilar nodes). 25- two lymph nodes 26- two lymph nodes. 27- half of one bisected lymph node 28- other balf of one bisacted lymph node 29-31- one bisected lymph node, each 32- viscera, parietal pleura with tumor and lung parenchyma.. NOTE: Additional sections consisting of the tumor with pleural surface is submitted in cassettes add 1-5. B. Received fresh, labeled level 10 lymph node, is a 1.7 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm red-pink, sott lymph node, which has a scant amount of attached soft tissue. Printed by: Page 3 of 5 Printed on: (Continued)

wThe specimen is bisected to reveal a dark-red, congested cut surface. The lymph node is entirely submitted in 1 cassette.. C. Received fresh, labeled mediastinal fat, is a 4.3 x 3.5 x 1.0 cm soft, lobulated portion of adipose tissue. Dissection reveals six (6) possible lymph nodes, ranging from 0.4 cm up to 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. Two (2) of the lymph nodes are sectioned to raveal purple-pink, smooth and glistening cut surfaces. Lymph nodes are. entirely submitted in 3 cassettes labeled C, as follows: 1- one bisected lymph node. 2- two possible lymph node. 3- three lymph nodes. D. Received fresh, labeled bronchial margin, is a pink-yellow, rubbery tubular structure, consistent with portion of bronchus which is 2.l cm in length and 1.7 cm in diameter. Along one aspect, is a staple line which is 3.0 cm in length. The specimen is trisected and submitted entirely in 3 cassettes labeled D (region adjacent to staples is in cassette #1).. E. Received fresh, labeled thoracoscopy site #1, posterior, is a 7.5 x 2.0 cm tan ellipse of hair-bearing skin, that is excised to a depth ranging from 1.5 The deep margin consists of possible brown-red, skeletal. cm up to'3.0 cm. muscle that is 2.8 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm. The surgical resection margin is inked. black.  The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal lobulated adipose tissue with interspersed gray, fibrous tissue and skeletal muscle at the deep margin. No lesions are identified, grossly. Representative sections submitted in three cassettes labeled E (one full thickness section cut in half in cassette #1-2). F. Received fresh, labeled thoracoscopy site #2, anterior, is a 4.3 x 1.7 cm The brown ellipse of hair-bearing skin, that is excised to a depth of 2.3 cm. skin surface is remarkable for a 1.6 cm possible well-healed scar. The.  The specimen is serially sectioned surgical resection margin is inked black.. to reveal yellow, lobulated, soft cut surfaces with interspersed gray, fibrous tissue.  Representative sections submitted in three cassettes labeled r. G. Received fresh, labeled level 7 lymph node, are four (4) gray-black, soft, irregular lymph nodes, ranging from i.4 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm up to 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm. The lymph nodes are bisected to reveal dark-black, gray, mottled, smooth and glistening cut surfaces. The smaller lymph nodes are entirely submitted and reps of larger lymph node submitted in 5 cassettes labeled G, as follows: 1-3 one bisected lymph node, each 4-5 reps of largest lymph node..
