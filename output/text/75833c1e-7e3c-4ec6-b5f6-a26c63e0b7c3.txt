GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTSE Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "right breast and axillary contents" is an oriented (suture in axilla), 445 g, 26 x 21.5 x 2 cm mastectomy with attached axillary tail and a pale-tan skin ellipse,11 x 4.2 cm, and 1 cm in diameter slightly everted nipple. The areolar skin demonstrates a thickened, slightly puckered appearance. Ink coder Posterior-black, anterior/superior- orange, anterior/inferior-blue. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 9 slices (nipple slice 4) revealing 3 separate masses:. Mass #1) 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm, slices 5-6, central inferior, 6:00, 0.6 cm from the posterior margin and 0.7 cm from the anterior margin Mass #2) 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm, slice 5, central inferior, extending to anterior margin, 3.5 cm from the posterior margin, and 0.4 cm from Mass #1 Mass #3), 2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, slice 7, L0Q, 8:00, 1 cm from anterior margin and 2.1 cm from posterior margin and 4.1 cm from Mass #2

LEVEL 3 RIGHT AXILLARY LYMPH NODES Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "level 3 right axillary lymph. node" is a 2.5 x 2 x 0.4 cm fibroadipose tissue. One lymph node is identified measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted: B1: Lymph node B2: Remainder of the specimen. C. ADDITIONAL RIGHT BREAST TISSUE Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "additional right breast. tissue" is a fragment of pale tan soft tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted, C1.. D. ADDITIONAL RIGHT BREAST TISSUE AND SKIN Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "additional right breast. tissue and skin" is an unoriented, irregular "V" shaped portion of pale tan skin measuring 7 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. The surface of the specimen appears grossly unremarkable. Serially sectioned, representatively submitted, D1.
