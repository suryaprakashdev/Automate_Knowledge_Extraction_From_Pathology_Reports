FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): ** Report Electronically Signed Out **. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: year old female with history of a right breast mass. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 Received fresh is a 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm fatty tissue fragment containing 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm lymph node. Half of the node is submitted for the cBc protocol. The remaining half is submitted for paraffin section in one cassette. B. Received fresh is a 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm fatty tissue fragment containing. a 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm lymph node. Half of the node is submitted for the CBC. protocol. The remaining half is submitted for paraffin sections in a. single cassette. C. Received fresh is a fibrofatty tissue fragment, oriented with sutures (short-superior, long-lateral) measuring 7.5 x 5.5 x 1 cm. A needle. localization wire is in place. The accompanying radiograph is reviewed and. shows a well defined density alongside the locaation wire and about 1 cm from a metallic clip. Inked: blue- superior-anterior, green- inferior-. anterior, black-posterior. The specimen is sectioned from lateral to. medial revealing a 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm tumor with tan gritty cut surface in. the mid portion of the specimen. The tumor is located 0.3 cm from the deep. margin and 0.3 cm from the inferior anterior margin. The remaining tissue is variably fatty and fibrous. Two tissue sections submitted for CBC. protocol with matching paraffin sections as follows:. C1: tumor c2: fibrous area near lateral margin approximately 2 cm from tumor.. Additional sections are submitted as follows: c3-c4: lateral to fibrous area paired cassettes. c5-c6: medial to fibrous area paired cassettes. c7-c8: paired cassettes Page 2 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974S
