LEFT BREAST SKIN E. RIGHT BREAST TISSUE INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: TPA/TPB-SLN #1, #2: Negative for carcinoma Diagnosis called by Dr. to Dr. at (A, B). GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "sentinel LN #1" is a fragment of yellow fibroadipose tissue, 5 x 3 x 1 cm containing a lymph node measuring 2 x 1 x 0.9 cm. The lymph node is sectioned and a touch prep performed; lymph node submitted entirely in A1. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "sentinel LN #2" is a fragment of yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm containing a 1.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm lymph node. It is sectioned, a touch prep is performed, and lymph node is submitted entirely in B1. C. LEFT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast" is an oriented 1408 g, 28 x 20 x 4 cm mastectomy with 17 x 7 cm skin ellipse and a 0.9 cm everted nipple. Ink code: Anterior/superior-blue, anterior/inferior-orange, posterior-black. Specimen is serially sectioned into 12 slices from lateral to medial with nipple in slice 7 revealing a 7.2 x 5.8 x 3.2 cm ill-defined infiltrating mass extending from the 12 to 3 o'clock positions in the upper outer quadrant in slices 3-7 that is closest to the anterior margin at 1.2 cm. In the axillary region is a possible lymph node, 2.3 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. Representatively submitted: C1: slice 2, u0Q lateral to lesion C2-C3: slice 3, UOQ lesion (bisected) C4: slice 4, UOQ superior portion of lesion. C5-C6: slice 4, uOQ lesion (bisected) C7: slice 4, LOQ inferior lesion C8: slice 5, UOQ superior to lesion C9: slice 5. posterior margin (grossly closest deep margin) C10: slice 6, mid section including lesion C11: slice 7, mid section C12: slice 8, medial to lesion C13: slice 9, UIQ C14: slice 11, LiQ C15: slice 2, LOQ C16: slice 1, UOQ C17: possible lymph node C18-C19: skin and nipple (bisected perpendicular sections) D. LEFT BREAST SKIN  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast skin" is an unoriented tan pink skin excision 32 x 1cm excised to a depth ranging from 0.4cm to 1.8cm. The skin surface is grossly unremarkable. Representatively submitted in D1-D2. E. RIGHT BREAST TISSUE  Received in formalin abeled with the patient's identification and "right breast tissue" is a 236g, 27 x 12 x 5.4cm aggregate of fibrofatty tissue with attached unremarkable tan pink skin 10.5 x 4.3cm. The specimen is serially  sectioned to reveal unremarkable breast parenchyma. Representatively submitted in B1-B2. DIAGNOSIS: A. SEnTineL Lymph NOde 1, LEft AXiLLA, BiOpSy: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1).

BREAST, LEFI/SIMPLE MASTECTOMY: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, WITH MUCINOUS FEATURES - INVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES AT LEAST 3 CM. - MARGINS, FREE OF TUMOR. - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), MICROPAPILLARY, PAPILLARY, CRIBRIFORM, AND SOLID TYPES, NUCLEAR GRADE 2, WITH NECROSIS. - SKIN, NIPPLE, AND SKELETAL MUSCLE, NO TUMOR SEEN.  NOTE: The tumor invoives the upper outer quadrant and consists of multiple foci of invasive carcinoma admixed with DCIS.
