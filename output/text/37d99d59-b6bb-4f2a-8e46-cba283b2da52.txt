SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT  NAME: SURG PATH #: MR #: ALT ID #: Comment: INVASIVE CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST Specimen Type: Lumpectomy Laterality: Left Tumor Site: 1:00, 6 cm FTN Histologic Type: Invasive lobular carcinoma Size of Invasive Component: 1.5 cm in greatest dimension in the main lumpectomy. 0.3 cm in greatest dimension in the separately submitted "additional anterior left breast tissue". Tumor Multicentricity: Yes Surgical Margins:  The carcinoma is focally 1.5 mm from the anterior margin and focally 1.75 mm from the inferior margin in the main lumpectomy (Specimen E); ail other margins are greater than 0.2 cm away. In specimen F ("additional anterior left breast tissue") which is unoriented, carcinoma is present at one shave margin/tissue edge while all other margins are 0.2 cm or greater away Histologic Grade (Nottingham Histologic Score): II/II Tubule Formation: 3 Nuclear Grade:  2 Mitotic Count (40x objective): 1 Total Nottingham Score: 6/9 Ductal Carcinoma In-situ (DCiS): Absent Lobular Carcinoma In-situ (LCIS): Present Lymph-Vascular Invasion:  Not identified Perineural Invasion:  Not identified. Tumor Necrosis: Absent Nipple Involvement:  Not applicable Skin Involvement:Not applicable. Lymph Node Sampling:. Sentinel lymph node(s) only Total number of involved nodes/total nodes found: 0/4 Non-neoplastic Breast Tissue: Focal atypical ductal hyperplasia. Fibrosis and prior biopsy site changes. Prognostic markers: Ordered on prior biopsy. See for addendum Time between tumor removal and placement into formalin  1 hour: Yes Fixation Time between 6-48 hours:  Yes Pathologic Staging: pT1c snN0(i-) Primary Tumor (Invasive Carcinoma) (pT) pT1c: Tumor >10 mm but d20 mm in greatest dimension Regional Lymph Nodes (pN) Modifier (required only if applicable) (sn): Only sentinel node(s) evaluated. If 6 or more sentinel nodes and/or nonsentinel nodes are removed, this modifier should not be used. pNO (i-): No regional lymph node metastases histologically, negative IHC Distant Metastasis (M) Not applicable The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, as it reflects only current pathologic data and does not  incorporate full knowledge of the patient's clinical status and/or prior pathology. In Specimen F, immunohistochemical stain for smooth muscle myosin supports the diagnosis. Attestation: By this signature, I attest that I have personally formulated the final interpretation expressed in this report and that the above diagnosis is based upon my examination of the slides and/or other material indicated in this report ***Electronically Signed Out By*** Interpreted by: MR #: Page 2 of 4 Date of Printing:.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT NAME: SURG PATH #: MR #: ALT ID #: Resident Gross Description: A.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name "left female breast sentinel lymph node #1 out at  are two tan-pink lymph nodes measuring 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm and 1.4 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm. The smaller lymph node is inked black. Both lymph nodes are. serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassette A1. B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name "female left breast sentinel lymph node #2 time out " is a 2.3 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm aggregate of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue that is palpated to reveal two possible lymph nodes measuring 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm and 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The smaller lymph node is inked black.  Both lymph nodes are serially sectioned and submitted. entirely in cassette B1. C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "female left breast sentinel lymph node #3 time out. " is a 3.2 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm aggregate of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue that is palpated to reveal two possible lymph nodes measuring 0.5x 0.5 x 0.3 cm and 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The smaller lymph node is inked black. Both lymph nodes are serially sectioned and submitted. entirely in cassette C1. D.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "left female breast sentinel lymph node #4 out at ." is a 2.2 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm aggregate of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue that is palpated to reveal one possible lymph node measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3. cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassette D1. Received fresh labeled with the patient's information and "female left breast lumpectomy' is a 35 gm lumpectomy specimen measuring 7.0 x 5.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen has already been inked by the surgeon as follows:. Orange -- Lateral Yellow-Medial Red -- Superior Blue - Inferior Green -- Anterior Black -- Posterior. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into twelve slices. In slices 6 through 8, there is a 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm firm. white well circumscribed mass that is: 0.1 cm from the anterior margin. 1.8 cm from the posterior margin 1.5 cm from the superior margin. 2.2 cm from the inferior margin. 2.0 cm from the lateral margin. 1.6 cm from the medial margin. The remainder of the breast parenchyma is yellow-white adipose tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows: E1 Slice #1 (lateral margin). E2 Slice #2. E3-4 Slice #3 bisected. E5-7 Slice #4 trisected. E8-9 Slice #5 bisected. E10-12 Slice #6 trisected. E13-14 Slice #7 bisected. E15-17 Slice #8 trisected. E18-20 Slice #9 trisected. E21-22 Slice #10 bisected E23-24 Slice #11 bisected. E25 Slice #12 (medial margin). The specimen was removed from the patient at and placed in formalin at on and not removed from formalin until  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and *additional anterior left breast tissue" is a 2.7 x 1.9 x 1.0 cm piece of yellow lobular adipose tissue. The outer surface is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a yellow homogeneous cut surface with no discrete lesion or abnormalities identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes. MR #: Page 3 of 4 Date of Printing: SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT NAME: SURG PATH #: MR #: ALT ID #: F1-F3.The breast was removed from the patient at , and placed in formalin immediately in the OR and not removed from formalin until On today's date.  If immunohistochemical stains and/or in situ hybridization are cited in this report, the performance characteristics were determined by the. in compliance with CLiA'88 regulations. Some of these tests rely on the use of "analyte specific reagents" and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the FDA. Known  positive and negative control tissues demonstrate appropriate staining.This testing was developed by the. It has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. MR #: Page 4 of 4 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Date of Printing:
