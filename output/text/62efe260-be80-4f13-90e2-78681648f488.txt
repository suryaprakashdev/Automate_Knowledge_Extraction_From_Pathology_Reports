C: Right pelvic lymph nodes D: Bladder/ prostate E: Pre-sacral Iymph nodes F: Right common iliac lymph nodes G: Left distal ureter H: Right distal ureter Gross Description: The specimens are received in eight containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "ieft pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5x5.5x1.5cm yellow lobulated fatty tissue. Multiple lymph nodes are identified, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 5 cm. They are submitted as follows: A1: 5 nodes A2-3: 3 nodes in each cassette A4-6: 1 node, bisected in each cassette A7-9: 1 node, serially sectioned. B. The second container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 3.5 x 2.5x 2.5 cm yellow lobulated fatty tissue. 2 lymph nodes are identified, measuring 3.5x 2.5x 1.5 cm and 3.5x 1.0x 1.0 cm in size. The nodes are submitted as follows: B1-7: bigger node, B8-9: small node C. The third container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5x5.5x1.9 cm yellow  lobulated fatty tissue. Multiple lymph nodes are identified, ranging in size from 0.3cm -6.6cm. They are submitted as follows: C1-4: 2 nodes in each cassette C5-6: 1 node, bisected C7: 1 node, bisected C8-9: 1 node, serially sectioned. C10-11: 1 node, serially sectioned D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "bladder/prostate". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 433.1 gram, 12.5 x 9.5 x 6.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The bladder measures 7.5 x 7 x 6 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2.1 cm and the left 2.0 cm, and both probe patent with resistance. The prostate measures 5.1 x 4.2 x 3.8 cm. The seminal vesicles and vas deferens are severely adhesed to the dome of the bladder. The right seminal vesicle estimates 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm and the length of right vas deferens cannot be determined due to severe adhesions. The left seminal vesicle estimates 4.5 x 2 x 1.4 cm and the left vas deferens 11.5 cm long by 0.2-0.4 cm in diameter. The right half of the prostate and bladder is

--- Page 4 ---
inked blue and the left half is inked black. The prostate is opened anteriorly along the urethra and continued superiorly and laterally through the bladder. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal unremarkable, yellow parenchyma. The bladder is diffusely involved by polypoid (0.1-0.5 cm) lesions, covering 9.0  by 6.5 cm surface area. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion into the adipose tissue to a depth of 2.5 5 cm, abutting the inked margin. Right seminal vesicle is involved by tumor. No normal mucosa is present. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1: Left ureter margin D2: Right ureter margin D3: Urethral margin D4: Prostate apex D5-8: Representative prostate through verumontanum D9-12: Representative prostate above verumontanum D13-14: Right and left Seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia D15-17: Multiple surface polypoid lesions D18-29: Deepest invasion (D18-20: One full thickness section involving seminal vesicle, D21: Tumor involving serosa, D22 and D23: Tumor involving fat, D24-27: One full-thickness section tumor involving fat, D28-29: One full-thickness section tumor involving fat) E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, "pre-sacral lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin are 4 pieces of nodular tissue. 3 of them are submitted in E1, the fourth one is bisected and submitted in E2. Remaining specimen is entirely submitted in E3. F. The sixth container is additionally identified as, "right common ileac". Received fresh and placed in formalin are two nodules, measuring 2cm and 1 cm respectively. The nodes are bisected and submitted in F1 and F2. G. The seventh container is additionally identified as, "left distal ureter, stitch on nonmargin side". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.4cm in length by 1.0 cm internal circumference segment of ureter, which is received opened longitudinally. A stitch is present at one side of the specimen, designating the non-margin side. The margin side is inked blue. The specimen is sectioned longitudinally and entirely submitted in G1. H. The eighth container is additionally identified as, "right distal ureter, stitch on margin side". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.9 cm long by 0.6 cm in diameter segment of ureter, with a stitch designating the marginal side. This side is inked blue. The specimen is opened longitudinally and no
