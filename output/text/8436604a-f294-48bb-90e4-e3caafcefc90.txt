TCGA-B9-5155 Surgical Pathology Report Diagnosis: Kidney, right, nephrectomy Histologic tumor type/subtype: Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma of end stage kidney (renal tumor #2 and a tiny tumor in specimen A13 away from the main tumor mass), papillary adenoma (renal tumor #1), and numerous tiny papillary adenomas. Histologic grade (if applicable): Tumor size (greatest dimension): The clear cell papillary renal cell carcinomas are 2.0 and 0.15 cm, the larger papillary adenoma is 2.0 cm, and the tiny papillary adenomas are 1-2 mm. Extent of tumor invasion: Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: The larger clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma focally extends into perirenal adipose tissue (block A6) Gerota' s fascia: not identified Renal vein: not identified Ureter: not identified Venous (large vessel): not identified Lymphatic (small vessel): not identified Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: free of tumor Gerota' s fascia: free of tumor Renal vein: free of tumor Renal artery: free of tumor Ureter: free of tumor Adrenal gland: not present in specimen Lymph nodes: none present in specimen Other significant findings: The background kidney shows end stage renal disease, with numerous senescent glomeruli, atrophy of tubules, thinning of renal cortex, and arterionephrosclerosis. AJCC Staging: pT3 pNx This staging information is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Clinical History: with renal lesion. Gross Description: Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally labeled "right kidney". Specimen fixation: Formalin Type of specimen: Radical nephrectomy

Side of specimen: Right. Size and weight of specimen: Weight: 850 grams; Dimensions: 23.0 x 11.0 x 8.0 cm; Kidney dimensions: 11.0 x 8.0 x 7.0 cm. No adrenal gland is identified. Orientation: The perinephric adipose tissue is inked green. Presence/absence of adrenal gland: Not grossly identified Tumor description/site: There is a tan/pink well-circumscribed nodule in the inferior pole which distorts the. capsule. This nodule exhibits a central area of hemorrhage and necrosis. 1.5 cm superior to this nodule is a 0.4 cm in greatest dimension satellite lesion which is well-circumscribed tan/pink. Also present in the superior pole 6.5 cm parallel to the initial nodule is a well-circumscribed golden yellow/orange hemorrhagic soft nodule, which also. distorts the capsule. Both of the nodules are present in the renal cortex.. Tumor size: The first tumor is 2.0 x 2.0 x1.5 cm; the second nodule parallel to it is 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.. Presence/absence of multicentricity: Present. One location is 2.5 cm superior to the first nodule, 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: The nodules appear directly below the renal capsule, without definite extension through capsule. Extent of invasion:. Perirenal adipose tissue: Tumor does not grossly involve Gerota' s fascia: Tumor grossly involves Renal vein: Tumor does not grossly involve Ureter: Tumor does not grossly involve Other organs: Tumor does not grossly involve Surgical margins:. Perirenal adipose tissue: Negative, appears to grossly abut Renal vein: Negative. First nodule is 3.0 cm from the renal vein, second is 4.0 cm from renal vein margin. Renal artery: Negative. First nodule is 3.5 cm from the renal artery, second is 5.0 cm from renal artery. Ureter: Negative. First nodule is 3.7 cm from the ureter, second is 5.5 cm from the ureter. Description of kidney away from tumor: The remainder of the kidney parenchyma is atrophic and diffusely cystic with a cortex and medulla that cannot be distinguished. There are multiple tiny white nodules in the renal cortex, ranging from 1-2 mm, away from the dominant tumor nodules.. Lymph nodes (hilar): A 2.3 cm in greatest dimension lymph node candidate is identified. Other significant findings: The renal pelvis is markedly fatty.. Also received in the container is a detached portion of adipose tissue.. Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor and normal submitted to tissue procurement.
