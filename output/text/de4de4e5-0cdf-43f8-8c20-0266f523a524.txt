Squamous mucosa, no tumor present. (M) LEFT UPPER ESOPHAGUS: Squamous mucosa, no tumor present. (N) POSTERIOR CRICOID: Squamous mucosa,no tumor present. (O) RIGHT PARAPHARYNGEAL: INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA, EXTENDING TO INKED TISSUE EDGE (P) RIGHT PARAPHARYNGEAL: Squamous mucosa, negative for tumor. (See comment) (Q) RIGHT SUPERIOR PARAPHARYNGEALSOFT TISSUE: Denuded squamous mucosa with no tumor present. COMMENT The intact tissue sections in part P are negative for invasive tumor. The overall findings favor an interpretation of no tumor present. GROSSDESCRIPTION A) CONTENTS SU3MENTAL TRIANGLE-A portion of yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.1 x 1 cm.Five potential lymph nodes are found, ranging in greatest dimension from 0.3 to 0.6 cm. No tumor is seen grossly. SECTION CODE:A1, five potential lymph nodes;A2, remainder of specimen. (B)CONTENTS RIGHT LEVEL 1-A portion of adipose tissue measuring 4.1 x 3 x 1.5 cm.This measurement includes the salivary gland, which measures 3 x 1 x 1 cm. Three potential lymph nodes are found, ranging in size from 0.5 to 1 cm in greatest dimension. The salivary gland is serially sectioned and appears unremarkable. SECTION CODE: B1, three potential lymph nodes (one bisected.inked in blue); B2, adipose tissue from specimen (all adipose tissue is submitted); B3, representative portion of salivary gland *FS/DX: DETACHED FRAGMENT OF CARCINOMA IN FIBRIN (?CONTAMINANT) (C) COMPOSITE RESECTION,TOTALLARYNGECTOMY,TOTALGLOSSECTOMY-The e ngue8x7x3.5cm and attached larynx with attached first trachea ring (8 x 5 x 4 cm). There is an ulcerated lesion (4 x 3 cm),obliterating the base of the tongue, epiglottis, and pharynx bilaterally. An ill-defined tumor associated with the ulcer invades the base of tongue, hyoid bone, left inferior (ventral) surface of the tongue and soft tissue/ skeletal muscle deep to tongue at the neck. No tumor is identified within the larynx. Thyroid gland is not present. SECTION CODE:C1,C2, midline-tumor with base of tongue;C3,ulcerated region left;C4, ulcerated region right; C5 C6, ulceration with deep skeletal muscle extending to neck/chin region; C7,ulcerated tumor with epiglottis; C8,C9, additional ulceration bed; C10, para- laryngeal soft tissue; C11, left transglottic section:C12, right transglottic section C13, representative section of hyoid bone for decalcification.
