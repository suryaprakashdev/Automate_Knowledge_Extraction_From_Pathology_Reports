SURGICALPATHOLOGY SPECIMEN A. KIDNEY - 1. Left kidney mass (margin measurments) Genome project 1243 p.m. CLINICAL INFORMATION Left kidney mass. GROSS DESCRIPTION The snecimen is received fresh in frozen section room labeled with the patient's name. d additionally labeled "left kidney mass" and consists of a 4.5 x 3.1 x 3 cmT kidney covered by adipose tissue, measuring 7 x 3.5 x 1 cm. There is a 2.4 cm in maximal diameter tan Iobulated mass, which is located 0.5 cm from the surgical margin. The surgical kidney margin is inked black and the renal capsule is inked red. A representative section is submitted for frozen section interpretation The frozen section residual is submitted in cassette (A1). The remainder of the lesion is submitted in cassettes (A2)-(A6).. Frozen section diagnosis: FSA1 -- "Primary renal neoplasm. Margin negative, 0.5 cm from tumor.". MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed. The primary renal neoplasm is a type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma, Fuhrman nuclear grade 3. The tumor is confined to the kidney with a predominately pseudo solid appearance due to compression of papillae and tubules. Aggregates of foamy macrophages and focal areas of papillae with fibrovascular cores and scattered psammoma bodies are present. The tumor has a somewhat biphasic appearance with an admixture of cells with round, more uniform nuclei and scant cytoplasm and cells with enlarged, irregular nuclei with focally prominent nucleoli and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor is 0.55 cm from the kidney margin and does not penetrate the renal capsule. Mild arteriosclerosis is seen in the adjacent uninvolved kidney.
