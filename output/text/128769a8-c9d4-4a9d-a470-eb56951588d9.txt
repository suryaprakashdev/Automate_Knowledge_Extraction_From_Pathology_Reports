Tumor: Normal: Slide: Microscopic Description: Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter. The tumor is composed primarily of cells resembling. fibrillary astrocytes and to a lesser degree, gemistocytic astrocytes. In the much larger specimen 2, gemistocytic astrocytes predominant, whereas fibrillary astrocytes predominate in specimen 1. There is prominent prineuronal satellitosis. Atypia is mild to moderate. Whereas there are generally only rare mitoses, up to three mitoses are seen in 10 high power fields. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis. Addendum Discussion: The calculated MIB-1 labeling index ranges up to 25.5% in the most proliferative regions of tumor. Addendum Diagnosis: Frontal Brain Tumor, Anaplastic Astrocytoma, Gemistocytic (Who Grade III) MIB-1 Labeling Index= 25.2%
