There is a minimal (5%) component of ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade. No angiolymphatic invasion identified. Tumor closely approaches (0.1 cm) the original inferior margin. Skin, nipple, and final surgical margins (after re-excision) are negative for tumor. Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (5) right axillary sentinel lymph nodes are negative for tumor (AJCCpN0(sn)(i-)). Blue dye is identified in all five right axillary sentinel lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression. HER2/neu protein overexpression is negative, score of 1+, according to the interpretation guidelines in the FDA-approved HercepTest. UUID:F4DBFC71-9CD0-41C3-9F20-77FA0605D4A8 Redacted
