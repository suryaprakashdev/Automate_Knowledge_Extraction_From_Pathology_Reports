SPECIMENS: A. LEFT COLON SPECIMEN(S): A. LEFT COLON GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT COLON Received fresh is an unoriented, closed segment of colon measuring 28 cm in length. The external. circumference is 8.2 cm. The serosa has numerous adhesions and a firm nodule measuring 11 x 8.5 x 6 cm. The serosa is inked black. The specimen is opened; there is an annular, indurated, ulcerated mass with serpentine borders measuring 10.7 x 8.5 x 6 cm. It is necrotic and extends through the muscular propria into the mesocolonic fat. It is located 8 and 10 cm from either surgical margin. 2.5 cm from the mass and 7.5 cm from the margin is a pedunculated polyp measuring 4.5 x 3.7 x 3 cm. It has. superficial a depth of invasion. Extending from the sessile polyp to the margin are numerous polyps ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified. A portion of the mass is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1-A2: margins A3-A5: mass including deep margin A6-A7: mesocolonic fat and mass A8: mass and possible diverticula A9-A10: mass in relationship to normal-appearing mucosa A11-A14: mass extending into the mesocolonic fat A15: polyps A16-A17: section of pedunculated polyp en bloc A18: pedunculated polyp and stalk A19: pedunculated polyp A20: normal-appearing mucosa A21-A24: proximal 6 lymph nodes each A25-A27: proximal 4 lymph nodes each A28: proximal 1 matted lymph node A30-A38: distal 6 possible lymph nodes each A39-A40: distal 2 bisected lymph nodes each DIAGNOSIS: A.
