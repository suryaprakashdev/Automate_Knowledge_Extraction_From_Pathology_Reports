Sox/D0 FEMALE Coplus to: Keceived: TISSUE(S) RECEIVED: Left adrenal gland. CLINICAL INFORMATION:S Clinically Cushing's. Left adrenal mass.. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:A Specimen (labelled *left adrenalectomy*) consists of a 45g. ragged and disrupted piece of firm tan tissua 60~x 35 x 40mm, with a non-intact capsule.  Visible from the external surfaca axe multiple nodular protuberans, in addition to orangish/yellow portions of ?residual adrenal tissue. One of the nodules (included in the total measurement) itself measures 26 x 20 x 15mm and attached by thin membranous tissue only to the bulk of the tissue, and has a homogenous tan cut surface.  The main portion of tissue largely comprises a nodule 35 x 35 x 30mm, which has a compressed rim of adrenal tissue at one edge, and has a remaining multinodular appearance with aream specks but predominantly light tan in colour.. (Representative sections: Al&A2 - almost separate nodule; A3-A9 representative large tumour mass; Al0 - more normal appearing adrenal from one. edge of the lesion with adjacent' fibrofatty tissue). Macro Description by: MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sections show a nodular and diffuse adrenocortical tumour. Most of the cells are generally lipid depleted and are arranged in nests, trabeculae and sheets.. There is wide variation in the nuclear size and shape but generally it is moderate with focal areas showing severe pleomorphism (Fuhrman grade 2-3). There are Some cells contain pAs positive diastase resistant globules. Extensive numerous mitoses (up to 12/lohpf) but atypical mitoses are rare.  The nodules are separated by thin and thick. areas of necrosis are present.. fibrous bands.. Tumour cells are seen. The tumour has a disrupted fibrous capsula. infiltrating through tha capsule in focal areas. The painted resection margin. There is evidence of. is focally involved by tumour cells (blocks A4 & A8).* sinusoidal permeation and endothelial lined space permeation (blocks A4 & A8). Occasional microscopic foci of infiltration into fatty tissue are seen. Scanty remmant non-neoplastic adrenal tissue is present at the periphery of the tumour. Fage:1 ...

x/DO FEMALE Coples loc Received: IMMUNOCHEMISTRY: The tumour cells are positive for synaptophysin and melan-A. They are negative for AE1/AE3. They give weak focal staining with cDio.. The staining characters are consistent with adrenocortical tumour. COMMENT: Frequent mitoses with occasional atypical mitoses, nuclear pleomorphism, endothelial lined space permeation and necrosis are supportive of the diaanosis of carcinoma.. Dr has also seen this case and agrees with the above.
