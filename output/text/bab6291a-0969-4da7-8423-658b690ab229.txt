MRN: NoRmAsqqnd Age: Sex: F DOB: Surgical Pathology Histopathological Examination Path# Collected: Received: Supplement :. Pre-Op Diagnosis Cecal  Mass Order Physician. Specimens Colon Segment, Terminal ileum and right colon Frozen Diagnosis : Report : SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT, This supplemental report is issued to report FIsh results Fish analysis is negative for the t(ll;l4) translocation. This finding, in conjunction with the negative immunohistochemical stain for cyclin Dl, excludes mantle cell lymphoma. The FIsh study does show another IGH rearrangement involving an unknown partner chromosome. IGH rearrangements are commonly seen in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The final diagnosis is thus amended as follows: Terminal ileum and right colon, resection: - CD5-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. - Five lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/5).. Intradepartmental consultation obtained. This case was discussed with GROSS EXAMINATION: The specimen is received in formalin in a container labeled with the name of the patient and identified as colon segment, terminal ileum and right colon.. Circumference of Terminal Ileum: Up to 1l cm. Length of Colon: 12 cm Circumference of Colon: Up to 7.5 cm Margins: Stapled closed THIS CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED DOCUMENT/INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAW.

Serosa: Scattered fibrous adhesions Mass: Size: 11.5 x 7 x 2.5 cm Type: Ulcerated and infiltrative. Reqion:. Terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and cecum Distance from Margin: 7 cm, proximal; 8 cm, distal. Circumference: 100% Depth of Invasion: Grossly extends through the wall Distance from Radial Margin: Approximately 1.5 cm Appendix: No Block Summary: Proximal margin l, distal margin 2, radial margin 3, mass 4-1l, uninvolved small bowel i2, uninvolved colon 13, four potential lymph nodes 14. A portion of the mass is submitted for flow studies. Case reviewed with DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Terminal ileum and right colon, resection: - B-cell lymphoma involving full thickness of terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and cecum (see comment). Five lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/5). COMMENT : Sections of the mass show a diffuse infiltrate of medium sized atypical lymphocytes extending from the mucosa to the subserosal adipose tissue. Flow cytometry showed a monoclonal B-cell population positive for cDl9, CD5, bright cD20, Fmc-7, and lambda. As the flow cytometry results were inconclusive, suitable immunohistochemical stains were evaluated to further characterize this lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be positive for BCL-6, CD23, CD5, and PAX5. Cyclin Dl, MUM-l, CD10, CD3, and cD43 are negative.  A MIB-1 proliferative index is approximately 50%. This is a challenging case. The immunoprofile is of a B-cell lymphoma.  The differential diagnosis is between a cD5 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma versus an atypical mantle cell lymphoma. Tissue has been sent for FIsh studies for the t(ll;l4) translocation to help clarify the diagnosis. Results of Fish studies will be reported in an addendum when available.
