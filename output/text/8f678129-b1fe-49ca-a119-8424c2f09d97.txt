DIAGNOSIS (A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND: RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (10.O CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE (70% CLEAR CELLS, 30% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. (SEE COMMENT). Margins of resection free of tumor. Adrenal gland, no tumor present. (B) GONADAL VEIN RIGHT: Blood vessels and fibroadipose tissue, no tumor present. COMMENT The renal cell carcinoma in the right kidney appears to be confined to the kidney and does not invade into the perinephric adipose tissue or the renal vein. The tumor pushes against the renal sinus but there is no unequivocal invasion into the renal sinus adipose tissue. Multiple additional deeper sections were also examined. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A radical nephrectomy specimen (23.0 x 14.0 x 9.5 cm) with a kidney (14.0 x 9.0 x 9.0 cm) and adrenal gland (6.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm). The kidney reveals a 10.0 x 8.5 x 8.5 cm tumor within the upper pole. The tumor is close to the Gerota's fascia and perinephric fat in focal areas (0.6 cm nearest). The tumor is also close to the pelvicalyceal system and the renal sinus. The renal vein and ureter are unremarkable. The tumor reveals overall pale yellow lobular surface with focal areas of hemorrhage, and myxoid degeneration centrally. The rest of the kidney and adrenal gland is unremarkable. Tumor is submitted for the vaccine protocol. INK CODE: Black - Gerota's fascia. SECTION CODE: A1-A3, tumor closest to Gerota's fascia; A4-A9, tumor close to the renal sinus; A10-A14, different areas of the tumor; A15, representative sections of the adrenal gland; A16, representative section from kidney; A17, renal vein and ureter. (B) GONADAL VEIN RIGHT - A single unoriented fragment of tissue measuring approximately 10.0 x 3.0 x 0.3 cm. The vein is identified and shows no evidence of tumor thrombi or other abnormalities. The surrounding soft tissue shows focal hemorrhage but otherwise unremarkable. SECTION CODE: B1-B3, representative sections. CLINICAL HISTORY Right renal mass. SNOMED CODES T-71000, M-83123
