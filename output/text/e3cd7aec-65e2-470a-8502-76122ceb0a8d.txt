WLE RIGHT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast needle localization" is a previously inked 99g, 9 x 8.5 x 3.4cm needle localized lumpectomy with 2 radiographs. Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-  blue, inferior-orange, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 10 slices revealing a 1.7 x 1.6 x 1.5cm tan pink well circumscribed mass at the posterior margin in slices 4-7. A second 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5cm tan pink firm ill defined mass is identified, 0.3cm from the anterior-medial margin in slice 8, 1.9cm from the main mass. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:. A1-A2: lateral margin slice 1 A3: deep margin slice 2  A4-A5: next to mass with deep margin slice 3 A6-A8: deep margin with mass 1 in A6 slice 4 A9-A12: slice 5 with mass in A9 A13-A16: slice 6 with mass in A14-A15 A17: mass with deep margin slice 7 A18: anterior margin slice 7 A19-A21: slice 8 with mass 2 in A21 A22: next to mass 2 slice 9 A23: medial margin slice 10 B. SLN 1 RIGHT AXILLA  Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 1.3 x 1.2 x 1cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and a touch prep is taken. Toto B1. C. SLN 2 RIGHT AXILLA  Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and a touch prep is taken. Toto C1 D. SLN 3 RIGHT AXILLA  Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and a touch prep is. taken. Toto D1. DIAGNOSIS:  A. BREAST, RIGHT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:  : INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 3, MEASURING 1.8-CM  - HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLIDE AND CRIBRIFORM TYPES WITH CENTRAL NECROSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS - INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT 0.15-CM FROM POSTERIOR SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN - BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1). C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1) D. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:E - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).E  NOTE: Two nodules are grossly identified, larger located superior posterior and smaller located inferior anterior and.  more medial. Both tumors have the same histomorphology. The larger nodule extends from slice #4 to slice #7. The smaller nodule is located in slice #8. The tissue in between these two nodules shows DCis. Therefore, given

the presence of DCIS between these two tumors and having the same histomorphology, these tumors are considered connected. The largest confluent tumor size is 1.8-cm.
