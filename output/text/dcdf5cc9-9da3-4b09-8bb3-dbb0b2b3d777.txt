LEFT RENAL FINAL MARGIN D. FINAL RANDOM MARGIN E. FAT OVERLYING KIDNEY-LEFT CLINICAL HISTORY  None given INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS FSC/FSD- Negative for tumor by Dr. to Dr. at GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT RENAL MASS Received fresh is a piece of yellow-tan soft tissue weighing 13 g and measuring 3.7 x 2.8 x 2 cm. There is a suture designating the site of additional tumor resection. The indicated surface is inked blue and the opposite surface is inked black. The specimen is bisected; there is a well-circumscribed gold-tan mass measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm which is located adjacent to the tumor resection margin. The mass is hemorrhagic and necrotic. Portion is submitted for procurement. The adjacent fat is unremarkable.. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassettes A1-A8. B. ADDITIONAL TUMOR-LEFT RENAL Received in formalin is a piece of brown-tan tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. There is a area white-. tan discoloration measuring 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm. The renal tissue is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes B1-B2. C. LEFT RENAL FINAL MARGIN Received fresh are 3 small tan-red tissue fragments measuring 0.6 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSC1. D. FINAL RANDOM MARGIN Received fresh are 4 tan tissue fragments measuring 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSD1.. E. FAT OVERLYING KIDNEY-LEFT Received in formalin is an aggregate of yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring 20 x 14 x 4 cm. On sectioning, no masses, lesions, or areas of discoloration are identified. Representative sections are submitted in cassette E1-E3. DIAGNOSIS: A. KIDNEY, LEFT, PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY: - RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, PAPILLARY TYPE, FUHRMAN GRADE 2 CONFINED TO KIDNEY.
