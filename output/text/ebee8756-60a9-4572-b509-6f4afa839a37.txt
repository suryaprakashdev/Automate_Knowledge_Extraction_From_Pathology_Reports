Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS (A) RIGHT KIDNEY, ADRENAL GLAND AND INFERIOR VENA CAVA: CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 4 WITH EXTENSIVEI SARCOMATOID DEDIFFERENTIATION. (SEE COMMENT) TUMOR EXTENDS INTO THE PERINEPHRIC AND RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE TUMOR EXTENDS INTO THE ADRENAL GLAND. TUMOR MEASURES 18 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION TUMOR INVOLVES THE WALL OF THE RENAL VEIN/INFERIOR VENA CAVA AT THE MARGIN OF RESECTION (SEE COMMENT) Ureteral, renal artery and soft tissue margins of resection, free of tumor. Renal cortical (simple) cyst (2.2 cm in maximum dimension) COMMENT The tumor demonstrates extensive areas of sarcomatoid dedifferentiation composed of spindle cells with sheets of multinucleated giant cells. The sarcomatoid component comprises approximately 90-95% of the tumor. Although grossly the renal vein/inferior vena cava margin of resection appeared to be free of tumor, microscopically the tumor is involving the wall of the renal vein/inferior vena cava at the margin of resection. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT KIDNEY, ADRENAL GLAND, INFERIOR VENA CAVA - A nephrectomy specimen (22.0 x 15.4 x 8.0 cm) with attached adrenal gland (5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm) and ureter (8.0 x 0.5 cm).  An 18.0 x 14.0 x 12.0 cm partially cystic, tan, necrotic, hemorrhagic tumor penetrates the renal capsule, extending into the. perirenal adipose tissue and appears to involve the attached adrenal gland. The tumor does appear to involve the renal sinus. The aforementioned cystic regions are filled with yellow mucinous material. No papillary excrescences or masses involve the cyst walls. The largest cystic area measures 3.9 cm in greatest dimension and has a thick tan corrugated wall. 3.0 cm away from the primary tumor is a simple 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm cortical cyst. This cyst is lined by thin unremarkable. lining. The distal ureter, renal vein, and renal artery margins are grossly uninvolved by tumor. However, upon opening the renal.  vein, the tumor expands and fills the proximal portion of the renal vein.
