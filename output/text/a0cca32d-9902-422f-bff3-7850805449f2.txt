SPECIMENS: A. RIGHT COLON SPECIMEN(S):  A. RIGHT COLON GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT COLON: The specimen is received fresh and consists of a 14.5 cm segment of cecum and ascending colon and attached mesocolon. A 4.0 cm segment of terminal ileum is attached. The appendix is present and measures 7.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The serosa is unremarkable. There is a 6.0 x 4.0 x cm polypoid lesion present in the cecum which is confined to the mucosa. The lesion measures approximately 0.6 cm from the ileocecal valve. The tumor abuts the base of the appendix. The remaining mucosa of the colon is unremarkable. The mucosal surface of the small intestine is diffusely nodular suggestive of hypertrophy of the Peyer's patches. Multiple encapsulated nodules are dissected from the surrounding adipose tissue, the largest measuring up to 1.2 cm across. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1: Proximal margin, A2: Distal margin, A3: Base of appendix including representative section of tumor, A4: Representative section of tumor closest to ileocecal valve, A5: Additional representative section of ileocecal valve, A6-A12: Additional representative sections of tumor, A13: Sections of appendix. A14: Additional representative sections of colon, A15-A16: Additional representative sections of small intestine, A17: Single encapsulated nodule, A18: Single encapsulated nodule, A19: Single encapsulated nodule, A20: Single encapsulated nodule, A21: 2 encapsulated nodules one inked yellow, A22: 4 encapsulated nodules, A23: 6 encapsulated nodules, A24: 3 encapsulated nodules, A25: 3 possible encapsulated nodules, A26: 2 possible encapsulated nodules, A27-28: Multiple possible encapsulated nodules. DIAGNOSIS: A. COLON, RIGHT, HEMICOLECTOMY: - INTRAMUCOSAL WELL DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA ARISING FROM TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR - APPENDIX, NO TUMOR SEEN - TWENTY FOUR LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/24) - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE. NOTE: A microscopic focus of invasive well differentiated adenocarcinoma involving lamina propria is identified. The rest of the tumor which almost completely submitted for microscopic examination shows only tubovillous adenoma. Selective slides were reviewed by Dr. who concurs with the diagnosis.. SYNOPTIC REPORT - COLON & RECTUM Specimen Type:  Right hemicolectomy Tumor Site: Cecum Tumor Configuration: Exophytic (polypoid) Tumor size: 0.3cm WHO Classification Adenocarcinoma 8140/3 Histologic Grade: G1: Well differentiated Extent of Invasion:  Lamina propria Margins: Margin(s) uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (Proximal, Distal, Radial). Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Absent Perineural Invasion:  Absent Additional Pathologic Findings: None identified Extent of Resection:  R0: Complete resection with grossly and microscopically negative margins. Lymph Nodes: Negative 0 / 24 Implants: Absent Pathological Staging (pTNM): pT is N O M x  Pathological staging is based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition
