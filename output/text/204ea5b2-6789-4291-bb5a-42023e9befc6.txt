Medical history: Drug abuse cocaine type. Ethyl alcohol abuse. Benign essential hypertension. ADDENDA: Addendum added: Addendum added: -Final Pathologic Diagnosis-. A. Right parietal temporal brain biopsy: Low grade glioma. See comment.. B. Right parietal temporal mass excision: Low grade glioma (who grade II). See comment. commenc: Thougn the cumor is composed predominantiy of oligodendroglial elements, areas of nuclear pleomorphism with GFAp positivity raises the possibility of an astrocytic component. Assays for 1p and 19q are pending and a definite lineage will be rendered once the report is available. All controls show appropriate reactivity. The immunohistochemical and/or in situ hybridization tests reported here except for those addressing HER-2/neu overexpression, have been developed and their performance characteristics determined by the Immunohistochemistry and Histology Core Facility laboratories in the Department... of...

Page 2 --Addendum Report--- Addendum Status: Signed Out Detection of 1p36 and 19q by LSIe 1p36/LsI 1q25 and LSI 19ql3/19p13 Dual-Color Probe Sets Pathology Core Facility, Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory. Case No Outside Case#: Pathologist Patient Name:. Source of case Patient MRN: Block used B4 Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Tissue source Brain RESULTS Ratio of 0.89 Cell count of lp/lq: 142 Ratio of 0.70 Cell count of 19q/19p:. 131 Interpretation of Results: A) 1p no loss;. B) 19q loss Interpretation of findings: A) (negative) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 to 3 control. chromosome lq25 signals and 2 to 3 chromosome 1p36 signals. (locus of interest), and the ratio of 1p36/lq2s Ratio was >0.8.. The results are consistent with no loss of the lp36 locus of interest.. B) (positive) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 control chromosome 19pl3 signals and i chromosome 19ql3 signals (locus of interest). The ratio of 19q13/l9pl3 is <0.8. The results are. consistent with the loss of lp36 locus of interest.. Number of Observers: 2 Test Interpreted By: Comments The resultant Fish section/slide is scanned by a trained licensed medical technologist and analyzed using a FDA-approved, validated semi-automated scanning imaging workstation.  and accompanying imaging. analysis software The resultant Fish section/slide is then. presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will reviews the FISH. results from and compares them to the results manually observed under an Olympus Fluorescence Microscope. Therefore the ratio is enumerated. by computer-aided counting as well as manual counting.. Interpretation of Test The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of. LSI lp36 signals by the total number of LsI 1q25 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with. nonoverlapping-nuclei-in the-neoplastic glial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for probe set. 2 is derived by dividing the total number of Lsr 19ql3 signals by the total.

Page 3 F/ number of LsI 19pi3 signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at two different areas of the sample. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for allelic loss versus no allelic loss were established by evaluating both probe sets in a series of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs. For both probe set 1 and 2 a ratio of less than 0.80 taken from at least 2 sets of 20 interphase nuclei at 2 different areas with nonoverlapping nuclei is consistent with allelic loss. Frsh and H&&E stained slides have been reviewed by the interpreting pathologist. Limitations ANALYTE SpECIFIC REAGENT: The use of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (Asr). These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the Pathology Core Facility of. They have not been cleared by the Us Food and Drug Administration. Tne FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Addendum Status: Signed Out A and B: Right parietal temporal region, excision - Mixed oligoastrocytoma (who grade II). Assays detect intact ip and deletion of 19q loci. - INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: -- AF1. Right sided parietal temporal tumor (frozen section performed): Infiltrating glioma. Note: Examining pathologist - -mIcroscopic: -- Sections reveal an infiltrating glial neoplasm composed of cells having mostly round to ovoid nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are rare. Background slender vasculature is seen. In areas, the cells display nuclear pleomorphism and eosinophilic cytoplasm with processes. Immunostain for GFAp is positive in these areas and a Ki-67 stain shows a proliferation index of about 3t, by manual quantification.
