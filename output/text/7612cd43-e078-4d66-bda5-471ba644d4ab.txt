- Tumor type: Urothellal carcinoma. - Tumor grade: High grade. - Tumor size: 3.2 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm. - Extent of tumor in bladder: Invasive through muscularis propria into perivesicular tissue (slide C6). - Lymphatic/vascular invasion: Present. Slide C4. An immunohistochemical stain for CD34 was obtained and confirms the presence of tumor within small vascular spaces. - Epithelial abnormalities in bladder: None. - Extension of tumor into adjacent organs: None. - Margins: - Urethral margin: Negative (invasive tumor is 4.8 cm from margin).. - Right ureter margin: Negative. - Left ureter margin: Negative. - Perlvesical margin: Negative (tumor is 0.7 cm from margin) - Lymph node status: Negative. - total number of nodes examined: 25. - Other pathologic findlngs in bladder: Foreign body giant cell reaction consistent with prior transurethral resection of bladder tumor. - AJCc/UIcC stage: pT3aN0. While focal urothelial cell atypia is present on multiple frozen sections, the final permanent sections fail to show definitive urothelial dysplasia or carcinoma in situ in these sections. Dr..  has reviewed the frozen sections and corresponding permanent slides.

Clinical History The patient is an -year-old man with a history of high-grade urothelial carcinoma  involving the left lateral wall. He now undergoes a radical cystoprostatectomy with bilateral lymph node dissection. Gross Description The specimen is received in nine parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Parts A-C are recelved fresh. Parts D-I are received in formalin. Part A, additionally labeled *left ureter," consists of one, soft, pink, ovoid, irregular unoriented tissue fragment (0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 1, and Page 2 of 4

subsequently submitted in cassette A1.. Part B, additionally labeled "right ureter," consists of one, soft, pink, irregular, unoriented tissue fragment (1.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm). The entire intact specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in cassette B1. Part C, additionaily labeled "bladder and prostate," consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen containing bladder (312 gm; 10 cm from right to left x 4 cm from anterior to posterior x 22.2 cm from superior to inferior, with attached ureters) and prostate (4.5 cm from apex to base x 5.2 cm in width x 4.8 cm from anterior to posterior). GROss PATHOLOgIC FINDINGS: There is one soft, tan-pink to red, friable, fungating mass (3.2 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm) located along the left anterior wall, abutting the left ureteral orifice. The mass grossly appears to extend into the deep muscularis propria and is located O.5 cm from the anterior surgical margin, 1.3 cm from the posterior margin and 4.8 cm from the urethral margin. The remainder of the biadder mucosa is edematous and pink-red. Within the prostate there are multiple tan, rubbery nodules (largest 0.5 cm in greatest dimension) located centrally and one yellow-tan 0.4 cm cyst in the right mid-gland. the remaining prostate parenchyma is tan-pink. The ureters (left ureter 8.2 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter, right ureter 7.3 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter) are soft tan-brown without masses or lesions. One fleshy, tan lymph node is identified in the perivesicular soft tissue measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles are soft, lobulated, red-tan without obvious lesion or mass. ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks, trigone. INTRAOPERATIVE EVALUATION: Frozen section of urethral margin, en face, is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 3. INKING: - Anterior right surface: Green. - Anterior left surface: Blue. - Posterior surface: Black. GROSS PHOTOGRAPHS: Yes. CAssETTEs: Representative sections are subrmitted as follows: C1: Urethral margin, frozen remnant.. C2: Left ureter margin, en face. C3: Right ureter margin, en face. C4: Mass at left anterior wall, margin.. C5: Mass at closest approach to prostate. C6: Mass at left ureteral orifice, trigone. c7: Left posterior wall, adjacent to mass. c8: Right bladder wall. c9: Bladder dome wall. C10: Prostate, left apical margin, perpendicular. C11: Prostate, right apical margin, perpendicular.. C12: Prostate, left apex. C13: Prostate, left mid gland. C14: Prostate, left base. C15: Prostate, right apex. C16: Prostate, right mid gland.. C17: Prostate, right base. C18: Candidate lymph nodes, whole. C19: Posterior biadder wall. C20-C24: Candidate lymph nodes, whole. C25: Distal Prostatic urethra. Part D, labeled "right obturator nodes," consists of a single, soft, roughly ovoid piece of tan and pale yellow fatty tissue (4.2 x 2 x 1.2 cm). Two candidate lymph nodes are found (0.1 cm and 3 cm in  Page 3 of 4

greatest dimension). The candidate lymph nodes are submitted in cassette D1. The remaining fatty. tissue is returned to the container. Part E, labeled *right internal iliac nodes," consists of two, soft irregular pieces of brown and pale yellow fatty tissue (5.2 x 3.6 x 1.5 cm in aggregate). Seven candidate lymph nodes are found (0.5 cm to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension). The candidate lymph nodes are submitted in cassette E1. The remaining fatty tissue is returned to the container. Part F, iabeled "right external iliac nodes," consists of two, soft, irregular pieces of brown and yellow fatty tissue (3.2 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm in aggregate). Two candidate lymph nodes are found (0.7 cm and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension). The candidate lymph nodes are submitted in cassette F1. The remaining fatty tissue is returned to the container. Part G, labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes," consists of multipie, soft, irregular pieces of brown and yellow fatty tissue (5.5 x 3.5 x 1.7 cm in aggregate). Nine candidate lymph nodes are found (0.5 cm to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension). The candidate lymph nodes are submitted as follows:. Cassette G1: Seven nodes. Cassette G2: Two nodes. The remaining fatty tissue is returned to the container. Part H, labeled "teft ureter," consists of a single, firm, tubular piece of off-white tissue with attached brown fibrofatty tissue (1 cm length x 0.8 cm average diameter). The lumen is patent (0.2 cm. diarneter). One end has a metal clip; this end is inked blue, and the opposite end is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned and no lesions are seen. The entire specimen is submitted as follows: Cassette H1: Ends. Cassette H2: Central sections. Part I, labeled "final right ureter," consists of a single, firm, tubular piece of off-white tissue (2.8 cm Iength x 0.5 cm average diameter) with attached tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue. The lumen is pinpoint. One end has a metal clip; this end is inked blue, and the opposite end is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned and no lesions are seen. The entire specimen is submitted as follows:. Cassette I1: Ends. Cassettes I2-13: Central sections.
