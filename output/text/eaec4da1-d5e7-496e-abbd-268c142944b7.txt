NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. D. ALL FINAL MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF TUMOR. PATHOLOGIC STAGE pT4a, NO, MX. My s? station that I have personally reviewed the submitted material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in nine parts. Part 1 is received unfixed, labeled with the patient's name, initials, xx and "selective node dissection right, levels 2 through 4, stitch at 2B". The. specimen consists of a solitary 9.6 x 5.0 x 1.6 fibrofatty, focally. hemorrhagic tissue fragment with a black suture that marks level 2B. Lymph nodes are dissected and are submitted as follows: 1A 1B representative level 2 lymph node 1C level 2, two nodes 1D level 2, four nodes 1E level 2, four nodes 1F level 2, two nodes 1G level 2b four nodes 1H level 2b three nodes

11 level 3, four nodes 1J level four nodes 1K level 3, one node bisected 1L level 3, four nodes 1M level 4, four nodes 1N level 4, three nodes 10 level 4, three nodes. Part 2 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "lymph node level 4". The specimen consists of a 2.5 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm focally hemorrhagic fibrofatty tissue fragment. Lymph nodes are recovered and submitted as follows: 2A two nodes 2B one node. Part 3 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "lymph node zone 2". The specimen consists of a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm fibrofatty tissue fragment. The specimen is submitted as follows: 3A  one node 3B two nodes. Part 4 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "lymph node 2-4". The specimen consists of an 8.3 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm fibrofatty tissue fragment with a suture that demarcates level 2b nodes. The specimen is submitted as follows: 4A level 2, node A 4B level 2, node B 4C level 3, node A 4D level  3, node B 4E level 3, node c 4F level 4, node A 4G level 4, node B 4H loose fragment of tissue (two nodes) 4I level 2, two nodes 4K two nodes 4J level 2, four nodes 4K level 2,  five nodes 4 L level 2, one node 4M level 2, two nodes 4N level 3, three nodes 40 level 3, four nodes 4P level 4, two nodes 4Q level 4, three nodes 4R level 4, three nodes. Part 5 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "maxillary mucosa". The specimen consists of a 3.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm fragment of mucosal lined soft tissue. A representative section is submitted in cassette 5A. Part 6 is received unfixed for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials, xx and "right inferior maxillary, suture right resection of the maxillary sinus. This specimen is 6.6 x 5.0 x 2.2 cm with a stitch that demarcates the right lateral margin. The sinus mucosa is grossly unremarkable. On the inferior aspect of the specimen there is a 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm focally hemorrhagic friable mass that breaks through the superior cribriform plate. The tumor breaks through the bone; however, the anterior, superior and nasal septal bony margins appear to be grossly free. The lesion is 1.5 cm from the anterior margin, 1.5 cm from the medial margin and 0.6 cm

from the posterior margin. However, it is close, if not approximates, the lateral margin. A digital photograph is taken of the inferior aspect of the specimen with the tumor.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: 6AFs tissue nearest right lateral margin 6B anterior shave 6C medial shave 6D posterior shave 6E anterior bone 6F nasal septal bony margin (decalcification) 6G superior bony margin (posterior) (decalcification) 6H 6I tumor with bone (decalcification) 6J posterior soft tissue with tumor. 6K tumor in bone (decalcification) representative sections of tumor.. is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "maxillary bone fragment."  The specimen consists of an aggregate of fragments of bone that is 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted for decalcification in cassette 7A. Part 8 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "additional margin maxilla, right lateral plus superior." The specimen consists of a 5.5 x 0.1 x 0.3 cm focally hemorrhagic mucosa-lined tissue fragment. The specimen is submitted in its entirety in 8A or 8B. and "additional margin lateral and inferior." The specimen consists of a 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm focally hemorrhagic, soft tissue fragment that is submitted in tirety in cassettes 9A through 9B.
