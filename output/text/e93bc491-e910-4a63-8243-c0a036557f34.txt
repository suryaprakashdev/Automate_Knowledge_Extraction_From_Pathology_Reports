(SEES COMMENT) (B) RIGHT AXILLARY SENTiNEL LYMPH NODE #2, BIOPSY: One lymph node, no tumor present (0/1).. (C) RIGHT BREAST, TOTAL mASTeCTOMY: iNVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA WITH ASSOCIATED MILD LYMPHOCYTIC INFILTRATE, HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE  NOTTINGHAM HISTOLOGIC GRADE 3. (SEE COMMENT) INVASIVE TUMOR IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT AND MEASURES 1.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. FEW ADJACENT DUCTS WITH DUCTAL CARCINOMA iN SITU (DCIS), HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM TYPES WITH FOCAL COMEDONECROSIS, ASSOCIATED MICROCALCIFICATIONS, AND CANCERIZATION OF LOBULES. Columnar cell hyperplasia with associated calcifications also adjacent to tumor.. SINGE FOCUS OF INTRALYMPHATIC TUMOR. (SEE COMMENT) Tumor does not approach surgical margins.. Remaining breast tissue with mild tibrocystic change. Entire report and diagnosis completed by COMMENT  No tumor cells are identitied on the H&E stains of the sentinel lymph nodes. Immunostains for keratin were performed on each  the sentinel nodes (A1-A2, B1-B2), and a single keratin-positive cell suspicious tor an isolated tumor cell is present on one of the keratin stains trom sentinel node #1 (A2). A single cluster of tumor cells is noted within a dilated lymphatic channel next to the tumor. Because the channel is quite dilated and only a single focus is identified, it is unclear whether this represents true peritumoral lymphovascular invasion or displacement artifact '. Because on!y 5%. Tumor marker studies including FiSH for HER2 gene copy level were reported previously (see staining for estrogen receptor was reported, hormone receptor staining will be repeated on this specimen and reported in an addendum. icD-o-3 carcinoma,du<tcJ,in F 1tah nq 8S0oJ3 GROSS DESCRIPTION IZ RP (A) RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, IN VIVO 195, EX VIVO 181 - A 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm possible lymph node, serially sectioned and submitted entirely for frozen section in A1, A2.. *FS/DX: NO TUMOR IDENTIFIED.

RIGHT TOTAL MASTECTOMY - A right total mastectomy specimen (22.0 x 16.0 x 4.5 cm) with attached skin ellipse (10.0 x 5.2 x 0.5 cm). The skin ellipse contains an unremarkable nipple (1.0 cm). The specimen is sectioned trom lateral to medial into ten slices with the nipple in slices 7 and 8. An irregular (1.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm) solid white, gritty mass is identified in slice 6, located 2.5 cm from the deep margin, 5.2 cm trom the inferior margin, 5.5 cm from the superior margin, 5.5 cm from the skin, 6.5 cm tfrom the lateral margin, and 6.0 cm m the medial margin. The rest of the breast parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.. INK CODE: Blue - superior; orange - inferior; black - deep.
