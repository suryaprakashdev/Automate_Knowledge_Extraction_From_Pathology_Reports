Diagnosis/ diagnoses: 1. Right hemicolectomy preparation with an ulcerated colon carcinoma of the histological type of a moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, situated in the passage between the cecum and the ascending colon and measuring 6 cm in. diameter at the widest point. Invasive spreading of the tumor within all intestinal wall layers to the bordering fatty tissue. The cecum has a tubulovillous adenoma of. the mucous membrane with moderate epithelial dysplasia. The resection margins. and greater omentum are tumor-free. Two of ten lymph nodes with metastases of. the colon transversum. 2. Subcapsular liver parenchyma section with a complete cirrhotic remodeling and. pronounced fatty degeneration of the parenchyma (fatty liver cirrhosis). Tumor stage of is therefore: pT3 pN1 (2/10) L0 V0; G2 Follow-up report: As reported, a further lymph node preparation was carried out following acetone fixation. This revealed 31 lymph nodes ranging predominantly from very small to 0.7 cm in diameter. All lymph nodes in the histological examination were tumor-free. Therefore a final lymph node status of pN1 (2/41) is established.
