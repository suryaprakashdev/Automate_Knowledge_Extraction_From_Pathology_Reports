FOR SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Specimen #: Patient: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: -year-old with diagnosis of left breast cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT BREAsT LUMPEcTOMy received fresh labeled with the patient's name and designated "LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMy" is a piece of fatty tissue, 8.0 x 5.0 x 6.5 x 1.8 cm, impaled with a needle localization wire. The specimen is oriented with sutures (short-superior, long-lateral) and is inked as follows: Red-medial and lateral, blue-superior, green-inferior, yellow-anterior, black-posterior. The needle localization wire enters the specimen at the lateral margin. The tip of the wire is embedded in the mid portion of the specimen. The accompanying specimen radiograph is reviewed and shows numerous calcifications in the area of the wire localization. The specimen is serially sectioned, medial to lateral, revealing a poorly differentiated mass, 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, corresponding to the area of radiographic abnormality. The mass is firm and nodular, and contains at least two well-circumscribed masses with a tan, gritty cut. surface. The largest of these well-circumscribed masses measures 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The 3.0 cm mass abuts the superior and inferior. margins. The remaining tissue is variably fatty and fibrous; the fibrous tissue is firm and nodular in some areas. Sections of tumor and grossly normal fibrous tissue are harvested for the rotocol. Matched sections for histology are as follows:. A1-A2: Tumor. A3: Grossly normal fibrous tissue, medial portion of specimen.. A4: Medial most margin of specimen.. A5-A6: Full thickness cross section. A7-A9: Full thickness cross section. A10-A12: Full thickness cross section. A13-A15: Full thickness cross section.. A16-A18: Full thickness  cross section. A19-A21: Full thickness  cross section. A22-A23: Ful1 thickness s cross section. A24-A25: Full thickness cross section. Page 2 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF

NEW MEDIAL MARGIN, LEFT BREAST received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated "NEW MEDIAL MARGIN, LEFT BREAST" are two fragments of yellow/tan fibrofatty soft tissue. The largest fragment measures 7.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm and the smaller tissue fragment measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm. The specimens are received unoriented. The specimens consist of lobulated, yellow/tan soft tissue with areas of interdigitating white, fibrous areas. The outer surface of each specimen is inked in black. Cross sectioning through both tissue fragments demonstrates homogeneous, yellow, lobulated soft tissue with interdigitating white, fibrous strands. No discrete masses or nodules are found. Cassette key: B1-B8: Largest tissue fragment. B9-B15: Smaller tissue fragment.. C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER ONE received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated "SENTINAL LYMPH NODE NUMBER ONE" is a 0.7 grossly apparent lymph node and a small amount of adherent fat. A small. cm portion of the node is harvested for the protocol. The remaining lymph node is submitted. D. AxILLARy coNrENTs received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated "AxILLARy coNTENTs" are three fragments of fibrofatty soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. Sectioning through the specimen demonstrates a mottled, yellow/red fibrofatty soft tissue. Cassette key: D1-D2: Largest tissue fragment. D3: Second largest tissue fragment. D4: Remaining tissue fragment. Page 3 End of Repc FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY A
