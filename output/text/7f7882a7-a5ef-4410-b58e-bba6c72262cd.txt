Surgical Pathology Report B) Received fresh and designated "right distal ureter," is a 1x 0.4 x 0.2 cm red, soft tissue with ureter lumen, submitted in its entirety in cassette (FsB1) for intraoperative diagnosis. C) Received fresh designated "urethral margin," inked distal -- non-inked proximal," is a 1.8 x 1 x 0.3 cm soft tissue with urethral lumen. Submitted in its entirety in cassette (FsC1) for intraoperative diagnosis. D) Received in formalin designated "bladder," is a bladder with 12 x 8 x 1 cm of perivesicular fat. The bladder dome to urethra is 5.5 cm right to ieft is 10 cm and anterior to posterior is 5 cm. A 2 x 1.4 cm tan ulcerative lesion.  with evidence of prior biopsy is identified in the anterior lateral left bladder wall, 2.4 cm from the urethral margin and 3 cm from the left ureter orifice. The posterior surgical margin adjacent to the mass is inked black. On the cut. surface the mass is firm and tan and extends 1.5 cm from the bladder mucosa into the wall and detrusor muscles. The mass is 0.1 cm from the posterior soft tissue margin. After sectioning, the mass measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 2.9 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: (D1) Tumor to soft tissue margin (D2-D3) Sections of tumor (D4) Tumor to closest adjacent mucosa (D5) Right ureteral orifice (D6) Left ureteral orifice (D7) Bladder neck. (D8) Dome (D9) Right wall (D10) Left wall (D11) Posterior wall. (D12) Anterior wall. (D13) Trigone (D14-D22) perivesicular fat E) In formalin, labeled "ieft obturator node," are 3 cm of lobular fatty tissue with an interspersed lymph node which. is fusiform, 1 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node is submitted in its entirety as (E1). F) In formalin, labeled "L external iliac lymph node," is a lobular fatty tissue, 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm, with a central lymph node, 3.9 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm. The lymph node is submitted in its entirety as (F1-F5). G) In formalin, labeled "R external iiac LN," is a 4 x 2.9 x 1.1 cm lymph node with abundant attached fat. The lymph node is submitted in its entirety as (G1-G5). H) In formalin, labeled "right obturator iymph node," are 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm with lobular fatty tissues with interspersed Jymph nodes. The lymph nodes range from 0.6 cm to 1.5 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety as follows: 3

Surgical Pathology Report (H1) Two lymph node candidates (H2) Two lymph node candidates (H3) One bisected lymph node (H4) Multiple lymph node candidates I) In formalin, labeled "R common iliac lymph node," are fatty tissues, 2.5 cm in aggregate, with interspersed lymph nodes up to 1.5 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted in toto, one block as (l1). J) In formalin, labeled "L common iliac lymph nodes," are multiple lymph nodes up to 1.1 cm with abundant attached fat. The lymph nodes are submitted as (J1-J2) in toto. K) In formalin, labeled "R internal iliac LN," is a 2.9 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm encapsulated nodule suggestive of a lymph node with moderate attached fat. The cut surface is pink and homogeneous. In its entirety as (K1-K3).
