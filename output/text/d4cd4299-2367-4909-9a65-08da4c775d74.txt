SPECIMEN A. Omentum. B. Right colon. CLINICAL NOTES PRE-OP DIAGNOsIS: Right colon cancer FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS A - Benign fibromembranous and adipose tissue. A 4 mm stone is also present. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "omentum." It consists of a portion of soft glistening pink fibrofatty tissue measuring 2.4 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm. On section it is soft and pink. There is a 0.4 cm. hard yellow stone embedded within the tissue. The entire specimen ex. r the stone is submitted in one block. for frozen section. B. The specimen consists of a "right colon" which is partially covered with pink-tan smooth glistening serosa and abundant yellow lobular fat. There is a long suture marking the right colic and ileocolic pedicles. The specimen is stapled at both ends.  The specimen is predominantly covered with pink-tan smooth glistening serosa with abundant yellow lobular fat. The small bowel is 5.5 cm. long and the colon is 36 cm. long. The specimen is open and partially filled with dark bloody brown diffluent fecal material. The mucosa of the small bowel is smooth glistening having a circumference of 3.5 cm. There is an appendix present which is 6.0 x 0.7 cm. The colonic mucosa is pink-tan, smooth glistening and edematous showing multiple lesions. There is a 3.7 x 3 x 0.5 cm. ulcerated tumor located 4.5 cm. distal from the ileocecal valve. It is likely it extends through the muscularis propria, coming within 0.7 cm. of the radial margin. This tumor mass is 27.8 cm. from the

GROSS DESCRIPTION distal margin. A sample is taken for tissue procurement..  There is also a large sessile exophytic polyp which is 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm. This comes within 18 cm of the distal margin. There are a few additional polyps grossly identified, one on the ileocecal valve and others toward the distal end. These average 0.5 cm. to 1.0 cm. in greatest dimension and show no discrete invasions grossly identified in the large polyp previously described. Multiple lymph nodes grossly identified in the fat. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: Block 1 - Representative luminal. margin; block 2 - ileocecal valve with polyps; block 3 - entire appendix, proximal end inked; blocks 4-6 - Representative section of tumor to radial margin, ends normal; blocks 7, 8 - additional polypoid lesions toward distal end, full thickness; blocks 9-12 entire polypoid lesion full thickness; block 13 - ileocolic pedicle, block 14, additional tied off pedicle located distally; block 15 - three possible lymph nodes; block 16 - four possible lymph nodes; block 17 - four possible lymph nodes; block 18 - four possible lymph nodes; block 19 - four possible lymph nodes; block 20 - one possible lymph node. RS-20 MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A. Micro A performed. B. Multiple lesions are present within the right colon,. one of which is an ulcerated adenocarcinoma. Please see. the template below. Histologic type: Infiltrating adenocarcinoma. Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Primary tumor (pT): The tumor minimally extends into pericolonic. fat, pT3. Proximal margin: Negative for tumor. Distal margin: Negative for tumor.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative.. Distance of tumor from closest margin: 27.8 cm from the distal margin Vascular invasion: Negative. Regional lymph nodes (pN): All 21 regional lymph nodes are negative for metastatic disese, 0/21, pN0. Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: None.. Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed.. Other findings: Within the right colon, there is a large sessile tubulovillous adenoma. Additional smaller polyps are noted including two adenomas and one hyperplastic polyp. Appendix, no significant pathology.. 3, 14, 5 DIAGNOSIS A. Omentum, small excision - Benign fibroadeipose tissue with stone. B. Right colon, right hemicolectomy - Infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right colon, extending into pericolonic fat, pT3. All 21 lymph nodes negative for metastatic disease. All margins negative for tumor.. Large sessile tubulovillous adenoma, also present as well as two much smaller adenomatous polyps and one hyperplastic polyp. - End Of Report.
