Comment:The tumor cells are reaolive for CD10, RCC. racemase, and o-cadherin. They are negative for CK7, CK20, and  34BE12. Despite the unusual morphologic and immunohistochemical features. this is likely to represent a so-called collecting duct carcinoma. 2.

Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh labeled "right kidney tumor anu. acned ureter, renal vessels and. perinephric fat weighing 567 g in total.The kidney measures 11.4 x 9.2 x 7.5 cm.. The altached ureler measures 1.7 cm in length. and 0.4 cm in diameter. The altached renal vein measures 1.2 cm in tength and 0.3 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identified. The kidney is inked black and bivalved lo reveal a heterogeneous mass centered in the cortex of the midsection of the kidney measuring 9.2 x 7.5 x 7.0 cm. Parts of the tumor are myxoid and galatinous, while other areas show tan-yellow leshy tissue.. The tunor extends into the capsule of the kidney and. pushes into the hilum with focal exlension into the reral pelvis.  Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a well-defined corticomedullary junction. The cortex measures O.9 cm and the calyces appear normal. * lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric fat. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.. Summary of sections: FSC-frozen section control UVM -- ureteral and vessel margins. T.- tumor THF-- tumor with hilar fat. TSF -- tumor with sinus fat. TK -- tumor with adjacent kidney.

It consists of a tan soft tissue mass measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm.  The cut surface shows a tan and yellow soft lissue mass with necrosis and hemorrhage. Representalive sections are submitted. Summary sections: ST-solt tissue 3). The specimen is received in formalin tabeled "interaorlocaval lymph nodes number two. It consists of a tan soft tissue. fragment measuring 4.1 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a tan and yellow necrotic mass. Representative. sections are submitted. Summary of sections: ST-soft tissue 4).The specimen is received fresh labeled "right adrenal gland, paracaval and retrocaval lymph nodes". It consists of an. adrenal gland and attached soft lissue weighing 69 g and measuring 7.5 x 6.5 x 3.4 cm in overall.. The adrenal gland measures 5.8 x 4.1 x 1.0 cm. The cut surtace of the adrenal gland is grossly unremarkable.. The soft tissue is sectioned to reveal malted. grossly positive lymph nodes.  Multiple smaller lymph nodes are kdentified ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections of the adrenal gland are submilted along with representative sections of the malted lymph nodes.. The smaller lymph nodes are antirely submitted. Tissue is given for TPS.
