* Final Report Clinical History Right renal mass Specimen #1 Right kidney Gross Examination  Received fresh, placed in formalin and labeled right kidney is a 16.o x 9.5 x 6.0 cm nephrectomy specimen.  The specimen consists of a 358.7 gram, 13.0 x 8.5 x 5.5 cm kidney with attached perinephric adipose tissue and a 9.0 cm. long, 0.3 cm in diameter ureter. The adrenal gland is not present. Within the. upper to mid pole of the kidney is an 8.0 x 8.0 x 5.0 cm relatively. circumscribed mass. The mass has a soft, friable, variegated golden-yellow to dull yellow and focally hemorrhagic cut surface..  The mass is also focally calcified. The mass abuts and pushes against the renal capsule, but grossly. does not appear to extend through it, and comes to within 0.2-o.3 cm of the. radial soft tissue margin (inked black). The mass is at least 2.5 cm from the vascular margins. The parenchyma is otherwise maroon-tan with a distinct. corticomedullary junction (cortex 0.7 cm and medulla 1.2 cm). There are no. additional lesions identified.  There are no lymph node candidates identified at. the hilum..  The perinephric adipose tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate. no gross focal mass or lesion.  Following the written consent of the patient fresh tissue is submitted to the and the. Summary: "A", vascular and ureteral margins, tangential; "b", mass with respect to the renal capsule and radial margin, perpendicular; "c", additional section of mass with respect to adjacent kidney and renal capsule; nasswith respect to the pelvic adipose tissue; "g", uninvolved parenchyma. Microscopic Examination #1 Microscopic examination performed. Comment This case has been  reviewed in consultation with one additional departmental. pathologist.
