Left pelvic lymph node; dissection:. - Eleven lymph nodes, no tumor (0/11). C. Urinary bladder; cystoprostatectomy: - Bladder with high grade urothelial carcinoma invading thru the muscularis propria and extending into the perivesical tissue and seminal vesicle, see pathologic parameters. - Posterior margin is positive for urothelial carcinoma. - Prostate with prostatic adenocarcinoma, see pathologic parameters. Urothelial Carcinoma Pathologic Parameters 1. Tumor type: Invasive urothelial carcinoma. 2. Grade of tumor: High grade. 3. Depth of invasion: Extravesicular soft tissue and seminal vesicle. 4.

Effective January 1, 2010 this Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging system for prostatectomy of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC). Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the Resident/Fellow,[] M.D., Ph.D. Electronically Signed Out by [] MD Clinical History: The patient is a.  year-old male with history of high-grade urothelial carcinoma invasive into muscularis propria undergoing cystectomy and lymph node dissection. Specimens Received: A: Right pelvic lymph node B: Left pelvic lymph node C: Bladder, vas deferens, Gross Description: The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph. node". Received in formalin are multiple fragments of yellow, lobulated. fibroadipose tissue measuring 6.5 x 5.8 x 2.4 cm in aggregate. Multiple rubbery

lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.3-5.5 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: A1: Multiple candidate lymph nodes. A2: One lymph node, bisected A3-A5: One lymph node, trisected A6-A10: One lymph node B. The second container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph node". Received in formalin are multiple fragments of yellow, lobulated fibroadipose tissue measuring 7.5 x 5 x 1.9 cm in aggregate. Multiple rubbery lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2-6 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: B1: Multiple candidate lymph nodes B2: 2 lymph nodes, bisected B3: One lymph node bisected B4-B5: One lymph node, bisected B6-B9: One lymph node, sectioned C. The third container is additionally identified as, "bladder, vas deferens". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 301.8 g, 16 x 10.5 x 3.6 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The bladder measures 7.5 x 7 x 2.5 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 5 x 0.3 cm and the left 3 x 0.5 cm, and both demonstrate patent lumina. The prostate measures 4.2 x 3 x 2.9 cm. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.8 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm and the right vas deferens 8 x 0.5 cm. Detached vessels are also present measuring 5.2 and 5.5 cm in length by 0.3 cm in diameter The left seminal vesicle measures 2.4 x 1 x 0.5 cm and the left vas deferens 12 x 0.5 cm. Plastic tubing is present in the bladder. There is disruption of the junction of the prostate and bladder along the right side of the specimen. The urethral stump is flush with the prostate apex. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked black. The prostate is opened anteriorly along the urethra and continued superiorly through the bladder in a Y-shaped incision. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal an ill-defined, yellow-tan, firm lesion measuring 1.8 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm in the right prostate measuring 0.1 cm from the margin. The bladder demonstrates a tan, fungating, ulcerated 5.5 x 5.5 cm mass involving the dome, right lateral wall, right half of the anterior wall and some of the right posterior wall. The right ureteral orifice is involved by the mass. Serial sectioning reveals ill-defined tumor invasion into the adipose tissue to a depth of 1.4 cm, extending to 0.2 cm of the inked margin. The remainder of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and glistening with a uniform 0.2 cm wall thickness. The bilateral ureteral orifices are identified and probe patent. The perivesicular fat is extensively dissected for lymph nodes, but none are found. Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1: Left ureteral margin C2: Right ureteral margin C3: Urethral and prostatic apical margin
