Tumour size: 13.7 x 15 (4.4)mm. HJ 1117/14 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A fresh, intact left globe. Dimensions: Axial 22.5mm, Horizontal 24mm, Vertical 24mm Cornea: Horizontal 11.Smm, Vertical 1lmm Optic nerve Length 3.5mm, Diameter 4mm Pupil: regular Angle: normal On trans-illumination, a large shadow approximately 13.5mm in diameter is seen extending between the optic nerve and just anterior to the equator. Plane of section: oblique Intraocular description: On opening, a solitary dome shaped choroidal pigmented mass is seen - imm of the optic disc. Tumour size LBD 15mm, Height 4.7mm MICROSCOPY Sections show a variably pigmented choroidal melanoma of mixed cell type in which the epithelioid cells amount up to 60%. Focal peripheral area of the tumour shows clear cell changes / balloon type of cells. Tumour cells express Melan-A and HSp 27 (score 2). Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verifled:.

The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, and closed loops are present in the planes of. sections. The lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is minimal. Scattered macrophages are present. Tumour necrosis is not seen. Bruch's membrane appears breached in the. sections examined. There is minimal tumour extension into the sclera. No tumour is seen in sections of optic nerve or vortex veins examined. Tumour cells are not seen at the resection margins. Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The. anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is. shallow. The iris shows no significant abnormality but the ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of ciliary. processes. The lens shows subcapsular degenerative changes. Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic.. DIAGNOSIS Left eye, enucleation: Choroidal melanoma of mixed cell type.

These investigations were performed in the The kit p027 from  which examines for gains or losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using . and the quality assessed using multiplex-pcR prior to the MLPA reaction. The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on assessment. The MLpA reaction was run at least twice on differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLpA products is printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated: loss of chromosome 1p. monosomy 3, partial losses of chromosome 6 and gains in chromosome 8q. These molecular data require correlation with the clinical and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment. Reported: Pathologlst: Electronically Verifled: w 1G/l3 HIPAA Discrepa Case is (circle
