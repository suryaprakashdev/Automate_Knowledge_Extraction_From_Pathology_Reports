The specimen is inked, serially sectioned from medial to lateral into twelve slices. Located at slice 3 through slice 8, there is one pale-gray, firm, ill-defined nodule (3.2 x 21.8 x 2.7 cm) is identified, located at 0.2 cm from deep margin, 0.2 cm from the anterior margin, 0.2 cm from superior margin, 1.2 cm from inferior margin, 0.6 cm from medial margin and 2.2 cm from lateral margin. One clip is identified at slice 5, central portion. A portion of normal tissue and tumor is submitted for tumor bank. INK CoDE: Blue - superior; green - inferior; yellow - superficial; black - deep; red - lateral and medial. SECTiON CODE: A1, slice 1, entirely submitted of the slice, perpendicular for medial margin; A2, slice 12, central portion. lateral margin perpendicular; A3, slice 2, central portion with deep margin section adjacent to the lesion at slice 3; A4, slice 3, central portion nodule with anterior margin; A5, slice 3, central portion nodule with deep margin; A6, slice 3, central to inferior portion with the anterior margin; A7, slice 3 central to inferior portion tumor with the deep margin; A8-A14, entirely submitted of the slice 4 from superior to inferior direction; A15-A20, entirely submitted of the slice 5 from superior to inferior direction (A16 associated with clip); A21-A28, slice 6, entirely submitted of the slice submitted from superior to inferior direction; A29, slice 7, inferior portion with inferior and deep margin; A30, slice 8, superior portion with the superior margin; A31, A32, slice 8, central portion nodule with the deep nodule submitted from superior to inferior direction; A33, slice 9, central portion section adjacent to the lesion at slice 8. *GROSS EVALUATION: TUMOR EXTENDS SUPERFICIAL/SUPERIOR AND DEEP MARGINS. (B) LEFT BREAST IMPLANT AND PARTIAL CAPSULECTOMY - An 11.5 x 11.5 x 2.5 cm tan-yellow plastic breast implant devoid of contents. There is a 7.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm irregular piece of tan-yellow fibroadipose tissue attached to the surface of the breast implant. No inscriptions are noted. Representative sections of the fibroadipose tissue is submitted in B1-B2. Photos are also taken. (C) NEW SUPERFICIAL INFERIOR MARGIN, INK MARKS TRUE MARGIN - One pale-yel|low fibroadipose tissue (4.5 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm) with one side inked with purple to mark the true margin. The true margin is reinked and the specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted. INK CODE: Blue - true margin..
