Entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections Fsc frozen section control 5) The specimen was received fresh for frozen section and labelled. "posterior tonsillar pillar margin" and comprised a 0.8 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm piece. of muscular tissue. Entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections Fsc frozen section control 6) The specimen is received fresh labeled "Left radical tonsillectomy,. suture marks inferior" and consists of a 4.2 x 2.6 x 1.3 cm tan-pink tonsil. with a suture indicating the inferior margin. The suture is arbitrarily designated as 12:00. The surface of the tonsil exhibits a 2.5 x 1.8 x i.8 cm friable tan-white polypoid fungating tumor which is 2.1 cm from 12:00, 1.0 cm from 3:00, 2.0 cm from 6:00, and 1.6 cm from 9:00 from the mucosal. margin.  The deep margin in inked green from 12:00-6:00, and blue from. 6:00-12:oo. Serially sectioning displaya the tumor to abut the deep margin, with a maximal depth of 1.7 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: 12T- 12:00 tip, perpendicular S- sequential sections from 12:00 to 6:00, contiguous sections blocks :7-8, 9-10 6T- 6:00 tip, perpendicular FT- friable tumor 7) The specimen is received fresh labeled "Deep muscle additional resection". and consiats of a 1.7 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm irregular tan-red rubbery tissue which ** Continued on next page
