acted SUBMAXILAR RIGHT ADENOPATY: A pinky tissue fragment of 4,2 x 2,5 x 0,5 cm in which a lymph node of 3 cm is. identified. It presents geographic necrotic areas. LYMPH NODE, RIGHT SUBMAXILAR REGION (EXCISION): - DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, CD20 POSITIVE ASSOCIATED WITH EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS INFECTION Sections show a lymph node with total replacement of the architecture due to the presence of a diffuse infiltration of atypical lymphoid proliferation, composed of medium to large cells, anaplastic, some multinucleate, with prominent nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm. This neoplastic infiltration is associated with extents areas of necrosis and fibrosis. The tumor shows an angiocentric growth pattern.. The tumor cells are positive for CD20, CD79a, OCT-2, BOB.1, BCL2, MUM1, LMP1 and CD30, and are negative for CD10, BCL6, CD15, ALK1, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7 and CD8. The in situ hybridization for the RNA of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBER) is positive. The Ki67 proliferative index is high (70%).
