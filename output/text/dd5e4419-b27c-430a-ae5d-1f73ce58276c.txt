SOFT TISSUE, NEW INFERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION:  FIBROADIPOSE CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND SCATTERED ATROPHIC BREAST PARENCHYMA; NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY. Comments: Macroscopically, two masses were noted within the outer upper and outer mid regions, separated by approximately 1.5 cm. However, sampling of the. intervening tissue confirms the presence of invasive lobular carcinoma. The masses have a similar histologic appearance of invasive lobular carcinoma, grade 2. Therefore, the upper outer/mid tumors are best classified as a single mass and staged as pT3. A smaller separate tumor. is noted within the inner upper quadrant. ) and ancillary studies are reviewed.. The prior core biopsy This case received prospective peer review. ** ** Report Electronically Signed Out CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:S ear-old female with left breast cancer.

rOX OFFICIAL USE CWLY - PERSOXAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OP 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION: A: Received fresh, labelled with the patient's name and designated, "Sentinel Node #1" consists of 2.0 x 2.0~x 0.6 cm irregular portion of red-yellow soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a single 1.3  0.5 x 0.4 cm pink-tan lymph node. The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted in 2 cassettes.. B: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated, "Left Axillary Tissue" consists of two irregular shaped fragments of yellow lobular adipose tissue measuring 2.3 and 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning reveals six possible lymph nodes measuring up to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension each. The specimen is entirely submitted in three cassettes as follows: Bl- five possible lymph nodes; B2- one possible lymph node, bisected; B3- remaining adipose tissue. C: Receiv... fresh, labelled with the patient's name and de. .ated, "Left Mastectomy (Long-Lateral; Short-Superior)" consists of s0 gram mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior and ..ng st-. lateral. The specimen measures 25.0 cm medial to iateral; 21.0 cm r  to inferior; and 4.0 cm anterior to posterior. The light!. ed superficial skin ellipse measures 24.0 x 14.2 cm and J cm centrally located, everted nipple. No discharge is The deep margin is inked black. Serial sections reveal a 4.0 x 4. x 3.0 cr poorly defined mass in the mid-outer breast (mass #1). On sectsen'n?. t cut surface is firm, pink-white and shows a 0.3 cm bloc spsy cavity. The mass comes to within 0.5 cm of the deep ser/outer quadrant and lower/outer quadrant fibrous tissue mass is markedly dense and nodular. Located in the Juau.'ant, adjacent to the superior-medial portion of mass #1, is a sec.. fairly well defined mass measuring 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. This mass is lcsated 2.0 cm from the deep margin. The second mass is located approximately 1.5 cm from the first mass. The remainder of the specimen is. composed of lobulated, yellow-tan adipose tissue admixed with a moderate amount of otherwise unremarkable fibrous tissue. Located along the lateral edge of the specimen (at the junction of the deep and superficial margins) there is a single 0.4 cm ill-defined induration. This lateral margin is inked blue. No lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1- skin; c2- upper/outer quadrant mass; C3- upper/outer quadrant deep margin (to c2); C4- outer mid (OM) mass with cavity and deep margin; C5- deep margin, OM; C6- outer mid mass; c7-c9- additional outer mid mass; c1o-cii- induration along margin; C12- upper/inner quadrant; c13- lower/inner quadrant; C14-lower/outer quadrant; c15-upper/outer quadrant; C16- nipple; C17- sections of firm areas between first and second mass.. Matched sections of c1,c2,C4,C6-c9 and c12-c15 are submitted in Ocr and Page 3 Continued on Next Page. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
