Special Studies: Special Stain Comment Result TRICHROME IRON RETIC Gros 1. The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "sigmoid and upper rectum, stitch marks proximalIt consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 16.5cm. The serosal surface is smooth. The radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a polypoid tumor that is located 5.0 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 3.5 cm in length and 3.2 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion into tbe muscularis propria to a depth of 0.3 cm, which is 4.0 cm from the closest radial margin. A tattoo site is identificd distal to the tumox. The specimen is Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose submitted fox lymph node disseotion. tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. Tps is submitted. Summary of sections: PM --proximal margin DM distal margin RM -- radial margin -tumor polyp and tatoo aite -uninvolved mucosa LNS -- lymph nodes 2 The opecimen is xeceived in formalin, labeled Left liver biopsy and consists of two fragments of focally hemorrhagic tan-brown soft tissue *Continued on next page *
