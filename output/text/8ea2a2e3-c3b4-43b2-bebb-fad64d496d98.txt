The use of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (ASR). These tests were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the Department of Pathology Laboratory. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive and negative controls. DIAGNOSIS: A. BREAST, RIGHT, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIDE LOCAL EXCISION - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 3, WITH MICROPAPILLARY FEATURES(SEE NOTE) - INVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES 2.5 CM. - INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR MARGIN AND IS 0.3 CM FROM THE POSTERIOR MARGIN.  EXTENSIVE LYMPHVASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), SOLID TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE 3, WITH NECROSIS, MINOR COMPONENT. - DCIS IS FOCALLY WITHIN O.4 CM OF THE MEDIAL MARGIN. - PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES PRESENT. NOTE: The additional anterior inferior margin (specimen B) is free of invasive carcinoma. Surgical correlation is recommended. CD31 stains show positive staining around tumor foci near superior and posterior margins consistent with tumor in lymphvascular channels.

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Ailred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistrv was nerfnrmed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by Dako ., following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified.. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature.  information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: F12 (lymph node) Interpretation: NEGATIVE Intensity: 1+ % Tumor Staining: 5% Fish Ordered: No METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no lonaer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit using rabbit anti- human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides providea by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,  low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint re. commendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP  and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. CLINICAL HISTORY: year old female with Abnormal MMG- Bx Right Breast at 9-10 o'clock IDC ER-. MRI showed additiona! abnormality 2.6cm posterior to this.. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right Breast Cancer INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: FSD-TPD: One lymph node negative for tumor.
