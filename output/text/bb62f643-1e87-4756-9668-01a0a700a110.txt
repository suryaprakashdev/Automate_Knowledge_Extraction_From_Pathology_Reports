Non-Neoplastic Bowel: Unremarkable Appendix: Unremarkable Lymph Nodes: Number with metastasis: 0 Total number examined: 31 Tumor deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue: Not Identified Tumor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition): pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into. pericolorectal tissues) Lymph Node Stage (AJcc 7th Edition): N0 (No regional lymph node metastasis) I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. 1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon. The terminal ileum measures 12.0 cm in length and 3.6 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 14.0 in length with a circumference of 5.4 cm at the distal resected margin.. The attached appendix measures 5.8 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the. specimen measuring up to the 3.8 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a mass lesion measuring 2.1 cm in length and 2.8 cm in width. The mass is located in the right colon, 3.8 cm distal to the ileocecal valve, 17.0 cm from the proximal margin and 6.5 cm from the distal margin.. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the underlying muscularis. The depth of invasion is 0.5 cm grossly. The remaining mucosa is remarkable for a 0.7 x 0.1 to 0.4 cm sessile polyp 1.0 cm distal to the tumor.  The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for Tps.
