CLINICAL DETAILS 87703 Suspected choroidal melanoma. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 9J 1/7/14 A left eye. Dimensions: Axial 24mm, Horizontal 23mm, Vertical 23mm Cornea: Horizontal 12mm, Vertical 12mm. Description: clear Optic nerve Length 12mm, Diameter 4mm Anterior chamber: normal depth On trans-illumination, a shadow located superiorly measuring 19 x 18mm. Plane of section: vertical Intraocular description: On opening he eye a large pigmented choroidal melanoma. measuring 16mm LBD x 12mm in height.. Tumour size ;BD 16mm, Height 12mm MICROSCOPY Histologically, the enucleated eye demonstrates a normal anterior chamber and open angles. The iris leaves are unremarkable. The ciliary muscles are moderately atrophic and there is moderate hyalinisation of the ciliary processes. The lens shows advanced cataractous changes. In the posterior third of the posterior segment, a choroidal Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verifled:.

This is dome-shaped with a large. accompanying exudative retinal detachment. The retina overlying the tumour is atrophic with degenerative changes. The tumour is pigmented and consists of a mixture of cells, both epithelioid and spindle cells, with a dominance of the latter. The epithelioid cell component represents 15t of the tumour cell population.The melanoma cells are immunoreactive for MelanA and HSp-27 (score 2). The number of mitoses is high approx. 12/40 high power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, and closed loops are focally present. Occasional "yascular lakes" can be observed; in these tumour cells can be see located within the lumen. The lymphocytic infiltrate within tumour is minimal. Macrophages are scattered throughout the tumour in a moderately density.There is no evidence of scleral invasion or of extraocular growth. The optic nerve is tumour free. and demonstrates mild atrophic changes. The examined vortex veins are free of tumour. DIAGNOSIS Choroid melanoma of mixed cell type. COMMENT SPECIMEN 2= Eye TUMOUR PRESENTS Yes TUMOUR TYPE 1= Melanoma CELL TYPE 3= Mixed CT LOOPS 2- Closed loops NECROSIS No Reported Pathologist: Electronically Verified:.

A supplementary report will follow as soon as these investigations are complete.. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORTS In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma' tissue was performed. using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLpa). These investigations were performed in the The kit P027 from which examines for gains or losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using. and the quality assessed using multiplex-pcR prior to the MLPA reaction. The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on assessment. The MLpA reaction was run at least twice on differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLpA products is. printed on a separate report..
