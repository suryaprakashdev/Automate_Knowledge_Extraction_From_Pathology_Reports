Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Right kidney (  2: SP: Paracaval lymph nodes DIAGNOSIS: 1) KIDNEY,: RIGHT; NEPHRECTOMY: RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL TYPE WITH FOCAL SPINDLE CELL FEATURES, NUCLEAR GRADE III/IV. - THE PATTERN OF GROWTH IS SOLID.  THE TUMOR'S GREATEST DIAMETER IS 8.O CM. FOCALLY, THE TUMOR EXTENDS THROUGH THE RENAL CAPSULE BUT IS CONFINED WITHIN GEROTA'S FASCIA.  NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. -ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.  ANGIOMYOLIPOMA, SMOOTH MUSCLE PREDOMINANT (O.6 CM; SEE NOTE). THE ADRENAL GLAND IS NOT SUBMITTED. NOTE: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDIES OF THE ANGIOMYOLIPOMA ARE POSITIVE FOR SMA, FOCALLY POSITIVE FOR HMB-45 AND NEGATIVE FOR S-1OO PROTEIN. 2) PARACAVAL LYMPH NODE; RESECTION:  NINE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (O/9). Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled,. "Right kidney". It consists of product of right radical. nephrectomy which weighs 490 grams and measures 14.0 from Page 1 of 3

superior to inferior, 8.5 cm from medial to lateral and 5.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The soft tissue margins are inked blue. The specimen is bivalved revealing a fleshy mass in the superior pole which measures 8.0 x 6.5 x 3.0 cm. Portions of the tumor are yellow-orange and lobulated. In other regions, the tumor is homogenous, tan and firm. Approximately 25% of the tumor is composed of yellow-orange tumor and approximately 75% of the tumor has a homogenous tan appearance. Soft tissue margins are freely movable over the mass. The remaining renal parenchyma is tan-brown and unremarkable. The cortical thickness measure between 0.4 and 0.6 cm in thickness. The capsule strips with ease over the unremarkable parenchyma but is focally adherent in the region of the tumor. There is a 7.0 cm segment of ureter attached. The tumor does not involve the medullary cavity. The renal vein and artery are free of tumor. On serial sectioning, in the anterior aspect in the inferior pole, is a small, firm white nodule which measure 0.6 cm in greatest dimension.  This distinct nodule is located about 1.5 cm from the main tumor. Serial sectioning of the remaining of the large tumor mass reveals areas of hemorrhage and variable areas of necrosis. Examination of the hilar adipose tissue reveals no lymph nodes. Summary of Sections:.

It consists of a fragment of adipose tissue, measuring 4.0 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm. Cut-section shows a few lymph nodes, the largest measuring 2.5 cm in diameter. The larger lymph node is bisected..
