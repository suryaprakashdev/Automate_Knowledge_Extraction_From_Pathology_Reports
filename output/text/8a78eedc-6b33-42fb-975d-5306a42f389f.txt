Ipatian. Case # FINAL SUrGICAL PATHOLOGy REPORT Source of Specimen: Kidney;Rignt Clinical History/Operative Dx: Renal mass Gross Description: Single specimen received at this time designated as right kidney. Initially received in a tresh state for  tumor bank studies, is a 598 gram radical nephrectomy with an abundant perinephric fat, 17.5 x 10.2 x 5.6. cm. The adrenal gland is not included. The ureter extends out to 8.0 cm and narrows to 0.3 cm in  diameter with a pinpoint lumen. Initially a palpable mass is not appreciated, and the kidney is bisected, to reveal a well circumscribed, glistening pale tan tumor mass near the upper pole, measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.6. cm. This tumor abuts the anterior and posterior renal capsules. Anteriorly the Gerota's fascia overlies the perinephric fat which extends out to 0.7 cm from the tunor mass (A4, A5), and the posterior fat extends out to 0.6 cm (A6). The mass lesion approaches to within 0.1 cm of the fatty sinuses. A representative portion. of tumor is submitted for tumor bank studies.  The renal vessels extend down 2.5 cm, with the margins greater than 4.5 cm from the tumor mass. The pelvis is 3.0 x 1.8 cm, with glistening light tan mucosa.. without grossly invasive tumor. The cut sections of the kidney demonstrate a distinct cortical medullary  gross tumor involvement and no grossly distinct lymph node tissue candidates. Representative sections are. submitted. Cassette summary: A1) ureter and renal vascular margins, A2) posterior and anterior renal pelvis represented, A3-A5) representation of tumor, renal capsule, Gerota's fascia, A6) tumor, posterior renal capsule and overlying fat, A7) tumor, adjacent renal sinus, A8) uninvolved kidney represented. Microscopic Description: Immunohistochemical stains: Tumor cells positive tor CK7, CD117, PAX-8 and CD10. Tumor cells  negative for Vimentin. The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are compatible with diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Appropriate positive and negative immunohistochemical controls have been reviewed.
