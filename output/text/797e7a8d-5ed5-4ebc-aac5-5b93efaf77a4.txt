IcD6-3 Caensnianenal cIl SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Chrsmsphobe tyjee 8317|3 Case Number : Sut OfidnyNOS C649 Diagnosis: 9tJ 8/qf 3 A: Kidney, left, laparoscopic nephrectomy Tumor histologic type/subtype: Renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type Sarcomatoid features: not identified Histologic grade: 2 (of 4, Fuhrman classification) Tumor size: 5.5 cm diameter Tumor focality: unifocal Extent of invasion: Extra-capsular invasion into perirenal adipose tissue: not involved Renal sinus: not involved. Major veins: not involved. Ureter: not involved Venous: not involved Lymphatic: not involved. Surgical margins: Perinephric adipose tissue margin: negative Renal vein: negative Ureter: negative JUID:933DE352-E2B3-4C8C-9828-EF549B971814 Adrenal gland: not received TCGA-UW-A72S-01A-PR Reda acted Lymph nodes: not received AJcc Stage (kidney): pTlb pNx pMx This staging information is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Clinical History:. -year-old female with renal neoplasm. Gross Description: Specimen A:

Specimen fixation: Fresh, and later placed in formalin Type of specimen: Left laparoscopic nephrectomy. Side of specimen: Left Size and weight of specimen: Weight 425 gram, 16.0 x 8.5 x 5.5 cm Orientation: The perinephric fat is inked blue. Presence/absence of adrenal gland: Absent Tumor site: Renal cortex, mid pole Tumor description: The tumor is tan/pink, soft with punctate. hemorrhage and a 1.5 x 1.4 cm central area, which is yellow soft and liquified. The tumor appears well-circumscribed, with an. area suspicious for extracapsular extension. Tumor size: 5.5 x 4.7 x 4.2 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: Absent Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: A foci where the mass appears to extend through the renal capsule. Extent of invasion:. Perirenal adipose tissue: May involve Gerota' s fascia: Does not involve Renal vein: Does not involve Ureter: Does not involve Renal Sinus: Does not involve Pelvicaliceal: Does not involve Adrenal: N/A. Other organs: N.A. Surgical margins:.

Perirenal adipose tissue: Negative Renal vein: Negative Renal artery: Negative. Ureter: Negative. Description of kidney away from tumor: Within the inferior pole'. there is a 0.4 cm in greatest dimension smooth walled cyst. The remainder of the kidney parenchyma is tan/red with a distinct cortical medullary junction. Hilar lymph nodes: None Other significant findings: Tissue submitted for Yes, tumor and normal is submitted to Digital picture: No. Block Summary: Al - Ureteral vein and artery margins, en face. A2-A3 - Mass with respect to capsule and perinephric fat,. perpendicular A4 - Mass with respect to sinus fat A5 - Mass with respect to capsule and perinephric fat. A6 - Uninvolved kidney parenchyma to include cyst. Tissue remains in formalin. Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. Sections of the renal neoplasm show a discrete encapsulated. population of dyscohesive cells with perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing and prominent plasma membranes. Zones of fat necrosis are noted. By H & E alone, the differential diagnosis includes chromophobe carcinoma and granular cell/conventional renal cell carcinoma, less likely oncocytoma. Immunostains were performed to clarify lineage, and show diffuse reactivity for cK7 and colloidal iron, subset reactivity for Rcc and c-Kit, and. no reactivity for vimentin. This immunophenotype supports. chromophobe carcinoma, makes conventional Rcc unlikely,. and excludes oncocytoma. Dr. concurs.. hw 7f30f13.|
