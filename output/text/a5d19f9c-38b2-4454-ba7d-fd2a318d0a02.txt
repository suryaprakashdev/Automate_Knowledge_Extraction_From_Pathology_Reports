Ratio of Her2-neu over chromosome 17 signals. RANGE FOR INTERPRETATION: Ratio less than 2.0: Her2-neu gene amplification not observed. Ratio equal to or greater than 2.0: HEr2-neu gene amplification observed. ER/PR IMMUNOSTAINS ARE NEGATIVE. CI INICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: YO FEMALE WITH SMALL 1X.6CM COMPLEX MASS BY U/S AT INFERIOR/LATERAL RETROAREOLAR PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: FIBROUS TISSUE VS MALIGNANCY POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Post-operative Diagnosis: SAA GROSS DESCRIpTION: RIghT BReAsT TIssuE "inferior lateral retro-areola" consists of a single irregularly shaped fragment of fibro fatty tissue, which previously has been inked and sectioned.
