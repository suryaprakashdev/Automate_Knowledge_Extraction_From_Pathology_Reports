TCGA-B9-4114 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Surgical Pathology Report Accession #: Diagnosis: Kidney, left, radical nephrectomy Histologic tumor type/subtype: Papillary renal cell carcinoma with necrosis Histologic grade (if applicable): Fuhrman grade 3 Tumor size (greatest dimension): Multi-focal, largest focus is 22 cm in greatest dimension Extent of tumor invasion: Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: Negative for tumor; the capsule is focally thinned, but intact Gerota s fascia: Negative for tumor Renal vein: Negative for tumor Ureter: Negative for tumor Venous (large vessel) Negative for tumor Lymphatic (small vessel): Present Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: Negative for tumor; closest perirenal adipose tissue margin at area of focally thinned capsule is 1 mm.A5). Gerota's fascia: Negative for tumor Renal vein: Negative for tumor Renal artery: Negative for tumor Ureter: Negative for tumor

Adrenal gland: Not present Lymph nodes: Not identified grossly Other significant findings: Focal glomerulosclerosis AJCc Staging: pT2 pNx pMx This staging information is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Clinical History: with a clinical history of a large left renal mass, now undergoing left radical nephrectomy the patient has known papillary renal cell carcinoma. Gross Description: Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally labeled "left kidney." Specimen fixation:formalin Type of specimen: radical nephrectomy Side of specimen: left Size and weight ofspecimen:2,370 grams;22x17 x12 cm Orientation: Inking: exterior surface=black Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent Tumor description/site: Tumor effaces and expands almost the entire kidney parenchyma. Tumor size:22 x 15 x12 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: multicentric with at least very large abutting masses and several peripheral satellite masses; the largest masses are at least 10 cm in

greatest dimension each Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: tumor appears to abut, but does not extend through the renal capsule NOTE: Upon receipt in the gross room, an approximately 4.5 cm defect on the exterior surface of the specimen is noted, through which tumor extrudes. This site is inked yellow. Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: tumor grossly does not involve Gerota' s fascia: tumor grossly does not involve Renal vein: tumor grossly does not involve Ureter: tumor grossly does not involve Other organs: not applicable Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: grossly negative Renal vein: grossly negative Renal artery: grossly negative Ureter: grossly negative Description of kidney away from tumor: Compressed, but grossly unremarkable. Lymph nodes (hilar): not identified Other significant findings: none Tissue submitted for special investigations: normal and tumor sample tissue provided to Tissue Procurement. Digital photograph taken: not taken Block Summary: Inking: exterior surface=black, area of defects noted (as described above) upon receipt in the gross room-yellow) Al -hilar vascular and ureteral margins, en face A2- additional sampling of hilum A3-tumor A4- tumor, possibly involving collecting system A5 -tumor, ?extracapsular extension A6 -tumor,?extracapsular extension adjacent to A5) A7 -tumor, ?extracapsular extension (adjacent to A6) A8 - tumor, site of defect noted on exterior surface at time of receipt A9- tumor interface with normal kidney
