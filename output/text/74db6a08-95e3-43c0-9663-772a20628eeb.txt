PROCEDURE: APDXE 1. Adrenal gland, left, resection: Adenocortical carcinoma, low-grade by mitotic activity, with capsular and vascular invasion. Ki-67 proliferation marker shows a proliferation rate above that typically found in benign tumors. See COMMENT. rCim IcD 03 COMMENT : This adrenocortical neoplasm has a very low mitotic activity as assessed by counting of mitotic figures. The Ki-67 proliferation marker shows a proliferation rate that is consistent with the diagnosis of low grade adrenocortical carcinoma. In addition, research immunostains show a similar proliferation rate using topoisomerase 2-alpha. Furthermore, the tumor shows. diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity for cyclin E which is also consistent with a. diagnosis of carcinoma.
