NOTB: Same mmunohstochemical arzibodies are analyte specific reagents (ASRs) validated by aur iabontory. These ASRs are clmcaly usefis indicators that do nct requsre FDA approval. These clones are used. 1D5=5R, PgR 636-PR, A485=HER2. H-11=EGFR. All mmnohustcchemical staws are used wth fomalin or molecuar fixed, paraffin embedded tssue. Detectson is by Bnvision Method. The ressts are read by a pathologist as panive or negative. As the attending pathologist, I attest that I: (i) Examined the relevant preparation(s) for the specimen(s); and (ii) Rendered the diagnosis(es). ***Electronically Signed Out By*** Procedures/Addenda Addendum Date Ordered: Status: Signed Out Date Complete: Date Reported: Addendum Diagnosis The tumor cells are positive for ER and PR, negative for HER2 (0).. Clinical History:. Status post previous lumpectomy Operation Performed Left breast completion, mastectomy with axillary node dissection. Pre Operative Dlagnosis: Left breast cancer. Specimen(s) Received: A: Left breast (short superior and long lateral). B: Intra mammmary lymph node C: Left axillary lymph nodes D: Additional left breast tissue E: Level 3 lymph nodes F: Lymph nodes above brachial plexus Gross Description: A. Received in formalin is a modified left radical mastectomy specimen that weighs 190 grams and measures 16.0 x 11.0 x. 1.0 cm. There is a tan ellipse of skin that measures 6.3 x 5.8 cm, an areola measuring 4.2 x 4.0 cm and a nipple that. measures 1.0 cm. There is a white lesion on the 11 o'clock aspect of the areola that measures 0.5 cm in greatest. dimension. Along the 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock aspect of the nipple, it appears to be slightly retracted. Grossly, no other lesions or masses are identified. The specimen has previously being inked black and sectioned to allow for fixing. On cut section, there is a 7.5 x 6.0 x 2.0 cm ill-defined, indurated, tan/yellow lesion that is retro-areolar in location. This lesion comes within 0.2 mm of the deep margin, 0.6 cm from the inferior margin, 4.5 cm from the superior margin, 3.5 cm from the inferior margin, 4.5 cm from the lateral margin and 2.5 cm from the medial margin. The remainder of the breast parenchyma is composed predominantly of homogeneous yellow adipose tissue with a 20% stroma to 80% adipose tissue ratio. Grossly, no lymph nodes are identified. A small section of the specimen was taken for research. Sections. submitted as follows: Page 3 of 4

Received in formalin are several fragments of fibroconnective adipose tissue that measure in aggregate 5.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. Grossly, five lymph nodes are identified, ranging in size from 1.0 to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
