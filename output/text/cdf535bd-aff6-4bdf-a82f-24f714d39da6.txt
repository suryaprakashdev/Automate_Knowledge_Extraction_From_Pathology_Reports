GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Right)breast tissue (AFl)", received fresh. An oriented breast excision with sutures as follows: Long - lateral, short - superior, (Dr. A 4.3 x 0.8 cm ellipse of tan skin with a 6.8 x 5.2 x 3.4 cm of underlying fibrofatty breast tissue is inked as follows: Superior - blue, inferior black, posterior - green. The specimen is sectioned from lateral to medial to reveal a circumscribed firm yellow sabulous 2.4 x 1.5 x approximately 1.5 cm mass. The mass is within 0.i cm of the green inked posterior margin and within 0.2 cm of the blue inked superior margin. The lesion's edge is approximately 0.4 cm from the black inked inferior margin, 2.5 cm subjacent to the skin surface and approximately 0.6 cm from the lateral margin. The adjacent parenchyma is  composed of lobules of yellow-pink adipose intermixed with focally dense white-pink fibroconnective tissue with no additional lesions noted..  Representative sections from the mass is frozen as AFl.  The remnant is submitted as Al.. Block Summary: A1 Frozen section remnant. A2-14 Representative sections from lateral towards medial respectively.  The sections include the entire lesion in relationship to the closest margins as well as the lateral margin (A2) and the medial margin Al4. A15-25 Remaining breast, submitted in toto. See photograph on file in pathology department for location of blocks. B. "Right breast tissue new posterior margin suture in new margin", received fresh. A 3.9 x 2.7 x 0.8 cm portion of fibrofatty tissue with a suture on one surface. The suture surface is marked blue, the specimen is transversely sectioned and entirely submitted as Bl-b4. C. "Right breast tissue new superior margin suture on new margin", received fresh. A 4.1 x 2.7 x 1.2 cm portion of yellow-white fibrofatty tissue with a suture present on one surface. The suture surface is marked blue, the specimen is transversely sectioned and submitted as C1-c4. D. "Right axillary node, suture on apex". received fresh. An 11.2 x 7.5 x 1.2 cm portion of fibrofatty tissue with a suture present at the apex. The specimen is dissected for lymph node candidates. Block Summary: D1 - 1 Lymph candidate proximal. D2 - 3 lymph node candidates, medial.. D3- 6 Lymph nodes, medial. D4-5 Bisected lymph node candidate. D6 2 lymph node candidates, distal. D7 - 2 lymph node candidates, distal.. 37 /Dr. INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: A. "Right breast tissue" AFl- invasive carcinoma present. (Dr. DIAGNOSIS : A.

RESULTS WILL BE ISSUED IN AN ADDENDUM. coMMenr: Although there is very little in-situ carcinoma within the invasive tumor mass, there is a large area of Dcis adjacent to the tumor, extending in a medial direction to near the medial margin.  Based on the number of slides involved, the Dcis involves an area of approximately 4.8 cm in largest. dimension. B.

Page 3 of 3 Electronically signed: ADDENDUM 2: This addendum is issued to report the results of an additional study. The previous diagnoses are unchanged. An immunostain for HEr2/neu shows moderate (2+) membrane staining in approximately 50-75% of the tumor cells and is. interpreted as posiTivE for HER2/neu overexpression. METHODOLOGY: Immunostaining for HEr2/neu (c-erbB-2) oncoprotein is performed on recut. sections of Block A6. The imnunostaining is done using DAko rabbit anti-human. c-erbb-? oncoprotein which is an affinity-isolated antibody. product number . The immunostaining is performed after antigen retrieval by. heating the unstained sections at 95 degrees centigrade for 20 minutes in 10. hour at 37 degrees centigrade. The Histostain Plus kit is used as the detection system. I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es)..
