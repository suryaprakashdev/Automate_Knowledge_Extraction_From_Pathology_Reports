celiac axis or SMA: Yes Tumor involves celiac axis or SMA: No Lymphatic invasion: Identified Large vessel invasion: Not identified Margins: Common bile duct: Negative Proximal duodenal: Positive Distal duodenal margin: Negative Proximal or distal pancreatic margin: Negative Peripancreatic soft tissue margin (including retroperitoneal and posterior. pancreatic margin): Negative Total regional lymph nodes: 30 Number positive: 7 AJCC Pathologic Stage: pT3 N1 (AJCC 7th edition, 2010) Dictated and authenticated by: Performing Location: Gross Description A. CORE LIVER BIOPSY  Received fresh labeled with the patient name Description: The specimen consists of two cylinders of tan-brown tissue having lengths of 0.7 and 1.2 cm and diameters of less than O.1 cm. The specimen is entirely embedded for a frozen section diagnosis. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS PERFORMED AT No evidence of malignancy. SECTIONS: A1. Frozen section control. B. WEDGE LIVER BIOPSY Received fresh labeled with the patient name Description: The specimen consists of three pieces of tan-brown tissue ranging from O.5-1.0 cm in greatest dimension, each of which reveals a white-tan nodule measuring up to 0.1 cm in greatest. specimen. The specimen is entirely embedded for a frozen section diagnosis.. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS PERFORMED AT No evidence of malignancy. SECTIONS: B1. Frozen section control.

C. COMMON HEPATIC ARTERY LYMPH NODE Received in formalin labeled with the patient name Description: The specimen consists of an irregular piece of yellow-brown tissue measuring 3.1 cm in greatest dimension, from which are retrieved three lymph nodes which are submitted in their entirety.. SECTIONS: C1. One longitudinally bisected lymph node c2. One intact lymph node and one inked and longitudinally bisected lymph node. D. PRODUCT OF PARTIAL PANCREATICODUODENECTOMY: Received fresh labeled with the patient name Specimen received: Product of a partial pancreaticoduodenectomy Orientation given: Two medium length sutures, one long suture and two long sutures identify the bile duct, pancreatic neck and SMA margin respectively, per the intraoperative consultation form. Integrity: The pancreatic component is intact; the duodenum is unopened. Size of pancreas: 6.5 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm Length of duodenum: 19.0 cm. Ducts: Probe patency cannot be demonstrated between the common bile duct and the ampulla.. Ampulla: The ampulla is easily probed from the pancreatic duct. Inking scheme: The anterior and posterior surfaces of the pancreas are inked blue and black respectively. The margins of the common bile duct and the pancreas are inked purple and green. respectively, after the true pancreatic margin is embedded for a frozen section diagnosis. The concavity. created by the portal vein is inked yellow and the SMA margin is inked orange. Tumor site: Within the head of the pancreas Tumor size: Tumor is estimated to measure 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. Tumor description: White-tan, waxy, poorly circumscribed Invasion of: The tumor surrounds the common bile duct, compressing it to a diameter of less than 0.1. cm, having a diameter of 1.7 cm at its margin of resection. Distance from margins: The tumor appears to most closely approximate the pancreatic margin of resection by 0.5 cm, the bile duct margin by 3.0 cm, the anterior blue ink aspect of the pancreas by apparently less than 0.1 cm, the posterior pancreas by 1.0 cm, the concavity created by the portal vein by O.5 cm and the SMA margin by 1.0 cm. Remaining specimen: The small intestinal component has stapled margins of resection, scant serosal adhesions, an average wall thickness of 0.3 cm and an unremarkable mucosa. Peripheral to the tumor the pancreas reveals unremarkable cut surfaces, excepting for a 1.1 cm smooth-walled cyst. Lymph nodes: The lymph nodes retrieved from the specimen are submitted in their entirety. Representative sections are submitted with the pancreatic component being submitted proceeding from the margin towards head.. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS PERFORMED AT Indicated margins: All negative for carcinoma. SECTIONS: D1. Frozen section control of common bile duct margin D2. Frozen section control of pancreatic margin D3. Frozen section control of SMA margin D4-5. En face proximal and distal duodenal margins, respectively
