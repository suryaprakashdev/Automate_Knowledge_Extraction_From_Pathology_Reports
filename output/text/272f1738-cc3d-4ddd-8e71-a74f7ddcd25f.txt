TCGA-B9-4117 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Surgical Pathology Report Accession #: Diagnosis: A: Fat,hilar,Nos, removal -No tumor seen. B: Kidney, left,hand assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy Histologic tumor type/subtype: papillary renal cell carcinoma,type2 Histologic grade: Fuhrman nuclear grade 3 Tumor size (greatest dimension) 84 cm Extent of tumorinvasion: Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: negative Gerota's fascia: negative Renal vein: negative Ureter: negative Venous (large vessel): negative Lymphatic small vessel):negative Adjacent organs: not applicable Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: negative Gerotas fascia: negative Renal vein: negative Renal artery: negative Ureter: negative Adrenal gland: not submitted

Lymph nodes: none identified AJCC StagingpT2 pNx pMx This staging information is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Clinical History: with clinical diagnosis of left renal mass. Gross Description: Received are two appropriately labeled containers. Container A is additionally labeled "hilar fat." It holds a 4.8x2.0x1.6 cm somewhatdisruptedfragment of red/yellow lobulated fibroadipose tissue. The fragment is palpated and no lymph node candidates are readily identified. The fat is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in blocks Al-A4, Container B: Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: hand assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy Side of specimenleft Size andweight of specimen: 550 grams18x 11 x7.5 cm nephrectomy specimen (kidney and fat); the kidney is approximately13.8x7.5x7.5 cm Orientation: The specimen is received previously incised by the surgeon. The perinephric fat is markedly disrupted. The entire length of the kidney is received opened exposing the tumor.Margin evaluation will be difficult given the disrupted nature of this specimen. The kidney capsule in the area of the previous incision is inked blue. Presence/absence of adrenal gland: Absent; the superior perinephric fat is disrupted along with the vast majority of the remaining perinephric fat

Tumor description/site: Tumor is a mid kidney anterior cortical lesion with a solid, somewhat soft yellow diffusely brown and hemorrhagic cut surface. A portion of the tumor is missing as is adjacent normal kidney. These are presumed to be taken Tumorsize:8.4x7.3x6.0 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: The tumor is abutting the overlying blue inked capsule. Given the perinephric fat is not disrupted, it is believed to be not attached. Exact determination of confinement cannot be determined. Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: cannot determine Gerota'sfascia: absent Renal vein: tumor does not involve Ureter: tumor does not involve Other organs: n/a Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: cannot determine Renal vein: negative Renal artery: negative Ureter: negative Description of kidney away from tumor: The remainder of the kidney consists of dark red/brown renal parenchyma with a distinct corticomedullary junction. The cortexis approximately1 cm and the medulla is up to 1.8 cm. There is no evidence of papillary necrosis. The renal pelvis is unremarkable. Lymph nodes (hilar): There is scant hilar adipose tissue present. No hilar lymph node candidates are identified. Hilar fat was submitted as specimen A. Other significant findings: none Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor was taken by Tissue Procurement. Digital photograph taken: no
