Specimen x-ray is lesion. The specimen consists of a portion of breast tissue which measures 7.5 x 6 x 2 cm. A needle is situated in the spscimen..  The margins have not been differentially tagged Blue ink is applied to the margins. Sections reveal a firm. tan tumor measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm located 3 mm from the nearest surgical margin. A representative section of the is removed by aseptic technique and submitted for tumor banking..  The following tumor sections are submitted: 1-5 tumor sectioned and totally submitted. blue ink on margins. representative breast and margins B. This specimen in the frash state is a soft, tan lymph node measuring 12 x 10 x 7 mm. sectioned and totally submitted as block B1. ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

RUN DATE: RUN TIME: PAGE 3 RUN USER: SPEC #: PATIENT: (Continued) MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A. Sections of the breast tumor demonstrate invasive ductal carcinoma with focal apocrine features, combined histologic grade 2 of 3.  DcIs is present axhibiting comedo and cribriform growth patterns with nacrosis and a high nuclear grade. The ncis does not. appear extensive. Nearby breast tissue uninvolved by tumor demonstrates at least one radial sclerosing lesion and foci of ductal epithelial hyperplasia, focally atypical. The inked margins appear uninvolved. See the comment for a synoptic report.
