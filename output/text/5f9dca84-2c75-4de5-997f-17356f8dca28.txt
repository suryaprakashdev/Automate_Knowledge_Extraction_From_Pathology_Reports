The specimen is received labeled with the name of the. patient and as omental mass. It consists of an irregular portion of soft tan-brown tissue and attached fat measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm. The specimen is inked blue. Cut sections reveal a red-brown cut surface. The specimen is entirely submitted in Bl-B3.. C. The specimen is received labeled with the name of the patient and as lymph node, left pelvic. It consists of two irregular pieces of soft tan-brown tissue measuring 3 x 1.6 x 1.3 cm. The specimen i.  serially sectioned and entirely. submitted in Cl-c5. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sections of the grossly identified renal tumor show carcinoma with papillary morphology. The tumor is characterized by multinodular growth and tumor cells with moderately pleomorphic medium to large oval nuclei with occasional nuclear grooves and ample eosinophilic to vacuolated cytoplasm. In areas the papillary formations are densely packed and essentially solid. There is multifocal intratumoral hemosiderin and formation of cystic nodules filled with papillary tumor and blood. Tumor abuts the fibrous renal capsule, but does not clearly invade perirenal fat on multiple levels examined. There is invasion of small non-muscularized veins in the renal sinus but no definitive invasion of the renal sinus fat or large branches of the renal vein. The tumor is associated with a significant and extensive diffuse and nodular lymphocytic infiltrate at the periphery of the lesion that also extensively involve perinephric and renal sinus fat, and show sheets and nodules of cells extensively involve the remaining non-carcinomatous renal cortex. These are monomorphic-appearing small lymphocytes, and by immunohistochemistry are diffusely positive for cD20 and BcL-2. The same B cells are negative for cD5 and cD23, which highlights residual germinal center dendritic cells. CD3 and cD5 show staining in a smaller population of T lymphocytes. BcL-6 and cyclin Dl are negative. Sections of the omental nodule show a spherical accessory spleen with relatively normal splenic architecture and small periarterial lymphoid nodules. The adipose tissue. surrounding the splenule is involved by dense sheets and nodules of the same lymphoid infiltrate with identical

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: A. Kidney, left, radical nephrectomy:. - Papillary renal cell carcinoma (histologic type 2), 5.5 cm. in greatest dimension. - Carcinoma is confined to the kidney, without invasion of renal sinus fat, muscularized branches of the renal vein, or perinephric fat. - Carcinoma shows invasion of small non-muscularized vessels. in renal sinus. - Small B-cell lymphoma most consistent with extranodal. marginal zone lymphoma, with diffuse involvement of kidney, perinephric fat, and renal sinus..  Ureter, vascular, and soft tissue resection margins are negative for carcinoma. - See B. Omentum, excisional biopsy of mass:. -- Accessory spleen, with surrounding adipose tissue involved. by small B-cell lymphoma. C. Lymph node, left pelvic, excision: - One lymph node, involved by both metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma and small B-cell lymphoma. CANCER CASE SUMMARY KIDnEy: Resection (Version 3.0.0.0.)
