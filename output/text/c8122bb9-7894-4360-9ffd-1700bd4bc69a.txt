UUID:C8653D2E-3A8C-4C3B-8638-9BC503E7EBC1 TCGA-UW-A7GG-01Z-PR Redacted Diagnosis: Kidney, right, nephrectomy. - Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, nuclear grade 3, maximum tumor size 10 cm, tumor confined to kidney with negative surgical margins. and no evidence of involvement of the renal artery, renal vein or ureter. Comment: Drs. and have additionally reviewed this case and concur with. the diagnosis of the chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, nuclear grade 3. LCD-O 3 Coreinons,Nenal ceQL ChLomphobe tyee 8317l 3 Clinical History: RKiolney NOS The patient has a right renal mass. Sst C64.9 A 9124|I3 Gross Description: Received is one appropriately labeled container additionally labeled "right renal mass." Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: radical nephrectomy Size and weight of specimen: 10.0 cm superior to inferior, 14 cm medial to lateral, 7 cm anterior to posterior; 570 grams. Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent Tumor description: the tumor is a globoid, well circumscribed by a. pseudocapsule, hilar, nodular lesion which on cut surface is softened with yellow/tan color and focal hemorrhage; no central scars are grossly identified Tumor size: 10 x 8 x 7 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent Confinement/Non-confinement to kidney: the tumor is confined by the. renal capsule Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: tumor does not grossly involve.

Renal vein: tumor does not grossly involve Ureter: tumor does not grossly involve Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: grossly negative Renal vein: grossly negative Renal artery: grossly negative Ureter: grossly negative Description of kidney away from tumor: the renal cortex is atrophied to 0.5 cm; the calyces are mildly dilated; hydro-ureter is absent Lymph nodes (hilar): none identified. Tissue submitted for special investigations: none Comment: The external surface is uniformly inked blue; representative sections are submitted as per block summary. Block Summary: Al - ureteral renal vein and artery resection margins. A2 - tumor interface with renal hilum A3 - tumor interface with perinephric fat A4,A5 - representative sections of tumor A6,A7 - representative sections of non-tumorous kidney Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. Histologic tumor type/subtype: chromophobe renal cell carcinoma,. consistent with eosinophil chromophobe type Histologic grade (if applicable): nuclear grade 3 Tumor size (greatest dimension): 10 cm Extent of tumor invasion: Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: negative Renal vein: negative Ureter: negative Blood vascular: negative Lymphovascular: negative Depth of invasion: not applicable Adjacent organs: not applicable. Anaplasia (applicable only to wilm Tumor):

Presence/absence: not applicable. Extent: not applicable Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: negative. Renal vein: negative Renal artery: negative Ureter: negative Adrenal gland: not present Lymph nodes: not identified Other significant findings: The tumor consists of a cellular neoplasm without true encapsulation which shows a predominant solid growth pattern with admixed tubular and trabecular patterns as well as interspersed stromal hyaline fibrosis particularly in the central regions of the tumor. The tumor consists of an admixture of larger polygonal cells with well defined cell borders and amphophilic cytoplasm and large numbers of admixed small polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Distinct perinuclear halos are present in many cells. Many nuclei show hyperchromatic. features with markedly irregular nuclear membranes and scattered binucleation. The features are consistent with a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, eosinophilic type. This case was shown in consultation to Drs. and who concur with the diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, nuclear grade 3..
