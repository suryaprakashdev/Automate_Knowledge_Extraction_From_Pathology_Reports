RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY:S INVASIVE LOW-GRADE ADENOCARCINOMA WITH MUCINOUS DIFFERENTIATION ARISING IN ASSOCIATION WITH TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA OF CECUM TUMOR MEASURES 9 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION AND INVOLVES VISCERAL PERITONEUM 17 REGIONAL LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IDENTIFIED PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT MARGINS NEGATIVE WITH CLOSEST MARGIN MESENTERIC/RADIAL WHICH MEASURES 5 MM ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: SEPARATE SESSILE SERRATED ADENOMAS APPENDIX WITH PERIAPPENDICEAL CHRONIC INFLAMMATION COMMENT(S) The large mass involving the cecum is an invasive adenocarcinoma with areas of mucinous differentiation noted. While most of the tumor is low grade. there are microscopic foci where the tumor is of a higher histologic grade. The tumor extends into the proximal appendix as well as involves the subserosa of the distal ileum. will be further evaluated for KRas mutation and mismatch repair defect (by IHc). Additional reports will follow.. CAP PROTOCOL FOR THE EXAMINATION OF SPECIMENS FOR PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY CARCINOMA OF THE COLON AND RECTUM Based on AJCC/UICC TNM. 7th Edition.

MARGINS : Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: 5 mm. mesenteric/radial TREATMENT EFFECT : No prior treatment LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified PERINEURAL INVASION: Present TUMOR DEPOSITS: Not identified PATHOLOGIC STAGING: Primary tumor: pT4a Regional lymph nodes: pN0 Number of lymph nodes examined: 17 Number of lymph nodes involved: 0 Distant metastasis: pM1a GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh for frozen section. labeled with the patient's name and "liver biopsy" are several core biopsies of pale. tan and red tissue which range from 0.2 to 1 cm in diameter to 0.1 cm each. submitted in block A for frozen section evaluation.. B. Received fresh for tissue banking labeled with the patient's name and "right colon" is a 15 cm sagment of large bowel. The bowel includes cecum and a 7.5 cm appendix consistent with a right colon.  There is a 13 cm sogment of distal ileum. The bowel has a palpable. 9.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm mass associated with the cecum. The distal ileum is focally adhesed to the mass.  The bowel is opened to have an edematous mucosa. There is a focal area of. identifiable fungating tumor at the appendiceal os. Visible tumor is 1.5 cm and is deep within the cecum.  The tumor comes to within l1.0 cm of the distal margin and is approximately 1.5 cm from the ileocecal valve. There is a sessile 0.3 cm polyp within the ascending colon. The polyp is 7.5 cm from the distal margin.  Sectioning of the tumor shows it to bulge beneath the small bowel. The tumor focally involves the wall of the small bowel and possibly to the mucosa. The tumor tracks up the base of the appendix. and there is a large. feted 3.0 cm abscess cavity in the adipose adjacent to the mass and cecum. The tumor appears to involve the cecal serosa. The radial mesenteric fat margin averages 1.0 cm.  The adipose in the region of the cecum and ileocecal valve havs centrally necrotic. tumor-replaced. matted lymph nodes.. Representative sections are sampled as. labeled: B1 proximal margin B2 distal margin B3 sections of appendix to include tip. B4 ileocecal valve B5.B6 sections of mesenteric fat margin. B7 sections of possible polypoid lesions adjacent to ileocecal valve and ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **
