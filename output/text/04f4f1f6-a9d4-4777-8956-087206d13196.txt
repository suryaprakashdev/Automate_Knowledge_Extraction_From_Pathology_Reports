UUID:F0519EDE-C458-43C6-BD3F-4E67059E8FCE TCGA-B1-A470-01A-PR Redacted Collection Date: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Kidney, RIght, ParTial NephreCtomy--  PAPILLARy RENAl CELl CARCINOMA, FAVOR TYPe 2, mAximAl FUHRmAn nUCLEAR GRADe 3 OUt OF 4, SeE COMmenT. TUMOR iS LIMITeD TO THE KIDNEY AND MEASURES 5.6 x 5.0 x 4.0 CM. C. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR. 'NO VASCULAR INVASION' IS IDENTIFIED E. .PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT1b NX MX F. PERITUmORAL NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY WITH INTERSTITIAL INFLAMMATION AND SCATTERED SCLERO'TC GLOMERULI. COMMENT: The tumor cells show prominent eosinophilla and focai areas of necrosis. The Fuhrman nuclear grade ranges bet/ean 2. and 3. Some of the Fuhrman grade 2 areas with fbrohistlocytic cores resemble type 1 paplllary renal cell carcinonia, ! ut overall a dlagnosis of type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma is favored. Immunohistochemical stains are performed with adequate controls and demonstrate that the tumor cells are strongly. positlve for p504s and AE1/3 and show focat / patchy positivity forCK7, CA9, and EMA. These findings support the above diagnosis.
