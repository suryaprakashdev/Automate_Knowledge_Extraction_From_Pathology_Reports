SEE COMMENT. Comment: The aspirates are pauci-cellular and reveal rare small clusters of malignant epithelial cells in a background of blood. Only rare reactive bronchial cells and sparse inflammatory cells are present. The tumor cells are large with abundant granular cytoplasm and well defined cell borders. The nuclei are enlarged and mildly pleomorphic with moderately irregular contours, coarse chromatin and prominent central nucleoli. The morphologic findings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma. To confirm the diagnosis and help exclude a primary lung tumor, we performed a panel of immunohistochemical stains on the cell block material with the following results: Antibody Usual reactivity. Result CD10 Renal cell marker,. Positive Pan-keratin Epithelial marker Positive CK 7 Epithelial marker. Positive CK 20 Epithelial marker. Negative RCC Renal cell marker Negative CD 68 Histiocyte marker Negative TTF-1  Pulmonary cell marker. Negative The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic diagnosis. Positive staining for CD10 and pan keratin with negative staining for CK 20 is consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Although CK7 is often negative in most renal cell carcinomas, positive staining can be seen in up to 1/3 of cases. Similarly, negative staining for RCC is seen in approximately 13% of cases. Negative staining for CD68 indicated the tumor cells are not reactive pulmonary macrophages which can have similar morphology in rare cases. Negative staining for TTF-1 also rules against a diagnosis of a primary lung carcinoma. Overall, based on rnholooy and immunohistochenica findings the final diagnosis is that of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. nave reviewed this case and concur with the diagnosis. Lung, Left, nodule, fna: LESS THAN OPTIMAL - SCANT CELLULARITY. NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. HYPERCELLUALR SPECImEN WITH REACTIVE EPITHELiAL CELLS AND BLOOD (see comment) Comment: Because of the minute size of the lesion and technical difficuity of this biopsy, a limited sampling was obtained. No definitive evidence of malignancy identified. Immunohistochemical stains for CD10, RCC and CD68 are non-contributory. Additional studies should be considered if clinically indicated.
