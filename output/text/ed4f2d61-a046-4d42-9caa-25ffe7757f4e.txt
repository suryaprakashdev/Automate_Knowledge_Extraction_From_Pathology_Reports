The section surface shows a homogeneous whitish color LEFT CERVICAL LYMPH NODE (EXCISION): - PRIMARY MEDIASTINAL DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA Sections show a lymph node with the architecture effaced by atypical lymphoid proliferation, composed by sheets of large and pleomorphic cells, some with Reed-. Sternberg morphology, accompanied by a background of small cells. The neoplastic cells are positive for CD20, CD79a, CD30, CD23, CD22, BCL2, MUM1/IRF4 and BCL6 and negative for CD10, CD15 and EBER. A moderate amount of reactive T-cells, CD3 and CD5 positive is found. Stains for immunoglobulin light chains have not been contributory. The Ki67 proliferative index is 70-80%..
