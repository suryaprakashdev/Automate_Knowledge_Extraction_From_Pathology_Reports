Patient: Case # ADDENDUM SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Source of Specimen:. A. Breast:left complete mastectomy B. Breast;right modified radical rnastectomy Clinical History/Operative Dx: None provided. Gross Description:. A. The specimen is labeled left breast complete mastectomy and is received in formalin. It consists of a. mastectomy specimen which weighs 227 grams. A black suture with a metallic clip marks the "tail ot the. breast". With this orientation the specimen measures 18.5 cm from medial to lateral, 11.8 cm from superior to inferior, and 2.5 cm superficial to deep. There is an overlying broad ellipse of dark brown skin. which ineasures 17 x 6.5 cm. Centrally and slightly superiorly within the skin is a 2.3 cm areola and a protuberant O.7 cm nipple. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior nargin is inked. green and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth fascial tissue, is inked hlack. The specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal lobulated fatty tissue and centrally located. tan-white fibrous parenchyma. There are no areas which have a stellate or retracted appearance suggestive of neoplasm. In the lateral portion of the specinen, 2 cm from the lateral edge, there is a circumscribed 0.7 cm pale red lymph node. Representative sections are submitted.

Patient: Case #: ADDENDUM SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 8. The specimen is labeled right breast modified radical mastectony and is yeceived without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy specinen together with axillary tissue weighing 292 grams. The breast measures 16 cm trom medial to lateral, 9 cm from superior to interior and up lo 4 cm from superficial to deep. There is an overlying ellipse of dark brown skin whch neasures 15.5 x 7.6 cm. Slightly medially located within the skin is a circumscribed 2.5 cm areola and a protuberant 0.6 cm nipple, The skin is unremarkable.. Axillary tissue is present and measures 15 x 6.5 x 1.8 cm. The anterior-superior nargin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior nargin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth tacial tissue, is inked black. In the central lateral portion of the deep margin, there is a 3 x 0.5 cm band of skeletal muscle which is indicated by the surgeon as pectoralis inajor behind the tumor. The specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a relatvely well-circumscribed. firm, tan-white tumor mass beginning directly underneath the nipple and extending laterally within the breast. This tumor mass measures 4.7 cm from medial to laleral, 4.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 3.5 cm from superticial to deep. This neoplasm is 3.5 cm fron the closest medial margin, 5 cm from the axillary tail. 2.5 cm from the closest superior margin,and 2.2 cm fron the closest inferior margin.Centrally,it is grossiy 0.2 cm from the closest deep margin and does not appear to extend into the small strin of pectoralis muscle. The remainder of the breast is composed ot soft fatty tssue without other palpable masses. Representative tumor and adjacent breast parenchyrna are obtained for research purposes. In the medial portion of the axillary tail, there is a prominent firm 1.5 cm lymph node suspicious for metastatic. involvement. Representative tissue from this lymph node is obtained for research purposes also. The axillary tissue is dissected for nodes. Representaitve sections are submitted..

Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT B. The specimen is labeled right breast modified radical mastectomy and is received without fixative. It consists ot a mastectomy specimen together with axillary tissue weighing 292 grams. The breast measures. 16 cm trom medial to lateral, 9 cm from superior to inferior and up to 4 cm trom superticial to deep. There is an overlying ellipse ot dark brown skin which measures 15.5 x 7.6 cm. Slightly medially located within the skin is a circuinscribed 2.5 cm areola and a protuberant 0.6 cm nipple.

This tumor mass measures 4.7 cm from medial to lateral, 4.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 3.5 cm trom. superficial to deep. This neoplasm is 3.5 cm from the closest medial margin, 5 cm fron the axillary tail. 2.5 cm trom the closest superior margin, and 2.2 cm from the closest nterior margin. Centrally, it.is grossly 0,2 cm irom the closest deep margin and does not appear to extend into the small strip of pectoralis muscle. The reinamder of the breast is composed of soft fatty tissue without other palpable masses. Representative tumor and adjacent breast parenchyma are obtained for research purposes. In the inedial portion of the axillary tail, there is a prominent firm 1.5 cm lymph node suspicious for metastatic invoivement.
