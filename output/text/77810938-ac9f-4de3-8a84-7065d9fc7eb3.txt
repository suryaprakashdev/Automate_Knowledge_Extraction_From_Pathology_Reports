DIAGNOSIS: ****CORRECTED REPORT***** Revised report to change and clarify staging in synoptic report; the synoptic. should read: Macroscopic extent of tumor: Tumor limited to kidney. Venous invasion: Indeterminate (see comment): Comment: There are foci within the renal sinus suspicious for vascular invasion. nas reviewed slides C-I and P-S. as reviewed slides C-I and Dr. Right kidney,nephrectomy Oncocytic neoplasm with features most consistent with chromophobe renal cell. carcinoma, see synoptic report. Kidney: Nephrectomy, partial or radical Synopsis MACROSCOPIC Specimen Type: Right radical nephrectomy.

Focality: Unifocal. Tumor Size Greatest dimension: 13.8 cm. Macroscopic extent of tumor: Tumor extends into renal sinus vein. MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma.. EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor: pT2: Tumor more than 7 cm in greatest dimension, limited to the kidney Regional Lymph Nodes:pNX: Cannot be assessed Distant metastasis: pMX: Cannot be assessed Margins: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.. Adrenal gland: Not present. Venous invasion: Present. Additional Pathologic Findings: None identified ADDENDUM: Tumor stains positively for PAx-2, C-kit and CK7 and Clinical:Right kidney mass. Gross: The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name the medical record number and "right kidney." It consists of a nephrectomy specimen with attached perinephric adipose tissue that measures 25.0 x 15.0 x 7.5 cm overall. A segment of ureter is present that measures 1.0 cm in length. An adrenal gland is not present. The kidney is bivalved.A mass is present that measures 13.8 x 7.0 cm. The mass has replaced the majority of the kidney. The cut surface of the mass has areas that are both solid and cystic. yellow. brown and hemorrhagic with extensive necrosis present. Tumor invasion into the perinephric adipose tissue is not identified. Invasion of the renal vein is not grossly

dentified.The tumor does not appeal the renal parenchyma. No lymph nodes are grossly evident. The mucosa of the ureter and. pelvis are unremarkable.The specimen is represented as follows; A = ureter margin, B = vascular margins,C-I = mass,J= normal kidney, K-O = hilar fat (possible lymph nodes), P = mass from region of pelvis, Q-S = mass in relation to perinephric fat.
