Surgical Pathology Report. Clinical Diagnosis and History: Bladder ca Stage 3 Tissue(s) Submitted: 1: LEFT DISTAL URETER 2: LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES 3: RIGHT DISTAL URETER 4: RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES 5: BLADDER AND PROSTATE 6: LEFT URETER TRUE MARGIN 7: RIGHT URETER TRUE MARGIN Gross Description: Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left distal ureter and consists of a 0.4 x 0.2 cm tubular tissue  which is submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis labeled FS1A. The frozen residue is submitted in the corresponding cassette. Specimen #2 is received in formalin labeled left pelvic lymph nodes and consists of a 5.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate of fat which is palpated to reveal multiple nodes ranging from 0.1 cm to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted as follows: 2A: three possibie nodes 28: two possible nodes 2C-2F: each cassette containing one bisected node 2G-2I: one trisected node 2J-2M: one serially sectioned node 2N: 1 bisected node  Specimen #3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled right distal ureter and consists of a 0.6 x 0.4 cm tubular tissue  which is submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis labeled FS3A. The frozen residue is submitted in the corresponding cassette. Specimen #4 is received in formalin labeled right pelvic lymph nodes and consists of a 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm aggregate of fat which is  palpated to reveal multiple possible nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted as follows: 4A: four possible lobes 4B-4C: each cassette containing two nodes 4D-4G:  each cassette containing one bisected node 4H-4I: one bisected node. 4J-4K: one serially sectioned node 4L-4N:  one serially sectioned node Specimen #5 is received fresh labeled bladder and prostate and consists of a 12.5 x 11.0 x 5.0 cm bladder with attached 5.0 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm prostate. Extending from the prostatic urethra is a 35.0 x 0.7 cm catheter. Partially surfacing the posterior aspect is a 14.0 x 10.0 cm area of smooth peritoneum. Attached to the prostate are right and left vas deferens averaging 5.0 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm and the right seminal vesicle 4.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm. The right half of the specimen is inked blue, the left half is inked black and the specimen is opened with a Y-shaped incision along the anterior aspect to reveal an 8.0 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm focally soft and necrotic papillary lesion involving the dome, posterior, anterior and left lateral wall of the bladder. Noted on the prostate, at the bladder base, are several papillary growths grossly not contiguous with the main mass measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. Further sectioning reveals the mass effacing an area of muscle in the left lateral wall, focally possibly invading into the adipose tissue, 0.3 cm from the posterior ink. The tumor does not grossly appear to involve the ureter. Serial  sectioning of the prostate reveals a 1.5 x 0.6 cm ill defined tan lesion in the right apex towards the posterior aspect, grossly abutting the inked capsule. Palpated are five possible nodes ranging from 0.1 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Note that approximately 90% of the prostate is submitted. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 5A: possible urethral margin en face  5B-5C: perpendicular sections of right apical prostatic margin. 5D-5E: perpendicular sections of left apical prostatic margin. 5F-5G: bisected section of trigone with papillary growths near bladder base of prostate. 5H: trigone with prostate to include papillary growths near prostatic bladder base 51: right ureteral orifice 5J: Ieft ureteral orifice. 5K-5N: tumor to closest ink from left lateral wall (contiguous sections) 50: tumor to left lateral wall with possibly involved fat. 5P: tumor to possibly involved vessel from left lateral wall.
