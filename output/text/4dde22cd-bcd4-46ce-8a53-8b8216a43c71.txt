Received fresh labeled "Sentinel node 2 count  " containing 1.3 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm pale yellow, soft lymph node. It is bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.. C.  Received in formalin labeled "Left breast lumpectomy, 1 superior, 2 lateral 3 deep" is a lumpectomy specimen of the breast weighing 180 grams. It is oriented with sutures by the surgeon. It measures 7.5 cm in superior to inferior, 7.0 cm medial to lateral surface, 3.5 cm anterior to the posterior surface. The specimen is inked as follows: Blue superior, green inferior, red medial, orange lateral, black posterior,. yellow anterior. Upon sectioning, there is a 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm tan-white, firm gritty mass with stellate borders. It is approximately round to oval in shape. The mass contains a metallic clip measuring 3 mm. The mass is closest to the anterior margin which is 0.7 cm away. It is 3.0 cm away from the posterior margin, 2.0 cm from the superior margin, 2.6 cm from the inferior margin, 4.0 cm from the medial margin and 2.5 cm from the lateral margin. The rest of the breast parenchyma is yellow and soft with fat to stroma ratio 90's to 30. A piece of tumor measuring approximately1.0 x 1.0 cm is submitted to the tissue bank. Sections are submitted as follows:. Cassettes #1-6  Mass in toto (cassette 1 mass with clip) Cassette #7 Anterior margin.
