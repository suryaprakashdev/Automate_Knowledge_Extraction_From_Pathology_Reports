FcDt3 Cecum C18.D Site Report 9J 4/1o/3 SURGICAL PATHOLCGY IRGICAL PATHOLOGY UUID:E997748F-FB20-4CF3-8621-96618187AF2E TCGA-QG-A5Z2-01A-PR Redacted PORT Accession No. RIgHT hEMICoLECToMy BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY: PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: colon cancer OPERATIVE FINDINGS: POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: colon cancer Surgeon/physician: PATHOLOGY REPORT Labo atory Accession No GrOSS DesCRIpTIOn: The specimen consists of a 27.8 cm in length segment of right colon with 4.7 cm of attached terminal ileum. The specimen is stapled at both ends with a moderate amount of attached fat. The serosa is tan-pink to red, smooth and glistening. There is a 7.2 x 0.8 cm intact vermiform appendix. Opening reveals a tan-brown smooth glistening ileal mucosa with normal folds. The ileocecal valve is tan-yellow and thickened. The colonic mucosa displays a 3.8 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm tan-red slightly raised polypoid mass that is 9.3 cm from the proximal resection margin, and 19.8 cm from the distal resection margin.  Sectioning through the mass reveals a focal area of invasion going into the underlying muscle layer. The mass does not extend to the inked serosal surface. The mass is 7.3 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The remaining colonic mucosa is tan-brown smooth and glistening with a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm submucosal mass grossly consistent with a. submucosal lipoma. There is a moderate amount of endoscopy tattooing adjacent to the polypoid mass. Sectioning through the attached fat reveals multiple tan-pink rubbery lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted as follows: l- proximal resection margin; 2- distal resection margin; 3-9- entire mass with underlying fat and possible inked serosa; 10- mesenteric resection margin closest to mass; 11- submucosal lipoma; 12- appendix; 13- ileocecal valve; 14-18- multiple whole lymph nodes; 19-20- one bisected lymph node in each; 21- multiple whole lymph nodes. MICROSCOPIC EXAM DIAGNOSIS: Colon, right, hemicolectomy: INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA, LOW GRADE (MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED), (SEE CANCER SUMMARY) ALL MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR  23 LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (O/23)
