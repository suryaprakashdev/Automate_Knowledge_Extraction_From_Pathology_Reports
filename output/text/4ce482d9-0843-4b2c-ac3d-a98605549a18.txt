SPECIMENS: A. MEDIAL UPPER POLE CYST WALL B. RIGHT POSTERIOR UPPER POLE TUMOR SPECIMEN(S): A. MEDIAL UPPER POLE CYST WALL B. RIGHT POSTERIOR UPPER POLE TUMOR GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. MEDIAL UPPER POLE CYST WALL Received in formalin in a container labeled with patient name designated "a. medial upper pole cyst wall" are multiple fragments of beige-tan soft tissue measuring 1.9 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette A1.. B. RIGHT POSTERIOR UPPER POLE TUMOR Received fresh labeled with patient name designated "b. right posterior upper pole tumor" is a portion of kidney with attached peri-renal fat weighing 105 gm and measuring overall, 12 x 7.5 x 3.0 cm. A grossly obvious mass protrudes from a ring of normal appearing kidney. The surface of the mass demonstrates an area of disruption measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The lesion measures 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm.  The normal kidney measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is inked as follows: surface of the Iesion-black, normal kidney margins-blue, peri-renal fat-yellow. Cut section of the lesion shows a well encapsulated red-brown centrally hemorrhagic cut surface. The mass lies directly adjacent to the normal kidney margin at distance of 0.1 cm. Gross photographs are taken. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1-B6: remainder of the lesion and surgical margin B7: lesion and normal kidney B8: portion of normal kidney with attached peri-renal fat  B9: sections of peri-renal fat overlying tumor. DIAGNOSIS: A. KIDNEY, UPPER POLE CYST WALL, EXCISION: - BENIGN RENAL CORTICAL CYST B. KIDNEY, RIGHT POSTERIOR UPPER POLE, PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY: -PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (2.8 CM) EXTENDING TO THE INKED ASPECT. SEE COMMENT SYNOPTIC REPORT - KIDNEY (PARTIAL OR RADICAL) Specimens Involved Specimens: B: RIGHT POSTERIOR UPPER POLE TUMOR Specimen Type: Partial nephrectomy Without adrenal gland Laterality: Right Tumor Site: Upper pole Focality: Unifocal Tumor Size (largest tumor if multiple): Greatest dimension: 2.8cm Additional dimensions: 2.5cm x 2cm Macroscopic Extent of Tumor: Tumor limited to kidney WHO CLASSIFICATION Papillary renal cell carcinoma 8260/3 Histologic Grade (Fuhrman Nuclear Grade): G3: Nuclei very irregular, approximately 20 u; nucleoli large and prominent.  Invasion of Vascular/Lymphatic: Absent Perinephric Tissue Invasion:  Absent Margins: Cannot be assessed Adrenal Gland: Not present Regional Lymph Nodes: None sampled Additional Findings: Incidental small cortical glandular proliferation (0.2 cm) best classified as papillary adenoma.

Pathological Staging (pTNM): pT 1a N X M X Comment(s): Representative sections of the main lesion and the incidental adenoma were reviewed by Dr. who concurs with this assessment. Both carcinoma and adenoma share a similar immunophenotype-CK 7  positive, EMA positive, CD 56 negative supporting the above diagnosis. As per the surgeon (Dr.), the lesion was entirely removed with intraoperative visualization of the intact tumor capsule. However, the specimen received in the pathology department exhibited a disrupted capsule at the parenchymal resection side, possibly an ex vivo artifact. Clinical-operative correlation is essential. Close follow-up is indicated. CLINICAL HISTORY:  None given PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right kidney mass
