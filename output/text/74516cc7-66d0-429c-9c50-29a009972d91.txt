F: Sections of the bladder and prostate show a poorly differentiated, invasive urothelial carcinoma. The tumor cells grow in trabeculae and display a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and a high mitotic rate. Nuclear pleomorphism is moderate and nuclear irregularities are present. The chromatin is coarsely clumped with areas of irregular clearing with moderate to sparse eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cell borders are indistinct. Tumor cells deep invade the prostatic parenchyma approaching to within 0.1 cm of the inked prostatic capsular radial margin (F17). G-V: See final microscopic-diagnosis. Signature Line Signed by: ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE GROSS DESCRIPTION: A: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Right uretheral margin" (sic). It consists of a 0.3 cm length of ureter 0.5 cm in diameter. Entirely submitted in one cassette for frozen section. B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Left uretheral margin' (sic). It consists of a 0.3 cm length of ureter 0.2 cm in diameter.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Inferior urethral margin." It consists of a 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, tan tissue fragment. Entirely submitted for frozen section. E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Posterior urethral margin." It consists of a 1 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm, tan tissue fragment. Entirely submitted for frozen section. F: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Bladder & prostate." It consists of a 20 x 13.5 x 5.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen. The peritoneum measures 17 x 12 cm and is grossly uninvolved. The bladder measures 5 x 5 x 3 cm. The prostate measures approximately 2 3 x 3 x 3 cm to palpation but is firmly attached to a 5 x 4 x 3 cm, palpable mass at the neck of the bladder. The specimen is opened along its. anterior surface to reveal the following: A 5 x 4 x 3 cm, lobulated, exophytic mass that is located in the portion of the bladder inferior margin. A portion of the mass detached from the specimen upon opening. The surface of the mass displays stellate ulceration and necrosis. The mass is located at the interface between the bladder and the prostate. Serial section reveals a flat demarcation between the mass and the prostate. The cut surface of the mass is firm and white-tan and displays an interface with the prostate parenchyma. The prostatic parenchyma is not lobulated; however, fine, protruding, yellow-white, punctate areas are present in the right lobe of the prostate. The prostatic urethra measures 1.5 cm in length and is grossly involved. The verumontanum is excavated. The uninvolved bladder mucosa is purple and edematous. No other lesions are noted. The uninvolved wall is 0.6 cm in thickness. The maximum depth of invasion is 1.1 cm. The bladder wall thickness in the area of invasion cannot be measured as it occurs in the bladder neck. Representative sections are submitted in 25 cassettes (see summary). G: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled *Posterior urethral margin."

EFS:  Posterior urethral margin:. - carcinoma in situ in periurethral glands GFS:  Posterior urethral margin:. - no carcinoma in situ HFS: Anterior urethral margin:  carcinoma in situ in periurethral glands IFS: Lateral urethral margin:. - no carcinoma in situ DIAGNOSIS COMMENT: On specimen D, the frozen section shows a focus of carcinoma in situ in a gland. This is not present on the permanent section. There is a low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma in the region of the bladder neck and mid region of the bladder.. A morphologically distinct high grade tumor arises in the bladder neck and prostatic urethra. This is a high grade tumor that invades the prostate and bladder neck. The low grade tumor is noninvasive..
