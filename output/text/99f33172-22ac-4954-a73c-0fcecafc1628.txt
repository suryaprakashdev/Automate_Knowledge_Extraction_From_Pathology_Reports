The radial resection margin is inked blue and the apecimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 10 cm from the proximal margin and five cm from the distal margin. The tunor measures five cm in length and 4.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals an ulcerating tumor invading through the bowel wall into the pericolonic fat and extending to the puckered serosa, to a depth of 2 Cm, which is 4 cm from the closest xadial margin. The remaining mucosa shows normal folds and no gross abnormality..  Pericolic and peri-colonic adipose. tissue is submitted for lymph node dissection, and all possible aodes axe submitted. Representative sections are submitted. tps is subnitted.. Summary of sections:  PM - proximal margin DM - distal margin RM - radial margin PIN-grossly positive lymph nodes aubjacent tc . uninvolved mucosa LN - lymph nodes 2}. The apecimen is received fresh, labeled "Gallbladder" and consists of a. green and purple gallbladder measuring 8.2 x 4.2 x 2.5cm. The surface of the gallbladder is green purple and smooth.. It is opened to reveal. two black green angulated granular calculi measuring 1.4 cm and 1.5 cm in greatest dimenaion, with green black viscid bile.. It alao reveals a green yellow. velvety mucosa with a wall measuring up to 0.2 cm..  Representative sections including the cystic duct margin are submitted.. Summary of sections: M - cystic duct margin undesignated 3). The apecimen is received in formalin, labeled "Lymph node of callot" and consists of a single lymph node measuring 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node. is bisected and entirely submitted. Summary of sections: LN - lymph node 4). The apecimen is received in foxmalin , labeled "Hepatic artery lymph node" and consists of a single lymph node measuring 3.8 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm.

Pag Summary of sections:. LN - lymph node 5).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left fallopian tube and. ovary" and consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary.  The fallopian tube measures 2.5  cm in length and averages 0.8 cm in dianeter. The external suxface of the tube is pink tan and smooth with a normal fimbriated end. Cut section through the tube reveals a pinpoint lumen.. The attached Ovary measurea 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm.  The external surface is white-tan and cerebriform. Cut section through the ovary reveals a white-tan appearance. Representative sections are submitted.

The fallopian tube measures 2.5 cm in length and averages 0.6 cm in diameter. The external surface of the tube is pink tan and amooth with a normal fimbriated end. There are several paratubal cysts identified which measure up to 0.A x 0.3 cm in greatest dimensions, Cut section through the tube xeveals a pinpoint Iumen.
