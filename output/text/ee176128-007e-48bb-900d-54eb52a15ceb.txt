Date Received Outpatient Case# Date Reported: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Diagnosis: A. - B.) LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY LYMPH NODE, LUMPECTOMY AND SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY: - Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3. - Tumor size: 6.8 cm in diameter.. * Ductal carcinoma in situ (Dcis), high nuclear grade, with comedo necrosis. - Dcis is extensive, involving an area larger than the area involved by. invasive carcinoma. - The inferior lumpectomy margin is involved by DCis (see comment for. additional information concerning margins). LCD6-3 - Two lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/2). 5|o/3 PATHOLOGY TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3. Type and grade (in situ): Dcis, high nuclear grade. N83 Primary tumor: pT3. ts Regional ymph nodes: pNo(i-)(sn).. Distant metastasis: Not applicable.. Stage: IIB. C Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified. 50 Margin status: Margin involved by carcinoma. See comment. COMMENT: The invasive carcinoma has an irregular, elongated multilobulated NBS contiguration, with possible small satellite tumor nodules at the periphery of the tumor. In some areas, the gross appearance of the tumor was subtle, and in other. areas where invasive carcinoma was present, no grossly demonstrable tumor could 85s/ be seen. The tumor size of 6.8 cm in diameter is based on the distribution of invasive tumor in the specimen. Dcis is extensively present in association with invasive. carcinoma. The inferior margin is involved by DciS, in both the medial and lateral aspects of the specimen. In addition, DCiS is identified 0.1 cm from the anterior and superior.

Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT margins. Carcinoma is identified 0.5 cm from the lateral and medial margins. Invasive. carcinoma is not identified at any margin, but is identified 0.2 cm from the anterior and superior margins.. In some areas, the invasive carcinoma has features suggestive of neuroendocrine. differentiation (nuclear molding, relatively scant cytoplasm, inconspicuous nucleoli), and this impression is supported by positive staining for synaptophysin in tumor. cells. pw TSs,O?o Mewroinelorrin emcnnor Tunr1s 1O0% duc$l Bce Intradepartmental consultation has reviewed representative slides, and concurs with the above diagnosis.

Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Progesterone receptor: 60% positive cells. HER2: INC 0. Ki-67: 25% positive cells. Signed by Source of Specimen: A. Sentinel lymph node;Left axillary? B. Breast lumpectomy;Left Clinical History/Operative Dx: Malignant neoplasm of breast (female) unspecified sile. Gross Description: A.Part A is sentinel node #1, left axillary. Received in formalin is a 2.4 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm portion of. fatty soft tissue. Examination reveals a lymph node, 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. The lymph node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation in A1 with a sentinel node protoco! performed. A second lymph node is 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. This lymph node is bisected and submitted in A2.. Routine histology and sentinel node protocol is performed on blocks A1 and A2.. B. Part B is left breast mass. Initially received in the fresh state for possible Oncogenotyping studies is a. 178 gram yellow-tan portion of fibrofatty sofl tissue. 9.3 cm superior-inferior, 9.3 cm medial-lateral, and 4 8 cm posterior-anterior. An overlying ellipse of wrinkled.tan skin is 7.5 x 1.1 cm. Two sets of sutures are present: a double long suture marks lateral and a double short suture marks superior.
