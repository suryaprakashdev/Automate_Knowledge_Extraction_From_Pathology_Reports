E.  LABELED DIAPHRAGMATIC TUMOR: MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, EPITHELIAL,  TUBULOPAPILLARY TYPE, INVADING M FIBROCOLLAGENOUS TISSUE AND FOCALLY THE SKELETAL MUSCLE. G. LEVEL IV LYMPH NODE, EXCISION: FOUR LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY. H. RIB, RESECTION: FOR GROSS ONLY. cOmmENr: The tumor present in specimens B, C and F is formed by epithelial. cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm round nucleus and prominent nucleoli. These cells are arranged in glands and form papilla as well as nests.  The immunohistochemical studies confirm the. diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma: the tumor cells are positive for. calretinin, thrombomodulin , wT-1, cytokeratin and negative for B72.3, cEA, and BEREP-4.

C. Received fresh labeled right lung is a right extrapleural pneumonectomy x 15.0 x 4.0 cm.weighing 800 gm.tota1.  The parietal pleura is attached at the superior part of the specimen and measures 30 x 15 cm, with 0.2 cm thickness.  The thoracic, diaphragmatic, and mediastinal. surface of the lung is almost entirely covered by granular, tan indurated nodules.  The lung is serially sectioned. The lung's parenchyma is soft, red, and free of tumor, except at the mediastinal aspect of the lung where the tumor appears to invade the lung parenchyma. The parietal pleura also shows multiple nodules, the largest measuring 10 x 3 x 3 cm and appears to invade the lung. Summary of sections: 1&2-sections from the tumor, 3-bronchial margin with two lymph nodes,. -vesseis"with one nilar Iymph node,. 5-three possible lymph nodes, 6 -three possible lymph nodes, 7-tumor to lung parenchyma, 8&9-tumor and parietal pleura. 10-tumor. D. Received fresh labeled level 8 lymph node is a piece of tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified measuring 0.5 and 0.7 cm. Summary of sections: D1-- one lymph node bisected, D2- one lymph node bisected. E. Received fresh labeled level 9 lymph node is one lymph node measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in one cassette. F.  Received fresh labeled tumor diaphragmatic are multiple fragments of fibroadipose tissue with fibrous white granular tissue aggregating to S.0 x 5.0 x 1.0 cm. Representative sections are submitted in two cassettes.. G. Received fresh are two anthrocotic lymph nodes measuring 1.2 and 0.5 cm. Summary of cassettes: 1- one lymph node bisected, 2- one lymph node. H. Received fresh labeled ribs are six fragments of bone submitted for Dr.. study.
