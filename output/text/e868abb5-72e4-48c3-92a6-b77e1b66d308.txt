Sentinel lymph node #1, biopsy: One lymph node with metastatic carcinoma (1/1). B. Breast, left, mastectomy: Invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma, size 2.2 cm in greatest dimension; negative margins of excision. C. Breast, left nipple core, biopsy: Negative for malignancy. D. Lymph nodes, left axilla, lymph node dissection: Nine negative lymph nodes (0/9). Microscopic Description: Invasive carcinoma: Histologic type: Lobular (E-cadherin negative).
