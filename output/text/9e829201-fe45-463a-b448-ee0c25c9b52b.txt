Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 653 gm modified radical mastectomy specimen. The specimen is oriented with a short suture designating the superior margin and a long suture designating lateral margin. The specimen measures 18.5 cm from superior to inferior, 22.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 3.9 cm from anterior to posterior. There is an attached 9.6 x 7.9 x 1.5 cm axillary tail. On the anterior surface is a 18.0 x 8.0 cm tannish brown ellipse of skin with a 4.0 x 4.5 cm areola and a 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm raised nipple. The nipple-areolar complex reveals no evidence of ulceration or retraction.. The specimen is inked as follows: superior edge - blue; inferior edge - green; posterior - black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 11 slices to reveal a rubbery, irregularly shaped, white-tan, 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm mass with a granular cut surface in slices 3 through 5. A clip is identified in slice 3. The  mass is 0.5 cm from the posterior margin and widely free (>2 cm) from the  anterior superior and anterior inferiormargins. The remainder of the specimen consists of approximately 30% dense gray-white fibrous breast parenchyma and 70% Iobulated yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses or nodules are grossly. identified. Sectioning through the axillary tail reveals multiple tan-brown, rubbery lymph nodes ranging from 0.3-2.5 cm in greatest dimension.
