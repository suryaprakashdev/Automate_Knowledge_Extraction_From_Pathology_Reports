Comment: Three distinct masses were identified in the mastectomy specimen, all located in the lower outer quadrant. The two larger masses (#1 and #2) are histologically similar, showing a poorly differentiated epithelial component as well as a mesenchymal component displaying marked pleomorphism and fascicles of spindled cells. Staining of these biphasic. areas show strong pancytokeratin positivity in the epithelial component while the spindled areas are negative. The histologic and immunohistochemical pattern is consistent. with metaplastic carcinoma with a malignant sarcomatous component (carcinosarcoma).  While mass #1 and #2 are morphologically similar, they are not grossly or histologically contiguous. The third mass (#3) is a different histologic type (adenoid cystic carcinoma). It is also grossly separate from masses #1 and #2. As. per the AJcc Cancer Staging Manual, the grade and stage of multiple tumors of different histologic grade and/or type is based on the largest tumor Page 1 Continued on Next Page FOR OFPICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974

Pathology Report Patient: Specimen #: CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: F diagnosed with right breast IDc, stage 2 ER/pR weakly positive Her2 1+, that presents for preoperative evaluation prior to planned right mastectomy with SLNB. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Operative Findings: Post-operative Diagnosis:. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name. A: lesignated "Right Axillary Sentinel Node 1 and #2 Right. portion of yellow-tan soft tissue. Sectioning reveals two pink-tan lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm and 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. ~Each lymph node is trisected to reveal a pink-tan cut surface that is otherwise unremarkable. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows. first described lymph node. A2: second described iymph node. B. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name designated "Right Axillary Sentinel Node #3" and. lymph node is trisected to reveal an unremarkable cut surface. The specimen is entirely submitted in two cassettes.. C. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's. name : designated "Right Breast" and consists of a right. mastectomy oriented with a short stitch superior and long stitch lateral. The specimen measures 21.0 cm from medial to lateral, 21.0 cm from superior to inferior and 4.0 cm anterior to posterior. The darkly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 6.2 x 4.5 cm and displays a centrally located everted nipple measuring 1.0 cm in diameter. No follows: deep margin = black superior surface of the lower outer quadrant = blue. Upon sectioning the cut surface is composed predominantly of yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue admixed with approximately 20% dense pink-white fibrous tissue which is predominantly located in the central breast. discrete masses are identified in the lower outer quadrant.
