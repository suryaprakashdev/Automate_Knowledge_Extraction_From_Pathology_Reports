The lymph node is bisected to reveal tan pink. homogenous cut surface. Touch preparation is made. The specimen is submitted in toto in one. cassette. B.  SENTINEL LYMPH NODE LEFT AXILLA #2 Received fresh are two pieces of tan pink soft tissue measuring 0.4x0.4x0.3cm. each. One of them is recognized as lymph node which is bisected. Touch preparations are made. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette. C.  SENT!NEL LYMPH NODE #3 Received fresh is one lymph node measuring 1.3x0.8x0.3cm. It is bisected. Touch preparations are made. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette. D. WIDE EXCISION LEFT BREAST Received fresh is an oriented portion of firm breast tissue measuring 7.5x7x4.5cm. The specimen is inked and sectioned to reveal a 3.3x2.6x2.5cm. white firm tumor mass, located 0.5cm. from the posterior margin, 1.5cm. from superior margin, 0.4cm. from the medial margin, 0.7cm. from the inferior margin. One section from the tumor is submitted for tissue procurement. A separate white nodule measuring 0.3cm. in diameter is located 1.2cm. from the main tumor mass. This nodule is 1.1cm. from the medial margin. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1-D4: tumor mass with adjacent margin, representative D5: separate nodule in toto. D6-D9: representative sections from normal looking breast tissue E. ADDITIONAL DEEP MARGIN Received in formalin is an unoriented portion of breast tissue measuring 2.2x2.5x1.5cm. The specimen is inked and serially sectioned to reveal tan yellow lobulated cut surface. No gross lesion is identified. Representatives are submitted in two cassettes.  ADDITIONAL MEDIAL MARGIN Received in formalin is one fragment of tan yellow to pink soft to firm tissue measuring 2.7x2x1.5cm. The specimen is inked and serially sectioned to reveal tan fibrotic cut surface. No gross lesion is identified. The specimen is submitted in toto in two cassettes. Gross Dictation: Pathologist.
