8. Left kidney, total nephrectomy: - High grade renal cell carcinoma, papillary type II, 6.7 cm.. - Tumor invades through the kidney into the perirenal fat.. - Vein invasion is identified. - Vascular and ureteral margins with no tumor seen.. - pTNM: T3a Nx Mx Note: Immunohistochemical stains performed with good positive and negative controls show tumor cells focally positive for RCC, CK19 and. vimentin. They are negative for CD10, keratin903, CK5/6 and CD117. This profile is consistent with papillary carcinoma of kidney. These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the immunohistochemistry laboratory at the These tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food. and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

It consists of a soft yellow-tan irregular fibrofatty tissue fragment measuring 3 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is sectioned to show a soft yellow-tan fibrofatty cut surface with no masses present. No obvious palpable lymph nodes present. Entirely submitted in cassettes 5A-5B. Source of Tissue: 6. Labeled #6, "retroperitoneal lymph nodes' Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "retroperitoneal lymph nodes". It consists of two soft yellow-tan irregular fibrofatty tissue fragments measuring 4 x 3 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.

Labeled #7, "left ureter, stitch marks distal end" Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "left ureter, stitch marks distal end". It. consists of a soft tan-pink tubular tissue measuring 10.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The outer surface is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to show a smooth tan-pink cut surface with no obvious papillary structures noted. Representative sections are submitted in 7A-7E. Designation of Sections: 7A- distal resection margin, 7B- proximal resection margin, 7C-7E- random sections taken every 5 cm from distal to proximal ************************************************************************ Source of Tissue: 8. Labeled #8, "left kidney, stitch marks area of gross tumor protruding outside of kidney" Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "left kidney, stitch marks area of gross tumor protruding outside of kidney". It consists of a kidney with surrounding perinephric fat weighing a total of 290 grams and measuring 13.5 x 9.5 x 5.5 cm. The orientation suture is identified. The attached ureter measures 9.5 cm in. length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The ureter is opened to reveal a smooth tan-pink mucosal lining with no ulcerations or polyps present. The kidney is bisected to show a 6.7 x 5.5 x 5 cm ill-defined fleshy papillary tumor located predominantly at the superior and mid pole aspect of the specimen. The sutured area and surrounding fat margin closest to tumor are inked green. The ureteropelvic junction appears unremarkable. The anterior pole  and approximately 60% of the renal pelvis also appears unremarkable. The tumor comes within less than 0.1 cm of the closest capsule. Tissue submitted to tumor bank and representative sections are submitted in

Designation of Sections: 8A- urethral and vascular margins, 8B- additional. random section of ureter, 8C- ureteropelvic junction, 8D-8E- protruding section of tumor through outside of kidney, 8F-8H- tumor with closest. surrounding capsule, 8I-8J- tumor with adjacent uninvolved renal pelvis Procedures/Addenda AddendumDate Ordered: Status Date Complete. By: Date Reported Addendum Diagnosis Because of patient' s history of thyroid cancer, at the request of , the renal lesion was stained with antibodies TTF-1, thyroglobulin and pan keratin. Positive and negative control slides are satisfactory. Tumor is positive for keratin and negative for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin. The diagnosis of kidney cancer is unchanged.
