Epididymis and spermatic cord segment are identified. At gross sections a well defined solid tumour of 7 x 6,5 x 3,5 cm is identified, with hemorrhagic. and whitish areas, that represents 9o% of the testicular volume. TESTE (ORCHIECTOMY): - DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LINFOMA WITH A HIGH PROLIFERATIVE INDEX Histological examination shows a testicular parenchyma infiltrated by an atypical lymphoid proliferation, showing extense areas of necrosis. The tumor is constituted by layers of large atypical immunoblastic cells which. replace the practical totality of the testicle. The tumor is intensely positive for CD20, CD79a, BCL2, MUM1, with heterogeneous expression of BCL6 and is negative for CD10, CD3 and CD5. The neoplastic cells show Kappa light chain restriction. There is a very scarce intratumoral T-cell reactive lymphoid infiltration CD3 and CD5positive. The Ki67proliferation index is 100%. W 12/15
