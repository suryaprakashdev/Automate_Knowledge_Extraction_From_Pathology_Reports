Metastatic carcinoma in 1/23 axillary lymph nodes (See microscopic description) pT2N1 CLINICAL. INFORMATION: Right breast cancer. GROss DESCRIpTION: The specimen is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name and "Right breast mastectomy". It consists of a right rnodified mastectomy specimen measuring 24.0 x 20.0 x 5.2 cm. A suture is noted indicating the axillary tail. The overlying.skin measures 14.5 x 8.0 cm. The nipple is mobile and everted. An underlying mmass is palpable in the 6 o'ciock position. The deep (fascial) margin is inked black and the rernaining margins are inked yellow. The axillary tissue measures 11.0 x 6.5 x 2.0 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are palpable within it measuring from 0.5 cm to 1.7 crm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are dissected, proceeding from the breast toward the axilla. The specimen is serially sectioned at closely spaced intervals revealing a firm, poorly circumscribed, white and focally hemorrhagic mass measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm located in the inferior aspect of the specimen (6 o'clock position). The mass comes to within 0.8 cm of the skin and 3.0 cm of the deep margin. A second firm, well circumscribed mass measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 is also identified located located 0.8 cm from the skin, 2.4 cm from the deep margin and 2.0 cm from the previously described mass, superiorly. The parenchyma superior and lateral to both masses is firm, Iobulated and gritty over an area measuring 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. The remaining tissue is cornposed of a rnoderate amount of breast tissue and a moderate amount of yellow fatty tissue. Representative sections are submitted in 37 cassettes labeled A1-A37. Please note: The specimen was placed in formalin at LEGEND: A1-A3 = Nipple A4 = Deep margin closest to main mass A5 = Main mass with closest skin A6-A8 = Main mass A9-A10 = Smaller mass A11 = Smaller mass with closest skin A12 = Deep margin closest to smaller mass Page l of 3
