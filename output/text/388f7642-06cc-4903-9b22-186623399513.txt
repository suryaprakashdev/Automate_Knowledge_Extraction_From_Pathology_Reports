CUonsp/slu tyype 83i7|3 C64.9 Surgical Pathology Report n 9/24|L3 Diagnosis: A: Right kidney, nephrectomy - Renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type, nuclear grade 2 (of 4), tumor size 6.0 cm in greatest dimension, tumor confined to kidney, surgical margins free of tumor - Tiny renomedullary interstitial cell tumor, 2 mm, in medullary pyramid - Portions of renal artery, vein and ureter with no tumor seen B: Hilar lymph node, removal - No tumor seen in one lymph node (0/1) Clinical History: The patient is a year-old with a right renal mass. Gross Description: Received are two appropriately labeled containers. Container A: Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: laparoscopic nephrectomy Side of specimen: right. Size and weight of specimen: 450 grams, 15.5 x 9.0 x 7.0 cm Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent Tumor description/site: circumscribed, tan/orange with focal hemorrhage and present in the lower pole Tumor size: 6.0 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: confined to the lower pole but expanding the capsule Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: tumor grossly does not involve Gerota' s fascia: tumor grossly does not involve Renal vein: tumor grossly does not involve Ureter: tumor grossly does not involve Other organs: tumor grossly does not involve Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: negative, less than 0.1 cm from the anterior surface

Renal vein: negative Renal artery: negative. Ureter: negative Description of kidney away from tumor: grossly unremarkable; no cysts or nodules present Lymph nodes (hilar): none identified Other significant findings: none Tissue submitted for special investigations: none Block summary:. A1 - ureter, vascular, tangential margins of resection A2,A3 - tumor expanding renal capsule A4 - tumor and overlying pelvic urothelium A5 - tumor and adjacent renal parenchyma. A6 - tumor and anterior margin closest approach A7 - sample from hilar fat A8 - representative of upper pole, normal appearing kidney A9 - 0.5 cm solid white nodule located in the central renal parenchyma Container B is additionally labeled "hilar lymph node." It consists of a 2.9 x 2.4 x 0.6 cm aggregate of fibrofatty tissue containing a solitary 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm lymph node candidate. The lymph node is sectioned and entirely submitted in block B1. The remainder of the fat is submitted as block B2. Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. Histologic tumor type/subtype: renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type Histologic grade (if applicable): grade 2 (of 4) Tumor size (greatest dimension): 6.0 cm. Extent of tumor invasion:. Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: absent Gerota' s fascia: absent. Renal vein: absent Ureter: absent Venous (large vessel): absent Lymphatic (small vessel): absent Histologic assessment of surgical margins:. Perirenal adipose tissue: free of tumor Gerota' s fascia: free of tumor

Renal vein: free of tumor  Renal artery: free of tumor Ureter: free of tumor Adrenal gland: absent Lymph nodes: no tumor seen in one lymph node (0/1). Other significant findings: a tiny renomedullary interstitial cell tumor, 2 mm (Notation added This is a non-malignant tumor, M8966/0). DQ.PRirtveatment Iw 8/31r 30ft3
