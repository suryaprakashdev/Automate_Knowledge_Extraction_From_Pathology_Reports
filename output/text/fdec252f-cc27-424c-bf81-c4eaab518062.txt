PAGE 2 RUN DATE: RUN TIME: Specimen Inquiry RUN USER: User : PATIENT: (Continued) SPEC #: cOmment(S) (Continued) Perineural Invasion: Not identified. Tumor Deposits: Present (number of deposits: 3) Pathologic Staging: Primary Tumor: pT4a Regional Lymph Nodes: pN2a Number examined: 33 Number involved: 4 Distant Metastasis: Not applicable GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen in formalin is right colon with attached terminal ileum and appondix. right hemicolectomy. The colon measures 25 cm in length by 3 cm in diameter. the small bowel measures 7.5 cm in length by 2 cm in diameter. and the appandix measures 10 cm in length by 1 cm in diameter. The closest radial margin is 5 cm. 3.5 cm distal to the ileocecal valvo there is a nearly circumferential ulcerating partially obstructing mass measuring 3 cm in length by 4.5 cm in width. At the distal end of this there is an associated polyp resection.  Cut section through the ulcerated mass reveals hard pinkish-tan tissue infiltrating through the wall into the overlying subserosa. The remainder of the mucosa throughout the colon and small bowel appears normal. There is one grossly enlarged subserosal lymph node measuring up to 3 cm in diameter containing hard white tissue with central necrosis which is soft and pasty. Other lymph nodes vary from small and rubbery to slightly onlarged. There is one slightly enlarged firm lymph node submitted separate from the intact specimen. Sections are submitted as follows: 1 proximal terminal ileum margin of resection 2 distal colon margin of resection 3 appendix 4-7 mass in colon grossly enlarged lymph node and separately submitted lymph node 8 9-14 - remainder of subserosal lymph nodes A portion of the colon mass has been processed with tumor tissue banking protocol. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The slides are examined and ovaluated. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Specimen processed for tissue banking per protocol. ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **
