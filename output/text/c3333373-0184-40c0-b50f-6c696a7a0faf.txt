SENTINEL #2, LEFT AXILLA LEVEL I, BIOPSY:S - ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE (O/1). 3) LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3, LEFT AXILLA LEVEL I, BIOPSY:S - METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING ONE OUT OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1). - NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION SEEN. 4) BREAST, LEFT, TOTAL MASTECTOMY: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, NOS TYPE, HISTOLOGIC GRADE III/III (SLIGHT OR NO TUBULE FORMATION).  NUCLEAR GRADE II/III (MODERATE VARIATION IN) SIZE AND SHAPE), MEASURING 2.5 CM, GROSSLY. - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) IS ALSO IDENTIFIED, SOLID TYPE WITH INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE AND MODERATE NECROSIS. - LOBULAR INVOLVEMENT BY DCIS IS PRESENT.S - THE DCIS CONSTITUTES <= 25% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR MASS, AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH AND AWAY  FROM THE INVASIVE COMPONENT. - THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS LOCATED NI THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT AND CENTRAL AREA. - THE DCIS IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT AND CENTRAL AREA.S - NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE NIPPLE BY EITHER IN SITU OR INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED. - VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. - NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE SURGICAL MARGINS BY BITHER INVASIVE OR IN SITU CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED. ** Continued on next page ** 1cs-0-3 1 carckoma, lifi1fraHty duct, Nos 85ov13 Site: breest, Nos Cs0.J 10/21f

- NO SKIN INVOLVEMENT BY CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED. - THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE SHOWS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES, STROMAL FIBROSIS, ADENOSIS AND FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES. - RESULTS OF SPECIAL STAINS (ARE AS FOLLOWS: Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed tissue with the following results for invasive carcinoma (block 4 T 11): ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (6F11, 95% nuclear staining with moderate intensity PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (1E2; 60% nuclear staining with moderate intensity HER2 (HercepTest; - Negative (0 ) Controls are satisfactory. Comment: HercepTestTM ) is an FDA-approved method for assessment of HER2 protein overexpression in breast cancer tissue routinely processed for histological evaluation. The HER2 test results are reported in accordance with the Asco/cAP guideline recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer (J Clin Oncol 2007; 25(1):1-28). 5) LYMPH NODES, LEFT AXILLA LEVELS I AND II, RESECTION: - NINE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/9). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Electronically Signea out'  Special studies: Result Special Stain. Comment NEG-HER2 Gross Description: 1).The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "sentinel node number one level 1 left axilla" and consists of a pink-tan lymph node measuring 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm.

Bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: FSC -- frozen section control 3).The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "sentinel node number three level 1 left axilla" and consists of a tan lymph node measuring 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. Bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: FSC -- frozen section control. 4). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left breast stitch marks. axillary tail" and consists of a breast measuring 21.5 x 17.5 x 4 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 9.5 x 3 cm.  Situated centrally on the skin. measuring 3.4 x 2.5 cm.. A suture demarcates the axillary aspect. The posterior surface of the breast is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a centrally located white-tan firm tumor measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm with extension into upper outer quadrant, and located 1.1 cm from the deep margin. A metal clip marking the previous biopsy site is identified.  Sectioning of the axillary aspect reveals no grossly. identifiable lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted. TPS is taken. Summary of sections: N - nipple NB - nipple base D  deep margin BX - biopsy site with tumor. UIQ - upper inner quadrant LIQ lower inner quadrant UOQ  upper outer quadrant LOQ  lower outer quadrant 5). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "level 1 and 2 lymph nodes left axilla". It consists of a 8 x 8 x 1.5 cm fragment of fibroadipose tissue without orientation.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 1.2 cm. All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN - whole lymph nodes Continued on next page.
