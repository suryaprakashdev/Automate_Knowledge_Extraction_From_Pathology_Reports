The in-situ component shows both urothelial and squamous'cel1 carcinoma differentiation (slide labeled Bl1). Therefore, the tumor is considered urothelial carcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation. xxx [], m.d Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the Resident/Fellow, [ m.D Electronically Signed Out by [] M.D clinical history: The patient is a -year-old female with a history of bladder cancer who undergoes pelvic exenteration.

Part A. is no additional designation. Received fresh and placed in formalin are. 2 elliptical portions of wrinkled brown skin.

depth of 0.4 cm. Sectioning reveals no masses or lesions. A representative section of each piece is submitted in Al. Part B. is further labeled "2. Anterior pelvic exenteration". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a specimen consisting of bladder and uterus which is overall 20 x 11 x 5.5 cm.' The bladder is 10 x 11 x 5.5 cm and covered with Tobulated yellow fibroadipose tissue with cautery artifact. The anterior wall and around the urethral margin is inked blue. There is a small amount of apparent labial tissue adjacent to the urethral margin. The labium is 5 x 3 x 0.4 ^cm_and wrinkled gray-brown and unremarkable. The right ureter js 2.cm 1ong and 2.5 cm in diameter.'The left ureter is 0.6 cm long and 0.6 cm in diameter. After shaving the urethral margin, the bladder is opened along the anterior with a Y-shaped incision, revealing a partially ulcerated, partially fungating mass along the posterior and left wa17 extending across the anterior partially into the right lateral wall. The overall dimensions are 8.5 x 7 cm, with a raised portion up to 1.8 cm above the mucosa. The mass comes within 4 cm of the urethral margin. Sectioning through the left ureter reveals that the mass encases the ureter and extends to the blue inked margin. Sectioning through the posterior wall reveals that the tumor extends to the cervix, with a maximum depth of 3.5 cm. The tumor also extends into the right wall'and comes within 0.1 cm of the inked margin. The uninvolved mucosa is edematous. No 1ymph node candidates are identified in the attached adipose tissue. Gross photographs are taken. Posterior to the bladder is a 9 x 6 cm portion of wrinkled pink-tan mucosa and consists of cauterized tissue. The attached uterus is 5 cm from cornu to cornu 4.8 cm from fundus to lower uterine segment and 3.3 cm from anterior to posterior. The serosa covering the uterus is'glistening red and unremarkable. The left fallopian tube has a white clip. The'left fallopian tube is 8 cm long and_up to 1.2 cm in diameter. The left ovary is 2.5 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm. The right fallopian tube has no clip but is focally disrupted. The length of the distal portion is 7 cm with a circumference of 0.7 cm. The right ovary is 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. The bilateral ovaries are bisected to reveal unremarkable gray firm tissue. The uterus is opened from anterior to posterior to reveal a 3.4 x 0.3 by 0.3 cm endometrial cavity with unremarkable tan 1ining. No masses or lesions are identified in the uterus. Sectioning through the anterior and posterior endomyometrium reveals an endometria1 thickness of less than O.1 cm. The posterior endomyometrium has a maximum thickness of 1.4 cm, and the anterior endomyometrium has a maximum thickness of 2 cm. There is a'single white whorled nodule in the anterior myometrium which is 0.6 cm in greatest diameter. The endocervical canal is 1.8 cm long with unremarkable tan trabeculated mucosa.. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. B1: urethral margin. B2: Left ureter margin. B3: Right ureter margin B4: Labia D5 closest approach to urethral margin. B5: Approach of tumor to urethral margin. 36 and 37 section through 1eft ureter,'bisected. B8 and b9: Section through ureter and'anterior cervix, bisected.
