This staging information is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Comment: Sections of ureter show free floating fragments of renal cell carcinoma within the ureteral lumen without invasion or involvement of the ureteral wall. Clinical History: The is with a left renal mass. Gross Description: Specimen A received is one appropriately labeled container. The specimen label states "left nephroureterectomy. Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: nephroureterectomyleft Size and weight of specimen:180 g,15 x9 x6 cm overall Orientation: The external surfaces of the specimen are inked blue.A 12.2 cm length of ureter is attached to the specimen. Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent Tumor description/site: Grossly the tumor encompasses the entire kidney, and there is no normal-appearing kidney parenchyma identified. The cut surface of the tumor demonstrates a soft, necrotic, fleshy, and friable texture with a white-tan coloration. As the specimen is serially sectioned, plugs of tumor fall out of cavities in what appears to be a dilated renal pelvis. Tumorsize7.9x6.5x5.1cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: confined Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue:Notinvolved by tumor Gerotas fascia: Not involved by tumor

Renal vein: Not involved by tumor Ureter: Not involved by tumor Other organs: not applicable Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: negative Renal vein: negative Renal artery: negative Ureter: negative Description ofkidney away from tumor: There are multiple cysts (l.6 cm greatest dimension) with smooth linings located at the inferior pole of the kidney. The cysts are productive of thin, straw-colored fluid. Lymph nodes (hilar): no lymph nodes are identified Other significant findings: The ureter is serially sectioned and reveals the lumen of the proximal aspect to be filled with a maroon-red sludge-like material. Otherwise, the ureter is grossly unremarkable. Tissue submitted for special investigations: Representative tumor and representative normal renal parenchyma is submitted to tissue procurement.
