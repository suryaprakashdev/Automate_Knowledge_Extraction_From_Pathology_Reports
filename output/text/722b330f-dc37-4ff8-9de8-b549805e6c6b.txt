The lesion is within 2 mn of the inferior soft tissue edge and posterior soft tissue edge. Lesion is also within 2 mm of the deep {lateral! soft tissue edge. The tumor is semi firm and white and well-demarcated. The soft tissue edges are inked green. Representative sections are submitted. Photographs are taken. 10A. Sample of superior edge. 103-c.
