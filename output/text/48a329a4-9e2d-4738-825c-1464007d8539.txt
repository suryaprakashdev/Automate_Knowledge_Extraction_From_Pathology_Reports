Left kidney tumor mass #3, excision: Papillary renal cell carcinoma with capsular disruption and multiple small papillary neoplasms in adjacent kidney; see comment. tcD 63 rcinoyD ,feeycllby renaeeQ 8QJ S.te. lel neey HOS 164.9 QS3|30114 Comment: All three tumor resection specimens contain multiple papillary neoplams. In parts A and F, the dominant tumors are composed of papillary excrescences lined by realatively small cuboidal to low-columnar cells with primarily clear cytoplasm. The epithelial cell nuclei are moderately enlarged and round to oval with small nucleoli. The papillae contain fibrovascular cores, some with prominant foamy macrophages. The histology is that of type I papillary carcinoma. Hemorrhage and psammoma bodies are seen throuphout the lesions. ln part A. at least four additional microfoci of papillary proliferations similar to the dominant mass cell carcinoma are seen in the adjacent grossly normal renal parenchyma. In part F, a l.2 cm dominant papillary renal cell carcinoma is seen in association with three additional microfoci of papillary prolierationsare seen in the adjacent renal parenchyma. In part C, a 0.8 cm dominant mass composed of nests of cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and Page 1 of 3

small round nuclei with prominant nucleoli is seen in association with two microfoci of papillary neoplasia. While the the minute papillary proliferations fall short of the size criterion for the diagnosis of papillary. renal cell carcinoma (they are < 5 mm in diameter) their histolgic resemblence to the definitive foci of papillary renal cell carcinoma and the finding of multifocal papillary renal cell carcinoma suggest that these small lesions may have more in common with papillary carcinoma than with isolated small tumors of the type that are called adenomas. In part F, the renal capsule adjacent to the dominant tumor is disrupted, however, it is not clear that this is tumor capsular penetration as oppsed to artifact associated with specimen handling and transport. Select slides were shown at the departmental and the faculty in attendance concurred with the above diagnoses. Kidney Tumor Synoptlc Comment -Histologic type: Renal cell carcinoma, papillary (chromophil) type (type I). -Grade: 2 -Maximum tumor diameter: 2.7 cm. -Site within kidney: Multifocal. -Renal pelvis: Not present. -Ureter: Not present. -Renal sinus: Not present. -Hilar renal veins: Not present. -Intrarenal veins and lymphatics: Normal, no tumor. -Adrenal gland: Not present. -Capsule/perirenal fat: Tumor does not penetrate capsule. -Hilar lymph nodes (number positive/number of nodes): N/A. -Resection margins: Negative. -Proximity to nearest margin: O.l cm (part A) -Stage: pT1NXMX. Specimen(s) Recelved A:Anterior mass of left kidney B:Jerotas C:Perimass fat D:Left kidney tumor mass #2 E:Perirenal fat F:Left kidney tumor mass #3 Clinical History The patient is a  year-old man with a left renal mass. He undergoes partial nephrectomy Gross Description The specimen is received in formalin in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. Part A is additionally labeled "anterior mass left kidney.* It consists of a single fragment of brown renal. tissue, notable for a single nodular mass protruding from the capsular surface. The specimen measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm. The mass measures 2.7 x 2.4 cm and protrudes above the capsular surface 1.1 cm. The surface of the mass is partially covered by a thin, translucent membrane, which is partially retracted The specimen is unoriented. The kidney resection margin is inked with black ink. The specimen is serially sectioned, revealing a hemorrhagic, partially cystic mass that appears to infiltrate the renal cortex. The mass approaches to within 1 mm of the black-inked margin. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes A1 through A7. Page 2 of 3

Part B is additionally labeled *Gerota's, ink marks area adjacent to mass, suture marks external margin." It consists of an irregular fragment of lobulated, yellow, adipose tissue, measuring 7.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. Opposing sides of the roughly flat tissue fragment are partially epithelialized; one side is inked with purple ink, and the other is marked with a black suture. These represent the sides adjacent to the tumor and external surface, respectively. The inked surface is notable for focal areas of fibrous nodularity. The. sutured surface is glistening, smooth, and unremarkable. The specimen is inked as follows: inked surface is re-inked with blue ink, and the sutured surface is inked with black ink. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassettes B1-B2: Region of slight nodularity in the area of heaviest initial surgical inking.. Part C is additionally labeled "peri-mass fat renal tumor." lt consists of a single discoid fragment of lobulated, yellow, adipose tissue, measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x 1.2 cm. One surface is notable for a roughly circular fragment of fibrous membrane, measuring 3.0 x 2.5 cm. The surface of the membranous structure is smooth, glistening, and without lesions. The membrane area is inked with black ink. The specimen is serially sectioned, revealing unremarkable lobulated, yellow, adipose tissue. A representative section is submitted in cassette C1. Part D is additionally labeled "left kidney mass #2." It consists of a single roughly spherical fragment of tan-brown, soft tissue, measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. The tissue consists of a fragment of renal tissue and capsule surrounding a variegated tan and red-brown mass that projects above the renal surface a distance of O.6 cm. The specimen is not oriented. The surgical margin is inked entirely with black ink. The specimen is serially sectioned, revealing a punctate, cystic, hemorrhagic cut surface with focal areas of bright-yellow material located peripherally. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes D1 through D3. Part E is additionally labeled "prerenal fat." It consists of a single irregular fragment of lobulated, yellow fat and associated gray-white, fibrous membrane as well as some adherent red-brown material, suspicious for clot. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette E1. Part F is additionally labeled "left kidney tumor mass #3." lt consists of three fragments of tissue. The largest fragment is tan/red-brown renal parenchyma, measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. A portion of renal surface with disrupted capsule is present and is notable for a single somewhat dome-shaped lesion, measuring 1.2 x 1.0 cm and projecting approximately 0.3 cm above the renal surface. The lesion is. variegated red-brown and yellow. The surgical margin is inked with black ink. The specimen is serially sectioned, revealing a somewhat granular, tan-yellow lesion that irregularly infiltrates the subjacent renal cortex. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes F1 through F3. The additional two tissue fragments are red-brown and tan, unoriented, irregular tissue, measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. The tissue appears to represent fibrous tissue as well as blood clot. This tissue is entirely submitted in cassette F4. Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all pathology slides. Pathology Resident Pathologist Electronically signed out on( Page 3 of 3
