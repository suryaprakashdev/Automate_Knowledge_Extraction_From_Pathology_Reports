Surgical Pathology Report COMMENT  Intraoperatively, the pancreatic margin shows crushed atypical cells (best seen on FS slides) and tinal pancreatic margin (slide 5A). is negative. 88331x2, 88332x2, 88309, 88304, 88305x4 Clinical Diagnosis and History:. Pancreatic ca Tissue(s) Submitted: 1: FALCIFORM LIGAMENT 2: GALLBLADDER 3: WHIPPLE 4: PROTAL VEIN RESECTION  5: ADDITIONAL PANCREAS MARGIN 6: OMENTUM Gross Description:  Specimen #1 is labeled with the patient name and falciform ligament. Received in formalin is a single piece of glistening piece of  adipose tissue with a moderate amount ot white tibrous tissue measuring 17.3 x 6.4 x 1.8 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to. reveal yellow, glistening adipose tissue with a single band of fibrous tissue. 1A-1B: two pieces each, muscle and ligament, representative Specimen #2 is labeled with the patient name and gallbladder. Received in formalin is an intact gallbladder measuring 7.8 x 3.5 x 1 cm, with the cystic duct margin having a diameter of 0.4 cm. The serosa is tan-purple and smooth with no visible lesions or defects. The specimen is opened to reveal no luminal contents. The mucosa is red-pink and reticulated. No evidence ot cholesterolosis is appreciated. No choleliths are appreciated. The wall thickness measures 0.4 cm. Representative sections are submitted. 2A: cystic duct margin interrupting the sections of gallbladder 2B: multiple pieces, additional representative sections of gallbladder Specimen #3 is received fresh in the frozen room labeled Whipple and consists of an intact Whipple specimen measuring 27.0 cm. in length. The stomach measures 9.7 x 4.3 cm with the wall thickness of 0.7 cm. The duodenum measures 13 x 4.1 cm with a thickness of 0.4 cm. The pancreas measures 7.3 x 4.1 x 3.2 cm. The pancreas is sectioned to reveal a tumor mass measuring 2.8 x 1.9 x 1 cm. The tumor mass grossly approaches the SMV and anterior and superior margins. The tumor is grossly abutting the surgical margin. The tumor does not appear to be extending to the ampulla. The remaining pancreatic parenchyma is unremarkable. Inspection of the peripancreatic fat reveals three lymph nodes. The largest measuring 1.7 cm in greatest diameter. and is grossly positive tor tumor. The mucosa of the stomach of the stomach is tan-pink and unremarkable. The mucosa of the small bowel exhibits a sharp demarcation at the jejunum between viable and non-viable mucosa with non-viable mucosa being deep red and hemorrhagic and the viable being tan-brown with regular folds. The non-viable region extends approximately 7 cm from the distal margin. No gross masses, lesions or defects are appreciated on any of the mucosal surfaces. Inspection of the greater curvature adipose tissue reveals 10 presumptive lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: 3A: one piece, frozen section of bile duct margin 3B: one piece, frozen section of pancreatic margin 3C: one piece, frozen section ot deep bile duct 3D: two pieces, small bowel margin 3E: two pieces, stomach margin. 3F; two pieces, non-viable small bowel 3G: two pieces, viable small bowel 3H: two pieces, stomach 3I-J: multiple pieces each, one lymph node from greater curvature 3K-L: multiple pieces, one lymph node from greater curvature 3M: four pieces, four presumptive lymph nodes. 3N: four pieces, four presumptive lymph nodes 3O-P: one piece each, representative fat from greater curvature 3Q: one piece, ampulla 3R; anterior margin Page 2 of 3

Received in formalin are two fragments of tan-pink tissue with the.  smaller measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm and the larger measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted in entirely.. 4A: multiple pieces, portal vein resection, all Specimen #5 is received fresh labeled additional pancreas margin and consists of a single segment of pancreas measuring 2.6 x. 1.5 x 0.8 cm in thickness. The distal most aspect has been submitted for frozen section. The specimen is entirely submitted labeled: 5A: one piece, frozen section remnant 5B: remaining pancreas, all Specimen #6 is labeled with the patient name, omentum. Received in formalin is a segment of yellow, glistening adipose tissue measuring 36.8 x 14.6 x 1.3 cm. The surface of the omentum does not exhibit any gross nodularity. Sectioning of the omentum. reveals a single focus of fat necrosis measuring 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. Summary of sections: 6A-B:  one piece each, area of fat necrosis 6C-E: one piece each, representative sections of omentum, representative.
