IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAIN WAS PERFORMED ON FORMALIN-FIXED TISSUE WITH THE age HER2 NEGATIVE (0 / 1+) 5% OF INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT COMPLETE MEMBRANOUS STAINING; UNIFORMITY OF STAINING: ABSENT HOMOGENEOUS, DARK CIRCUMFERENTIAL PATTERN: ABSENT Comnent: Controls are satisfactory. s PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu is an the internal domain of the c-erbb-2 oncoprotein (Her2) for. immunohistochemical detection of HeR2 protein overexpression in breast cancer tissue routinely processed for histologic evaluation. The HBR2 test results are reported in accordance with the Asco/cap guidelina recommendations for Her2 testing in breast cancer (J clin Oncol 2007; 25(1) :118-145). The BR and pR rabbit monoclonal antibodies are also FDA. approved. 2. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT AXILLA LEVEL ONE, SUBCAPSULAR: - SIX BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/6). Some of the immunohistochemistry and performance characteristics were determined by tests were devaloned and their They have not been cleared or approved by the Us Food and Drug Administration. The FoA has datermined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of i98s (cLIa : 88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. 2. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL BXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Blectronicaily Signed Out *** Gross Descriotion: 1).The specimen is received fresh labeled, "right breast and axillary contents levels one and two with tags attached" and consists of a breast measuring 19 x 18 x 3 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 11 x 3 cm. Situated centrally on the skin surface is an everted nipple measuring 1 x 1 x 0.6 cm and areola measuring 3 x 3 cm. A suture demarcates the axillary contents which measures 11 x 7 x 3 cm. Two tags are present, designating levels one and two. The posterior surface of the breast is inked black, the anterior blue and the axiilary aspect is inked yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.5 cm diameter mass in the lower outer ** Continued on next page **.
