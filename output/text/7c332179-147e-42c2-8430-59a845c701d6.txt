Pathology Report CORRECTED Report Type .... Pathology Report. Date of Event ... Authored by .... Hosp/Group .... Record Status .... CORRECTED. ADDENDA: Addendum MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING Block 3K: A. HRAS mutation IDENTIFIED (p.Q61K, c.181C>A). B. Mutations in BRAF, NRAS61, KRAS12/13 NOT identified. C. FISH test for RET/PTC rearrangement is pending NOTE: DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing. BACKGROUND: Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (1). BRAF V600E (T1799A) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2, 3). The association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in ~70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency in oncocytic (H?rthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity of these mutations for cancer, BRAF V600E mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid tumors, being found in ~40-50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papillary carcinomas (6). et al.

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: For paraffin-embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the LightCycler platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on ABI3130. DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of  detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal DNA.
