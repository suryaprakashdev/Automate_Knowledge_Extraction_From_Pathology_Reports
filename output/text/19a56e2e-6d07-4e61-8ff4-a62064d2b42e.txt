Date Ordered: Status: Signed Out Date Completed: Addendum Diagnosis RECEIVED FROM Breast Cancer Assay Description Breast Cancer Assay uses RT-PCR to determine the expression of a. panel of 21 genes in tumor tissue. The Recurrence Score is calculated from the gene expression results. The Recurrence Score range is from O-100. Results Breast Cancer Recurrence Score = 6 The findings summarized in the Clinical Experience sections of this report are applicable to the patient populations defined in each section. It is unknown whether the findings apply to patients outside these criteria.. Clinical Experience: Prognosis for node negative, ER-positive patients. The Clinical Validation study included female patients with Stage I or Il, Node Negative, ER-Positive breast cancer treated with 5 years of tamoxifen. Those patients who had a Recurrence Score of 6 had an Average Rate of Distant Recurrence of 5% (95% CI: 3%-7%) Quantitative Single Gene Report.

The HER2:D17Z1 ratio is 1.03. Average HER2 signals per nucleus is 1.8. Average D17z1 signals per nucleus is 1.7. Interpretation The invasive tumor nuclei have no evidence of HER2 gene Amplification (per AScO/CAP guidelines) in this breast Excision specimen. The HER2:D17Z1 ratio is 1.03. This result suggests the tumor has two chromosomes 17 with a Normal HER2 gene copy number. ASCO/CAP reporting guidelines (Wolff et al., Arch Path Lab Med 131: 18-43, 2007): A HER2:D17Z1 ratio less than 1.8 indicates absence of HER2 gene amplification. A HER2;D17Z1 ratio from 1.8 2.2 is equivocal for HER2 Gene amplification.. A HER2:D17Z1 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates HER2 gene Amplification when there are greater than 6 HER2 signals per nucleus. DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance Characteristics determined by It is intended as an.

Adjunct to existing prognostic clinical and pathologic Information for breast cancer patients. This test is not Intended to diagnose or screen for breast cancer. Per ASCO/CAP guidelines, HER2 FISH test results are valid for Non-decalcified paraffin embedded specimens fixed in 10% Neutral buffered formalin between 6 and 48 hours. Results From specimens fixed outside these parameters should be Interpreted accordingly. Consultant Report Date *Performing Site: ORIGINAL REPORT ON FILE IN SURGICAL PATHOLOGY LABORATORY

Clinical. History: The patient is a -year-old female with breast cancer undergoing lumpectomy. Specimens Received: A: Right sentinel node #1. B: Right breast central partial mastectomy; lumpectomy C: Additional tissue from lateral and medial corners of incision Gross Description: The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.. A. The first container is additionally identified as, 'right sentinel node #1'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.4 cm rubbery, bluish discolored lymph node that is bisected and submitted in A1. B. The second container is additionally identified as, 'right breast central partial mastectomy'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 90.2 gm partial mastectomy specimen measuring 7.3 cm from medial to lateral, 7.8 cm from superior to inferior and 3.3 cm from anterior to posterior. There is a 6 x 4.8 cm areola with a 1.3 x 1 cm flat nipple, with a short suture designating the superior pole and a long suture designating the lateral pole. The specimen is

inked as follows: anterior - black posterior - red superior - blue inferior - green medial - yellow lateral - violet The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 9 slices (slice 6 at nipple). There is a solid, white-tan, retroareolar mass located in slices 6-7 measuring 1.9 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm. It is located 2.4 cm from the superior margin, 2.5 cmfrom the lateral margin, 3.0 cm from the inferior margin, 3.3 cm from the medial margin, and 3.5 cm from the deep margin. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1: Medial margin B2: Lateral margin B3-B9: Slice #7, lesion and margins B10-B11: Representative skin and nipple, slice #6 B12: Representative uninvolved, slice #5 B13: Representative uninvolved, slice #8 Tissue fixed for at least 6 hours in 10% NBF and no more than 72 hours.

C. The third container is additionally identified as, 'additional tissue from Iateral and medial corners of incision'. Received fresh and placed in formalin are 2 pieces of skin and subcutaneous tissue. One piece measures 4 x 2.3 x 0.5 cm and has a stitch that designates the medial corner; this margin is inked blue, and the remainder is inked black. The other portion of skin measures 3.8 x 2.8 x 0.8 cm; the deep surface is inked black. The specimens are sectioned and no discrete lesions are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1: Representative sections of piece with stitch C2: Representative section of other piece , M.D. Pathologist Sign Out: 4124
