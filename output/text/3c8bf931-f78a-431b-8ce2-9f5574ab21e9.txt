Type and grade (in situ): Lobular carcinoma in situ. Primary tumor: pT3.. Regiona! lymph nodes: pN2a (5/14 lymph nodes positive). Distant metastasis: pMX. Pathologic stage: IIIA. Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified. Margin status: R0, negative. COMMENT: The tumor size is measured at least 6.5 cm grossly, however, there is a second tumor mass grossly noted that shows similar histology to the large tumor mass grossly noted. On random sections between the two tumor masses, invasive Iobular carcinoma is seen, therefore, these masses are considered to be one large tumor mass rather than two separate masses (overall gross estimate of 14 cm) Results discussed with Dr. Case #: Page 1 Printed: This report continues...

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Regional lymph nodes (pN): pN2a (5/14 iymph nodes POSITIVE) Distant metastasis (pM): pMX. Pathologic stage: IIIA. RECEPTOR STATUS AND HER2/NEU: Estrogen receptors:. POSITIVE (95-100% positive cells, strong intensity). Progesterone receptors:. POSITIVE (90-100% positive cells, strong intensity). Negative (0, scale 0-3+) Her2/neu: Ki-67 proliferative index:. Low (2-5% positive cells). COMMENT: The biomarkers are combined from previous cases and show a similar stalning pattern. The patient had two previous biopsies, however, on. the mastectomy specimen, there are two identified masses, however, there is intervening tumor cells and both tumor masses show a similar histology, therefore, it's felt to represent. one large tumor mass. In addition to the five  macrometastases seen in the fourteen lymph.  nodes, two additional lymph nodes show isolated tumor cells (and are not included in the five positive nodes).. Additional pathologic findings: Apocrine metaplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, usual ductal hyperplasia. . MD, Signed by Source of Speclmen: Right Breast total mastectomy Clinical Historv/Operative Dx:. Right breast cancer. Gross Descrlption: The specimen is labeled right breast modified radical mastectomy and is received without fixative. it. consists of a modified radical mastectomy which weighs 2,220 grams. Overall, the specimen measures 28 x 23 x 6 cm. There is an overlying broad ellpse of brown skin measuring 30 x 19.5 cm. Centrally and. slightly superiorly within the skin, there is a 7.5 cm areola and a protuberant 1.5 cm nipple. The peripheral skin displays five sharply delineated dark brown, smooth, shiny papules. The anterior-superior. margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterlor margin, which consists of smooth facial tissue, is inked black. Axillary tissue is present with at stitch marking the axilla. The axillary tail measures 10 x 5 x 2 cm. In the lower outer quadrant of the breast, there is palpably firm and hemorrhagic breast parenchyma which is very poorly delineated. There is some bright yellow discoloration of the associated fatty tissue. This area of firm fibrous parenchyma involves an area Case #: Page 3 This report continues... (FINAL) Printed: Phone:

Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT measuring 6.5 cm from medlal to lateral, 5.5 cm from superior to Inferior, and up to 3 cm from superficia! to deep. The flbrous tissue is 4 cm from the closest inferlor margin, 12 cm from the closest superior margin, 9 cm from the closest medial margin, and 11 cm from the closest lateral margin. It is 2.5 cm from the closest deep margin, and 2 cm from the closest skin. Representative sections of this tissue are obtained for research purposes. Further examination of the breast reveals scattered moderately dense, tan-white fibrous parenchyma throughout all four quadrants. in the lower outer quadrant of the breast centrally, 5.5 cm lateral to the palpably firm breast tissue, there is an additional ll-defined 2 cm area of moderately dense fibrous tissue with very focal bright yellow discoloratlon of the surrounding fat. This lower outer quadrant fibrous parenchyma is 1.5 cm from the closest margin which is the deep margin. It is 5 cm from the closest lateral margin, and greater than 5 cm from all other margins, except for the skin where it is 1.8 cm from the skin. There are multiple palpable flrm nodes within the axillary portion of the dissection. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1) nipple and tissue just deep to nipple,. A2) representative skin including small papules, A3) sections from medial edge of palpably firm and fibrous tissue, A4-A6) central sections of firm neoplastic tissue submitted from superior to inferior, A7-A8) representative sectlons of lateral edge of fibrous tissue, A9) representatlve section of fibrous tissue from far lateral lower outer quadrant, A10) representative deep margin far lateral lower outer quadrant, A11) representative deep margin central breast underlying palpably firm tissue, A12) representative tissue from upper inner quadrant, A13) representative tissue lower inner quadrant, A14) representative tissue upper outer quadrant, A15) representative sections of lower outer quadrant (in between palpable central tumor and far lateral lower outer quadrant sections),. A16) representative sections of largest 2.7 cm node (grossly suspicious for tumor), A17) single node, bivalved (grossly suspicious for tumor), A18) single node, trisected (grossly suspicious), A19) single node, trisected,. A20) two nodes, inked and bivalved, one possible node intact, A21) one node, inked and bivalved, possible smaller nodes intact, A22-A25) additional sectlons following reexamination for possible lymph nodes. Microscopic Description:. Microscopic sectlons have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. immunohistochemistry was performed with adequate control for OSCAR keratin.
