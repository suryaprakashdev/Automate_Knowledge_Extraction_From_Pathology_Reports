SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 2.8 x 2.4 x 1cm. The specimen is sectioned and two touch. preps are taken. Toto B1-B2 C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh are two tan pink lymph nodes 1.2 x 1 x 0.8cm and 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4cm. Two touch preps are taken. C1: one lymph node C2: one lymph node D. RIGHT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast" is an 1129g, 29 x 24 x 5cm oriented (stitch in axilla) simple mastectomy with 23 x 9cm tan pink skin ellipse with 0.5 cm scar, 3.5cm. from the nipple in the UIQ, and 0.8cm flattened nipple.

The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 14 slices with. nipple in slice 10, revealing a 1.8 x 1.7 x 1.7cm tan white firm well circumscribed mass, 1.4cm from the deep margin in the UOQ of slices 11-12. Also seen is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5cm previous biopsy site with surrounding fat necrosis, 2.4cm from the mass and corresponding to the scar on the skin surface in the. UC of slice 10. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement.

BREAST, LEFT, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION EXCISION: - ATYPICAL LOBULAR HYPERPLASIA (ALH) AND PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 1, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY:E - ONE LYMPH NODE. NO TUMOR SEEN (O/1) C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 2, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY:E - TWO LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/2). NOTE: Cytokeratin AE1/3 stains were performed on B1 and C1 and are negative. D. BREAST,RIGHT, MASTECTOMY: - MULTIFOCAL INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2. - LARGEST TUMOR MEASURES 2.2 CM. - MARGINS, FREE OF TUMOR. - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), MICROPAPILLARY TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE 2, WITH NECROSIS - LOBULAR CARCINOMA iN SITU (LCIS). - SKIN AND NIPPLE, NO TUMOR SEEN. NOTE: The tumor is present in the upper inner and upper outer quadrants with the largest focus of invasive carcinoma measuring 2.2 cm that is associated with previous biopsy site changes. In addition, a few small foci (the largest of the small foci is 0.3 cm) of invasive carcinoma are seen, with one focus associated with previous biopsy site changes. E.
