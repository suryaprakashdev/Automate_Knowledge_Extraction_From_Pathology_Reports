LEft breast, modifIed RaDICal mAstectomy: - Multicentric invasive lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2. Sitt : 1ymph mode, axillay - Tumor size: 3.5 cm. c77.3 - Smaller tumor nodules: 0.1 to 1.2 cm in diameter. - Atypical lobular hyperplasia and atypical ductal hyperplasia. lw - Metastatic carcinoma in nineteen of twenty-one axillary lymph nodes (19/21) 3/5p4 - Largest metastatic focus: 2.5 cm; extranodal extension present. - One of the nodes was previously biopsied. - Mastectomy margins are free of tumor. - Carcinoma is 1 cm from the deep margin, and at least 1 cm from all other margins. PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SUMMARY: Type and grade (invasive): Invasive Iobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2. Primary tumor: pT2(m). Regional Iymph nodes: pN3a. Distant metastasis: Not applicable. Pathologic stage: IIIC. Margin status: Negative. COMMENT: The main tumor mass is Iocated in the 3-4:00 region of the breast, and grossly measures 3.5 cm in diameter. Adjacent to this nodule is a 1.2 cm secondary nodule. A third 0.5 cm nodule is identified in the lower inner quadrant, and small foci of invasive tumor are located in the subareolar breast tissue. The separately submitted lymph node (specimen B) is positive for metastatic carcinoma, and is included in the total Iymph node count above.

Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Source of Specimen: A. Breast;left B. Apical node Clinical History/Operative Dx: Left breast cancer. Gross Description: A. Received fresh labeled "modified radical mastectomy" is a right modified radical mastectomy. specimen. The breast measures 16 cm (medial-lateral) x 15 cm (superior-inferior) x 5 cm. (anterior-posterior), and weighs 538 g. There is an elliptical portion of tan skin measuring 15 x 8 cm, with.  nipple and areola present just medial of center. The attached axillary tail measures 10 x 4 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is inked as follows: Blue -- Superior,. Orange - Inferior,. Black - Deep. The specimen is sliced from medial to lateral in nine slices with slice 1 most medial, slice nine most  Iateral (including axillary tail). The nipple is in slice #4. There is a dominant mass in the 3-4:00 aspect of the specimen, approximately 5 cm from the nipple, measuring 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm. This mass is 2 cm from the closest inferior margin, 1 cm from the deep margin,. and is al least 4 cm from all other margins. A nodule is appreciated superior-posterior to lesion #1, 1.2 x. 0.8 cm, within slabs 4-5. There is a second ill-defined nodule iocated approximately 3 cm superior to the largest mass, located in. the upper outer quadrant, approximately 2 cm in diameter. A third ill-defined area of nodularity is identified in the upper inner quadrant measuring up to 2.5 cm in diameter, located in slabs 3-4, from Case #: Printed: Page 4 This report continues...

Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT medial. In the lower inner quadrant, there is a 0.5 cm nodule, at ieast 1 cm from the nearest margin.. There is ill-defined nodularity in the lower outer quadrant region, apart from the main turnor, and areas of central fibrocystic changes. The axillary tail contains prominent Iymph nodes, the largest of which is 2.5 cm in diameter.
