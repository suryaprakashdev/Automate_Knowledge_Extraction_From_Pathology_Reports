Entry Date Result Narrative FINAL DIAGNOSIS A) Tongue, glossotonsillar mass, biopsy: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated (see comments) B) Lymph nodes, right neck, selective neck dissection:. - Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (3.5 cm in greatest dimension), see comments.  Thirty one lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/31). C) Tongue mass, right base, excision:. Salivary gland parenchyma admixed with skeletal muscle, negative for malignancy. COMMENT The frozen section slides from specimen A were reviewed and the carcinoma is not well represented on those slides The large tumor mass in the right neck does not contain any lymphoid tissue within it, and may represent either a soft tissue tumor deposit or (more likely) a lymph node which has been completely replaced by tumor.  If this is a replaced lymph node, there is extranodal extension of tumor into the surrounding soft tissue.. Immunohistochemical preparations, with appropriately staining controls were performed on a representative section of. tumor from specimen B and show the following results: Tumor cells are strongly and diffusely positive for pl6 and show no circumferential membranous staining for Egrr. Hpv studies have been ordered and the results will be issued in a separate report.
