Gross Description. Specimen A is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "right radical tonsillectomy." The specimen consists of a radical tonsillectomy specimen measuring 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. Upon receipt in Pathology, the specimen is fragmented into two distinct fragments. The specimen is oriented by the surgeon,. He specifies each mucosal margin, which are submitted for frozen section consultation. Arising within the palatine tonsil there is a large polypoid mass measuring 3.5 x 1.9 in surface  dimension by a depth of 1.4 cm. The mass is the following distance from each respective mucosal margin: superior 0.4 mm, medial 0.5 cm, inferior 1.0 cm and lateral 2.3 cm. The mass comes within 0.5 cm of the deep resection margin. The mucosal margins are inked as follows: superior, blue; medial, black; lateral, yellow, inferior, orange. The deep margin is inked green. A portion of the tumor is submitted for research purposes. Representative sections are submitted as described in the cassette summary. (Dictated by. Specimen B is received fresh and labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "final inferior margin; ink true margin". Received is a small piece of mucosal lined fibrous tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm with ink on one side. No discrete lesions are identified. The marked surface is re-ink blue and the specimen is serially. sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette "B1." (Dictated by. CASSETTE SUMMARY: A1FS: Lateral mucosal margin, shave A2FS:  Inferior mucosal margin, shave A3FS: Superior mucosal margin, shave A4FS:  Medial mucosal margin, shave A5: Tumor with respect to medial resection edge and deep margin A6:  Tumor with respect to medial resection edge and deep margin A7: Tumor with respect to superior resection edge and deep margin A8: Additional representative mass with respect to deep margin A9: Lateral resection edge (yellow) with respect to deep margin. A10,11:  Inferior resection edge (orange) with respect to deep margin Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis A1fS: LATERAL MARGIN (FROZEN SECTION): NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA. A2FS:  INFERIOR MARGIN (FROZEN SECTION): RARE DETACHED FOCUS OF CARCINOMA A3FS:  SUPERIOR MARGIN (FROZEN SECTION): NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA. A4FS:  MEDIAL MARGIN (FROZEN SECTION): NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
