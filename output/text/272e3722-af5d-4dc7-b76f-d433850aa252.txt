C1: 1 lymph node C2: 1 lymph node D. LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Received fresh labeled with matching patient identifiers and designated "wide local excision ieft breast" is a portion of resected breast tissue weighing 290 g and measuring 11 x 9 x 6 cm. The specimen is accompanied by a mammogram and needle localization wire. The specimen is received with orientation, the single short suture designates superior, long suture designates the lateral. The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-blue, posterior-black, superior-red orange, medial-green,. Iateral-yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 10 sections. Cut section. shows a firm beige ill-defined mass located 0.4-cm from the anterior/inferior margin. The mass measures 1.7 x 1.1 x 1 cm. the remainder of the specimen shows areas of white fibrous streaking septae adjacent to the lesion (medial aspect). The specimen was taken to mammography, sections were x-rayed. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1: Perpendicular sections lateral margin (section 1) D2: Anterior, demonstrates metaltic clip (section 4) D3-D4: Anterior, dense tissue (section 4) D5: Inferior, dense tissue (section 4) D6-D9: Mass, anterior/inferior margin (section 5) D10-D12: Anterior/inferior (section 6) D13-D15: Anterior/superior (section 7) D16-D17: Anterior/posterior (section 8) D18-D19: Anterior/inferior (section 9) D20-D21: Perpendicular sections medial margin (section 10) E. ADDITIONAL RETROAREOLAR TISSUE LEFT BREAST Blue-Anterior portion Received in formalin is an oriented tan pink fragment of fibrofatty tissue 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.5cm. The anterior. portion is inked Blue and the specimen is trisected. Toto E1. F. LEFT AXILLARY NON SENTINEL LYMPH NODES Received in formalin are multiple tan pink soft tissue fragments aggregating to 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.0cm. Dissection reveals 1 fatty lymph node 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.4cm. F1-F2: 1 lymph node F3: remainder of specimen

LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, LEFT AXiLLARY, BIOPSY: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1) - AE 1/3 NEGATIVE. C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3 AND #4, LEFT AXILLARY, BIOPSY: - TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/2) - AE 1/3 NEGATIVE - S100 MARKS CAPSULAR NEVUS. D. BREAST, LEFT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - INVASIVE, LOBULAR CARCINQMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 2.1-CM - INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN - PLEOMORPHIC LOBULAR CARCINOMA iN SITU - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE. E. BREAST, ADDITIONAL RETROAREOLAR TISSUE, BiOPSY: - INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA PRESENT AT INKED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN, SEE NOTE. F. LYMPH NODE, LEFT AXILLARY, BIOPSY: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (O/1). NOTE: The specimen was serially sectioned and x-rayed. The main mass was identified in slice #5. In slices #6 and 7, suspicious density is identified. This corresponds to the extending density seen on the mammogram. The main mass and the extending density microscopically are invasive iobular carcinoma. Also identified is metallic clip (area submitted in #D2). This are shows focus of LCIS. The largest invasive tumor measured on the slide (2.1-cm). The tumor is present at the anterior surgical resection margin (slide #D7) at a distance of 7-mm. The additional retroareolar tissue (part E.) also shows invasive tumor, presents at the anterior marked margin at a distance of 2-mm. Breast biomarkers pending and addendum report to follow.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: D7 ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 PR: Positive Allred Score:  5 = Proportion Score 2 + Intensity Score 3 COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by Dako (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by interna! review of staining performance.

Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (. sing rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides.  proviaea oy tne manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in- house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.. This assay has been validated according to the. ' joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force.
