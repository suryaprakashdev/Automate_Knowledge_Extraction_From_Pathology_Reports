Department of Patholoay SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT * Preliminary * Patient Name: Path No.: Med. Rec. #: Client: DOB/Gender: Collected: Location: Received: Soc. Sec. #: Reported: Hosp #: Physician(s): Pre-Operative/Clinical History Nonfunctioning left kidney. Specimen(s) Received A: TORSED APPENDAGE EPIPLOICA B: PERIHILAR RENAL LYMPH.NODE C: LEFT KIDNEY Gross Description Specimen A, received in formalin labeled torsed appendage epiploica, consists of a hemorrhagic firm portion of adipose tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The cut surface is tan-brown. Representative sections are submitted. Specimen B, received in formalin labeled perihilar renal lymph node, consists of a 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm portion of a lymph node. The cut surface is homogenous tan-pink. The node is sectioned and entirely submitted labeled Specimen C, received fresh from the OR labeled left kidney, consists of the following: Procedure/specimen type: Radical nephrectomy.. Specimen laterality:. Left. Description of specimen: The 726 gm kidney with associated perinephric fat measures overall 19.0 x 14.0 x 7.0 cm. Gerota's fascia is hemorrhagic with fibrous adhesions. Gerota's fascia is fibrotic and thickened measuring up to 0.5 cm. The perinephric fat is firm and lobulated measuring up to 2.0 cm in thickness. Blue ink is applied to Gerota's fascia and the mass grossly appears to abut the fascia. The attached segment of ureter measures 4.0 cm in length with an internal diameter of 0.3 cm and is grossly unremarkable and not involved by the tumor. The kidney measures 12.0 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm. The kidney is surrounded by a large cystic hemorrhagic mass containing.blood clot. The mass is attached to the kidney and grossly involves the renal parenchyma superiorly. Sections show a soft tan expansile solid area within the cystic mass abutting the surface of the kidney and slightly compressing the  renal parenchyma. The renal pelvis is slightly displaced. The corticomedullary junction within the superior pole of the kidney is pale white-pink and compressed. Within the superior pole of the. kidney is a portion of attached adrenal gland measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.3 cm. The adrenal  parenchyma shows thin brown medulla with focally thickened golden yellow cortex. The portion of adrenal gland is markedly adherent to the surface of the kidney and gross involvement by tumor cannot be definitively determined.. Page'1 of 4

HISTOLOGY REPORT Adrenal gland: Also received within the specimen container is a separate portion of adrena! gland measuring 5.0 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm and weighing 8 gm. The cut surface shows thin golden yellow cortices with brown medulla. The adrenal gland grossly does not appear to be involved by the tumor. Tumor site: Supracortical, with the solid component predominantly involving the superior pole of the kidney and the cystic component involving the remainder of the external kidney. Tumor size: The cystic component measures 19 cm in greatest dimension and the solid component. measures 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. Tumor description: The cystic mass involves the renal capsule with possible focal extension into the renal parenchyma. Within the cystic mass is a moderate amount of blood clot. The luminal surface of the mass is focally nodular: The cystic mass wall ranges from 0.1 cm to 0.6 cm in thickness. A representative section is submitted for frozen section Focality: Unifocal. Extent of invasion:. The tumor involves the renal capsule with foci suspicious for infiltration into renal parenchyma. Renal vessel involvement: Absent. Renal hilum: Uninvolved by tumor. Perinephric Iymph nodes: A single perinephric lymph node measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm which grossly is uninvolved by the tumor is present. Rena! parenchymal lesions:.  None identified. Gross photos are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows: (C1FS) Remainder of the frozen tissue. (C2) Ureteral margin, en face (C3) Renal artery and vein margin, en face (C4, 5) Gerota's fascia, perpendicular sections showing proximity of tumor (C6, 7) Adrenal gland and underlying tumor (C8) Separate portion of adrenal gland (C9) Renal hilum (C10) Renal lymph node, sectioned (C11-18) Kidney with adjacent tumor with guestionable areas of renal parenchymal involvement in (C11-13) (C19-25) Cystic mass wall (C26) Renal pelvic mucosa (C27) Superior calyceal mucosa (C28) Inferior calyceal mucosa (C29) Superior renal parenchyma (C30)  Inferior renal parenchyma. Intraoperative Consultation Specimen C, frozen section diagnosis of "carcinoma' is rendered by Page 2 of 4

HISTOLOGY REPORT Microscopic Description Summary of Pathologic Findings Renal Carcinoma Operative procedure: Radical nephrectomy. Tumor size: The cystic component of the tumor is 19.0 cm in greatest dimension with. a solid component of 5.0 cm in greatest dimension.. Laterality and focality: Left and unifocal. Histologic type: Papillary renal cell carcinoma Sarcomatoid features: Absent.  Histologic grade: Fuhrman 3/4. Extent of invasion: Extracapsular invasion into the perinephric tissue, not beyond Gerota's fascia. Lymph/vascular invasion: Absent. Margins: Radical nephrectomy margins: Renal vein margin: Negative. Gerota's fascial margin:. Negative. Ureteral margin: Negative. Adrenal gland: Not involved. Regional lymph nodes: Number of nodes examined:. 2. (includes specimen A) Number of nodes positive for tumor: 0.. Special studies: A panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed to delineate the immunophenotype of this. tumor. The following staining patter is observed:. CD10 Negative P504S Positive Vimentin Positive CK7 Negative Low molecular weight keratin Positive Mart-1  Negative HMB-45  Negative CD117  Negative N-cadherin Positive TFE3 pTNM stage: pT2b, pN0. The submitted epiploica (B) demonstrates infarction consistent with the clinical impression of torsion. There is no evidence of tumor. Page 3 of 4
