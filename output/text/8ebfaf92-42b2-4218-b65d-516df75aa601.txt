Effective is Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging system for prostatectomy of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC). Comment The bladder tumor has a very unusual morphology in that it shows dense solid growth of predominantly epithelioid cells with focal spindling and few loose myxoid areas. The epithelioid tumor cells are high grade, have modest amphophilic cytoplasm and with brisk mitotic activity. In addition, numerous osteoclast-like giant cells are distributed all throughout the tumor. Foci of tumor necrosis are also present. Immunohistochemical stains performed show that the tumor cells are nuclear positive for GATA3 and with rare nuclear positivity for p63. Keratin Cam5.2, CK7 and CK20 are negative. The positivity for GATA3 and p63 are supportive for urothelial carcinoma. Controls appropriate. Rare occurrence of osteoclast-like giant cells rich carcinoma, similar to the current case, has been reported in the urinary tract. The few cases previously reported showed an aggressive biologic behavior, see reference. On part C, the right lymphadenectomy specimen shows large soft tissue deposits

of carcinoma, which may represent overgrowths from a lymph nodal tumor metastasis. No normal lymph node tissue however is identified. Of note, right pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed previously (together with ureterectomy,. which was negative for tumor. Nodal status for the current bladder tumor. is most consistent with N1.

Resident/Fellow, [] MD Electronically Signed Out by [] MD Clinical History: Patient is an  year-old male with high-grade urothelial carcinoma undergoing radical cystectomy, prostatectomy, and lymph node dissection. Specimens Received:. A: Left pelvic lymph node B: Bladder, prostate, left and right vas differens. C: Right pelvic lymph node Gross Description: The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "Left pelvic lymph node". Received in formalin is an aggregate of yellow-tan, soft, and lobulated tissue fragments ranging in size from 1.1-1.4 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is. dissected to reveal 10 lymph node candidates ranging in size from 0.3-1.3 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted as follows:. A1: 3 lymph node candidates A2: 2 lymph node candidates A3: 2 lymph node candidates A4: 2 lymph node candidates A5: 1 lymph node candidate A6: 1 lymph node candidate B. The second container is additionally identified as, "bladder, prostate, left and right vas deferens". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 250 g, 12.5 x 7 x 6 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 8.5 x 6.5 x 3 cm bladder with attached mesenteric fat and a detached 3.2 x 2 x 1.7 cm probable tumor (or

prostate). The right seminal vesicles and right vas deferens are not clearly identified and a structure resembling the right seminal vesicles measure 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and there is no identifiable right vas deferens structure. The left vas deferens is not clearly identified and the left seminal vesicles measures 2.5x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and a structure resembling the left vas deferens measures 3 x 0.4 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 0.6 x 0.4 cm end. demonstrates an intact, patent lumen. The left ureteral stump is absent and the 1eft ureteral resection margin is taken where the ureter enters the bladder and is submitted as B3. The right half of prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra. The fragments of the outer surface of the tumor fragment are white-brown and shaggy. Sectioning demonstrates a diffuse, homogenous, ill-defined, firm, white-tan. The opened bladder reveals a 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm raised, soft, red-pink lesion on the anterior wall designated as lesion #1, a 4 x 1.8 x 0.3 cm raised, soft, red-pink lesion on the inferior posterior wall and right inferior lateral wall designated as lesion #2, a 2.5 x 2.5 cm left posterior wall hemorrhage, and a 1.4 x 1 x 0.2 cm raised, soft, red-pink lesion on the mid left lateral wall designated as lesion #3. There is also an aggregate of firm, white-tan tumor fragments, free floating within the bladder lumen and measuring 11 x 5 x 3 cm. On cut section, lesion #1 extends into the muscularis propria and grossly into the perivesical tissue and is close to the deep margin. On cut section, lesion. #2 does not extend beyond the mucosa, and lesion #3 does not extend beyond the  mucosa and is 1.0 cm from the deep margin. There is a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm rubbery, white-tan, mass which is in the muscle layer of the left lateral anterior wall and extending into the perivesicular adipose tissue. The surrounding bladder mucosa is edematous, wrinkled, congested, pink-tan with a uniform 0.1-0.2 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe patent. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1: Right ureter resection margin B2: Distal prostatic urethral margin B3: Left ureter resection margin (insertion into the bladder B4-B10: Representative right and left of probable tumor (rule out prostate) B11-B13 Lesion #1 (closest to deep margin B13) B14-B16 Lesion #3 (closest to deep margin B16) B17-B19: Lesion #2 B20: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome B21: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall B22: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall

The third container is additionally identified as, "Right pelvic lymph node". Received in formalin is an aggregate of yellow-tan, soft, and lobulated. fiber adipose tissue fragments ranging in size from 1-1.5 cm. The specimen is. dissected to reveal for lymph node candidates ranging from 0.5-1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:.
