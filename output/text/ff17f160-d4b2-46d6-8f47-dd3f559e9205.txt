Page 4 of 7 3 x 2 x 0.5 cm thick frozen section tissue remnant. Entirely submitted in C1. D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "left pelvic lymph node" are four nodules of tan adipose tissue consistent with lymphoid tissue ranging in size from 2 cm down to 1.5 cm. The excess fat is trimmed. All four nodes are submitted entirely as follows: D1- one lymph node bisected; D2= one lymph node bisected; D3-D4- one lymph node bisected; D5-D6= one lymph node bisected.. E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "right pelvic lymph node" are four nodules of tan fatty tissue. All four nodules are submitted as follows: E1-E2- one lymph node. bisected; E3- one single lymph node; E4= one single lymph node; E5-E6= one lymph node bisected.. F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "bladder, prostate gland and seminal vesicles" is a radical cystectomy specimen with attached fat measuring 16 x 11 x 7 cm. The attached prostate measures 4.5 x 4 x 4 cm. A 3 cm defect is. identified on the prostatic urethral margin. This is grossly consistent with tissue taken for frozen section evaluation. The specimen is inked black on the left and blue on the right. The right seminal vesicle measures 5 x 1 x 1 cm. The right vas deferens measures 7 cm in length. The left seminal vesicle measures 5 x 1 x 1 cm. The left vas deferens measures 11 cm in length. The left and right ureters are embedded in the fat and have been previously taken for frozen section evaluation. The bladder is opened anteriorly and in the dome of the bladder a circumscribed tan, friable mass is identified measuring 2.4 x 2 x 1 cm. The remainder of the bladder mucosa has a retracted cobble-stoned appearance. No additional gross tumor is identified. The cut surface of the mass has a very friable tan. glistening appearance and grossly appears to have invaded into the muscularis. The posterior bladder all on cut surface is grossly unremarkable. The left and right lateral bladder walls are serially sectioned and are grossly unremarkable. The right side of the prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a focally nodular tan-pink grossly unremarkable parenchyma. The left prostate is serially sectioned and in the lower one third the parenchyma reveals a 1 cm cyst that is lined with a smooth tissue.  The lumen contains a clear fluid. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: F1-F3= mass at dome on right side; F4-F6- mass at dome on left side; F7-F8- right posterior wall; F9-Flo- left posterior wall; Fll-F13= right lateral wall; Fl4-F16= left lateral wall; F17- right trigone; F18= left trigone; F19-F2l= representative sections of upper, mid and lower one third of prostate, right side; F22-F24=. representative sections of upper, mid and lower one third of prostate, left side. Also, F24 demonstrates cystic structure on. Additional sections Prepared t
