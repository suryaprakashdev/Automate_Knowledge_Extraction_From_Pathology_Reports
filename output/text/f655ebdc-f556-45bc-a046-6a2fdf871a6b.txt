LEFT BREAST, ADDITIONAL ANTERIOR MARGIN, AND LEFT AXILLARy SENTINEl LYMPH NODE SIMPLE MASTECTOMY (INCLUDING RE-EXCISION OF ANTERIOR MARGIN) AND SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY: - Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3. UUID:302E69E0-39F0-4CDB-97F9-A6CDDB3D7233 TCGA-AC-A6IW-01A-PR Redacted - Size: 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. - Location: 11:00. - No in situ component identified. - Margins: - Invasive carcinoma is widely free of all margins (at least 1 cm away). - Additional anterior margin consists of benign skin and subcutaneous tissue. - No Iymphovascular invasion identified.. - Two sentinel lymph nodes, negative for carcinoma (0/2). - Uninvolved breast parenchyma with focal fibroadenomatoid changes. - Benign skin and nipple with small intraductal papilloma. COMMENT: Breast carcinoma biomarker studies will be repeated on a representative section of tumor (block A7) due to the focal weak to strong reactivity for ER and PR in <1% tumor cells seen previously on core biopsy. The results will follow in an addendum. PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3. Type and grade (in situ): N/A. Primary tumor: pT2.

Patlent: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Signed by Source of Specimen: A. Breast;left B. Sentinel lymph node;left axillary C. Breast;left additional anterior margin Clinical History/Operative Dx: Malignant neoplasm of breast (female, left) Intraoperative Diagnosis: B. Left axillary sentinel lymph node : No tumor cells identifies Gross Descriptlon: A. Part A Is designated as left breast - stitch = lateral. Initially received in the fresh state for possible is an 862 gram left simple mastectomy, 26.8 cm mediallateral, 20.8 cm inferior-superior, and 4.0 cm posterior-anterior. The overlying ellipse of wrinkled, tan-brown skin is 26.3 x 13.0 cm with a medial-inferior orientated, darkened brown, wrinkled areola, 4.8 cm in diameter with a prominent 1.3 cm nipple. A double suture marks the lateral apex of the skin. A palpable mass is appreciated in the upper inner quadrant (approximating 11:00). The surgical margins are now differentially inked as follows: Superior superficial: Blue, Inferior superficial: Orange, Posterior: Black. Included within the container are two unoriented strips of wrinkled, tan-brown skin measuring 11.7 x 2.7 x 0.7 cm and 10.3 x 2.4 x 1.3 cm each. Case #: Page 4 Printed: This report continues...

Patient: Case FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT The breast is serially sectioned perpendicularly through the media-lateral long axis to reveal a well-demarcated, soft to rubbery, light gray, lobulated tumor mass measuring upwards of 2.6 x 2.5 x 2.3 cm (siabs 6-7, from medial). This tumor is placed grossly 1.0 cm from the superior superficial, 2.4 cm from the deep and greater than 5.0 cm from the inferior superficial, most medial and most lateral surgical margins. Along the medial periphery of the lesion is an embedded twisted radiologic marker. The remaining cut sections of the breast demonstrates admixed yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue without additional discrete nodularity. No lymph node tissue is appreciated along the lateral periphery. Sectioning through the remaining two strips of skin demonstrate unremarkable fibrofatty cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted. Cassette summary:. A1) nipple, A2) medial and lateral extension of skin, A3) upper inner quadrant, slab 3, A4) upper inner quadrant, slab 5, adjacent to tumor, A5) upper inner quadrant, tumor and superior superficial surgical margin, slab 6,. A6-A7) upper inner quadrant, tumor and superior superficial surgical margin, contiguous sections, slab 6, A8) upper inner quadrant, deep margin adjacent to tumor, slabs 6-7,.

A14-A15) upper outer quadrant, slabs 9 and 11, respectively. A16-A17) representation of separate strips of skin and subcutaneous fat, two pieces each B. Part B is left axillary sentinel lymph node (frozen section). Initially received in the fresh state for frozen section/touch prep analysis is a 6.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm pad of yellow-tan fatty soft tissue. Initial sectioning reveals a single fatty pink and tan lymph node candidate, 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. Two touch preparation slides are forwarded for microscopic evaluation. Further examination of the fat reveals possible additional lymph node tissue up to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is entirely submitted for routine histology with a sentinel node protocol performed in B1 and B2, and the  additional/residual lymph node tissue candidacy is submitted in B3 and B4 for routine histology. C. Part C is additional anterior margin - left. Initially received in the fresh state is a 15 gram elliptical excision of wrinkled , tan-brown skin and subcutaneous fat, 11.1 x 2.6 x 1.5 cm. The margins are submitted unoriented; the possible outer margin is now marked blue and the remaining surgical margins are marked black. Sectioning demonstrates glistening, admixed yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue without discrete nodularity or grossly unusual areas of change suggestive of residual or invasive tumor component. Representative section are submitted for microscopic evaluation in C1-C5 (six pieces Microscopic Description: A. - C.) Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis cytokeratin immunostain. rendered. The sentinel nodes (part B) were evaluated by H&E levels and. Controls are appropriate.
