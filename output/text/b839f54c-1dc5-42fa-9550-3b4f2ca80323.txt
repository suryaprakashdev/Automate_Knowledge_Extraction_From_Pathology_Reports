Gross Description: 1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon. The terminal ileum measures 15.2 cm in length and 4.1 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 41.6ir length with a circumference of 8.2 cm at the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measures 9 cm in length and averages 0.8 cm in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa are pink tan and smooth. The colonic serosa has a focus of retraction and is inked black.  Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 6 cm in thickness. There is also omentum (17.2 to 15 x 1 cm) specimen is opened to reveal a circumferential tan-pink mass measuring 3.5 cm in length and 8 cm in width. The mass is located in the transverse colon, immediately adjacent to a tattoo site, 32.2 cm from the proximal margin, 10.3 cm from the distal margin, and 16.5 cm from the ileocecal valve. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the muscularis. The depth of invasion is 0.3 cm grossly; the tumor has a thickness of 0.6 centimeters. There are two tan-pink polypoidal masses (1.1 cm and 0.4 cm in greatest dimension) located 3.0 cm and 4.5 cm from ileocecal valve, respectively. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for Summary of sections: P - proximal margin shave - distal margin shave T  tumor ** Continued on next page **
