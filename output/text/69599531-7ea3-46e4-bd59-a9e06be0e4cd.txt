 Page 2 of 3 I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. 1.) The apecimen is received freah and in labeled "gigmoid tolon*, It consiats of a segment of colon that measurea 13.8 cm in length by 6.8 cm in cizcumference at proximal resection margin (inked yellow) and 8.0 cn in Circumference at distal resection margin (inked blue). The serosal surface is smooth. The specimen is opened to reveal a pink fungating tumor that is located 4.0 cm from the distal margin and 4.2 cm from proximal margin. The turor measures 4.4 cm in length and 3.7 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 0.l cm, which is 0.5 cm Erom the gerosa. The remaining mucosa shows at least 16 polyps measuring ftom 0.2 to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension.. Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tiseue is. thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible noden are submitted. Representative sections are subnitted. The tunor is entirely submitted. tps submitted. Summary of sections: PM .- proximal margin. DM .-. distal margin T .. tumor  .. uninvolved mucosa polypa LN --" Iymph nodes. 2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal donut" and consisto of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2 x 2 x 1.5 cm. Multiple sutures and ataples are attached.. The mucogal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.. Summary of sectiong:. U--undesignated 3). The specimen is received in foxmalin, Iabeled "Distal donut" and consists of a xing of pink tan soft tisgue measuring 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.3 cm. the mucosa is removed and entirely aubmitted. Summary of sections: J-undeaignated +* Continued on next page **
