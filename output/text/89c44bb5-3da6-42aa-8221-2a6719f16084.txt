Accession Number: Report Status: Amend/Addenda Type: Surgical Pathology Specimen Type: Kidnev resection Procedure Date: Ordering Provide PATIENT: TCGA-CZ-5457 PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: A.RIGHT KIDNEY,NEPHRECTOMY: RENAL CELL CARCINOMA 13.5 cmclear cellFuhrman grade IV (of IVarising in the right lower pole. The tumor extends into the perirenal adipose tissue. Lymphovascular invasion is identified. Tumor invades the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis and renal sihus. Ureter, renal artery and vein margins are negative for cumor. Colloidal iron is negative in the tumor cells. www Immunohistochemistry performed at Bwh demonstrates the following staining profile in tumor cells: Positive-CDi0,RCC AJCC Classification (6th Edition): T3a Nx MX. The non-ncoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the findings wiil be reported in an addendum. B.REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: Fibroadipose tissue and blood clot. No Jymph nodes are present (the entire specimen was examined). CLINICAL DATA: History: with right kidney nase Operation: Nephrectomy. Operative Findings: None given. clinical Diagnosis: None given. ORGAN/TISSUE SUBMITTED: A/. Right kidney. B/2.Regiona1 lymph nodes. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in two parts eachlabeled with the patient's name and unit number. Part A,1.Right kidneyconsists of a 1369-g right nephrectomy specimen 27.0x14.0 x8.8 cm including right kidney 18.8x8.0 x 8.0 cm with a in dianeter)and ureter(4.8 x 0.4 cm in diameter. No adrenal gland is grossly identified. The specimen is inked black and bivalved to reveal a tan-to-red to tan-to-yellow focally encapsulated, and hemorrhagic lobulated mass (13.5 x 10.0 x 10.5 cm that is present in the lower pole of the kidney and directly abuts the capsule. The mash is less than 0.1 cn to the ink 4.5 cm to the yein,6.0 cm to the artery and 6.5 cm to the ureter. Upon sectioning, the remainder of the kidney, there are multiple (greater than five) areas of red/brown nodularity (0.3 to i.1 cm in greatest dimension) scattered throughout the renal parenchyma. There is also a large necrotic area (7.2x

Accession Number: Report Status: Final Type: Cytogenetics CASE PATIENT: Cytogenetc CGA-CZ-5457 KARYOTYPE: K370-80<4n>xxy-1-3-3-8-8de19p22x2-10-10-14-14add19 q13x2+20-21-21-22-22cp5 ANALYZED:5 SCORED:0 BANDING:GTG METAPHASES COUNTED:5 INTERPRETATION: Four different specimens were received from this tumor. All metaphases from the specimen labeled T3 contained clonal aberrations that included loss of chromosome 3,a characteristic finding in renal cell carcinomaclear cell type. No metaphases were available from the remaining 3 specimens. COMMENTS: Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a ievel of 400 bands or greater. INDICATION FOR TEST: Renal Cell Carcinoma

auorogyRepor The sample consistsof cortexand medulla. There are two hundred-two (202) glomeruli present, of which 15 (7.4 3) are globally aclerosed the sclerosed glomeruli tend to be grouped in small areas of parenchymal atrophy. remaining glomeruli show significant expansion of the mesangial areas with focal formation of early nodules.There are no discernible craters or double contours of the glomerular capillary wall in the Jones stain. Several distal tubules contain PAs-positive hyaline casts. The interstitium contains a mild Approximately 30 of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular at.rophy and interstitial fibrosis Arteries and arterioles exhibit a moderate degree of sclerosis with hyaline degeneration.
