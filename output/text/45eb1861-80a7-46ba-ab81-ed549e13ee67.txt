LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1 AND 2 INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: Gross Exam A Left breast, modified radical mastectomy: Tumor is grossly 0.1 cm for posterior margin and >0.5 cm from other margins. By Dr., called to Dr. at GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY Received fresh labeled with the patient name designated "ieft modified radical mastectomy", is a resected mastectomy specimen weighing 203 grams and measuring 19.6 x 7.5 x 5.8 cm. Specimen is received with orientation, a suture indicating the axiliary tail. The ellipse of beige-tan skin measures 15.8 x 7.2 cm. The light brown areola measures 2.5 cm in diameter. The everted nipple measures 1.3 cm in diameter. The surface of the skin shows two firm masses, the larger measuring 2.5 x 2, the smaller measuring 0.6 x 0.6 cm. A large mass is palpated beneath the two lesions. The deep posterior margin is inked black, the anterior is inked orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to mediai. Cut section shows a beige-tan firm, slightly necrotic mass which demonstrates a thick amber colored mucoid fluid. The mass lies just beneath the deep margin at a distance of 0.1 cm. The mass occupies the upper outer quadrant into the axillary tail. The mass measures 6.8 x 6.5 x 3.5 cm. The remainder of the specimen shows dark yellow lobulated adipose tissue with focal areas of white firm, fibrous parenchyma. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1-A2:  sections of lesion and closest margin, posterior, and skin. A3-A4:  one full thickness section from skin to deep margin with lesion A5-A11: sections of lesion from upper-outer quadrant through mid portion A12-A13: sections of lower-outer quadrant A14-A15: representative sections lower-inner quadrant A16-A17: representative sections upper-inner quadrant A18-A19: sections of nipple. A20-A24:  axillary lymph nodes, 2 sections from each B. LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1&2 Received fresh are multiple tan-pink fragments of fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 6.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. Dissection reveals 13 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. Section code: B1: Three possible lymph nodes B2: Four possible lymph nodes B3: Two possible lymph nodes UUID:6CC4E6EF-6664-448E-933E-FFA9117C7ABF TCGA-E2-A1LK-01A-PR Redacted B4: Two possible lymph nodes B5: One lymph node serially sectioned B6-B10: Largest lymph node serially sectioned.
