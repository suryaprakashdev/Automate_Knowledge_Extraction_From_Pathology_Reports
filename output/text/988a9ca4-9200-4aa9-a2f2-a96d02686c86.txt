This specimen is received for tumor banking and evaluation of the surgical margins and consist of an excision of breast tissue which measures 4 x 4 x 2.5 cm. Present on the. surface is an ellipse of light brown skin measuring 3 x 0.7 cm. The surgeon has tagged the surgical margins. With this as reference. I have inked the margins as follows: Blue is lateral Yellow is inferior Black is medial Red is superior Orange is deep Sectioning reveals a firm, stellate. tan tumor which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension. The tumor focally touches the lateral margin. The next nearest margin is medial at 2 mm. The remaining margins are greater than 1 cm from tumor. A representative section of the tumor is submitted for tumor banking. A recent biopsy site is present in the tumor. ** CONTINUED CN NEXT PAGE ** :

RUN DATE: RUN TIME: PAGE 3 Specimen Inquiry RUN USER SPEC #:  PATIENT: (Continued) GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued) Representative sections are submitted as blocks A1 through A5 B. This is an excision of breast tissue which measures 2 x 2 x 1 cm. The surgeon has tagged the now lateral margin. I have applied blue ink to this margin. No gross evidence of residual tumor is present in this spscimen. Representative sections are submitted as blocks B1 and B2. C. This is a soft. tan lymph node which measures 15 x 10 x 5 mm. sectioned and totally submitted as block c1 for sentinel node protocol. There is no gross evidence of metastatic 1 tumor. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION A (BREAST EXCISION) : FOCAL TUMOR PRESENT AT LATERAL MARGINS WITH REMAINING MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION B (RE-EXCISION LATERAL MARGIN) : NO GROSS EVIDENCE OF TUMOR IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION C (SENTINEL NODE) : NO GROSS EVIDENCE OF TUMOR !
