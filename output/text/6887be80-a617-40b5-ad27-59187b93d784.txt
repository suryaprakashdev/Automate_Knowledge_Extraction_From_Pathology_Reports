SPECIMEN TYPE: The HER2 is performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slide from block C3. DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: The HER2 assay enables the HER2 gene and Chr17 centromere to be co-hybridized and visualized via light microscopy on the same slide. Specifically for this assay,. HER2 is detected by a dinitrophenyl (DNP) labeled probe visualized utilizing  SISH DNP (silver in situ hybridization) detection kit. The Chr17 centromere is targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe and detected using. ISH DIG detection kit. Dual ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HER2 appears as discrete black signals (SISH) and Chr17 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells serving as internal positive control for staining) as well as in carcinoma cells. SLIDE SCORING: Once an adequate target area is identified the reader records the scores for HER2 and Chr17 copy numbers that are present in 20 representative nuclei. If the resulting HER2 / Chr17 ratio falls within 1.8-2.2 (EQUrvOCAL) the reader is recommended to score an additional 20 nuclei and theresulting ratio is calculated from the total 40 nuclei. HER2 gene status is reported as non-amplified (HER2/ Chr17 < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17  2.0) Printed by: Page 1 of 7 Print Date/Time: Copied to: Distribute to: Patient Locations:

ESTROGEN RECEPTORS: 99 %, positive. PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: 40 %, positive. STAINING INTENSITY:moderate HER-2NEU: SCORE 2+, EQUIVOCAL. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block C3) using the following monoclonal antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1), Progesterone receptor (Clone 1E2) and Her-2neu. Clone 4B5); control sections for HER-2Neu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF-7, score 1+ T-47D, score 2+ MDA-MB-453, score 3+ BT-474). Detection system used: polymer. Primary antibodies. reagents and control sections for HER-2neu are all provided by* All controls show appropriate reactivity.. Reactivity of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors is determined based on the percentage of positively stained nuclei of tumor. cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells. Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong.. HER-2neu reactivity is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Score 0 = Negative: No immunoreactivity, or faint weak immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the. membrane is positive. Score 1 = Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive.. Score 2+ = Equivocal: Weak to moderate complete membrane immunoreactivity in >10% of tumor cells or. Page 2 of 7 Print Date/Time
