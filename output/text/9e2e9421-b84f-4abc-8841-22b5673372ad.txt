AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Electronically Signed Out *** Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled. "Right Distal Ureter". It consists of a 0.3 x 0.2 cm tubular piece of tan-pink soft tissue. The specimen is entirely frozen and subseguently submitted for permanent sections. Summary of Sections: FSc - frozen section control 2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled. "Left Distal Ureter". It consists of a 0.3 x 0.2 cm tubular piece of tan-pink soft tissue. The specimen is entirely frozen. and subsequently submitted for permanent sections. Summary of Sections: FSc - frozen section control 3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Bladder and Prostate". It consists of a 24 x 14 x 5.8 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached overlying adipose tissue. The left half of the prostate is inked blue and the right half is inked green. In the left half of the bladder there is a palpable tumor mass which appears to occupy the left lateral and anterior wall. The. overlying adipose in this area is inked black. There is approximately 3 cm in length of ureter on the left and 4.5 cm of ureter on the right. Both ureters are probe patent. The specimen is opened along the anterior wall to reveal a 7.5 x 6.8 x 3.3 cm, fungating, ulcerated tumor mass occupying the central. and lateral left posterior bladder wall as well as the anterior bladder wall. The tumor is left lateral and anterior and is adjacent to, but not occluding, the left ureteral orifice within. the bladder. The uninvolved bladder mucosa is hemorrhagic and rugose. The trigone is not grossly involved by tumor. Serial sectioning of the tumor reveals the cut surfaces are yellow-white. and necrotic. The tumor invades the muscularis mucosa, however,. Page 2 of 5
