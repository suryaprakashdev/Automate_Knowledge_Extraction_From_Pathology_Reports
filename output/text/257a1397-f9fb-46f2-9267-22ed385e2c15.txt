TERMINAL ILEUM AND RIGHT COLON CLINICAL HISTORY: Not given GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. TERMINAL ILEUM AND RIGHT COLON Received fresh and labeled as "terminal ileum and right colon". Received is a closed segment of colon and terminal ileum measuring 26.4 cm in length. There is a constricted portion of the right colon located at the mid segment. This entire segment is inked blue. The terminal ileum measures approximately 4.6. x 4.1 cm and the right colon measures 22.0 cm in length and 6.0 cm in diameter. There is an ulcerated tumor mass measuring 2.2 x 2.2 x 0.6 cm which extends through the muscularis propria. The tumor is situated in the colon and is located 11.0 cm from the proximal margin and 13.0 cm from the distal. colonic margin. There are several polyps present throughout the right colon ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.7 cm. Sections are taken for tissue procurement and gross photograph was also taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1: shaved sections of proximal margin A2: shaved sections of distal margin A3-A11: mass, including deep margin A12: polyps A13: normal-appearing colonic mucosa. A14-A17: possible lymph nodes A18: normal-appearing tissue from ileum
