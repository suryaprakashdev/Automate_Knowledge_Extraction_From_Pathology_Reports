PROCEDURAL DEMOGRAPHICS: Date of Procedure: Accession Date/Time: GROSS DESCRIPTION: The snecimen is received in two containers labeled - A. Auumonally labeled right sentinel node and contains a 1.7 cm yellow tan fibrofatty soft tissue. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section with the. residual entirely resubmitted fnr nermanent section in cassette A labeled B. Additionally labeled left breast and contains a 641 gram, 20.0 x 13.5 x 7.0 cm simple mastectomy specimen partially surfaced by a 17.5 x 9.3 cm ellipse: of pink tan wrinkled skin bearing a central 1.4 x 1.2 x.0.5 cm everted nipple. No orientation is offered or possible. The deep margin is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm ill defined gray white gritty mass that resides 3.5 cm from the skin surface and approaches to within 3.5 cm of the inked deep margin. Located immediately adjacent to this mass is a 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.3 cm shaggy, necrotic cavity consistent with previous biopsy site. This cavity resides 1.5 cm below the skin surface and approaches to within 3.5 cm of the inked deep margin. The remainder of the cut surface is comprised of predominantly yellow tan adipose tissue admixed with moderate amounts of interspersed gray white fibrous tissue. No additional masses are identified. Also received in the same container is an 11.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm strip of pink tan wrinkled skin with adherent yeilow tan fibrofatty soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a yellow tan fibrofatty cut surface with no discrete lesions. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes B1-B13 :  designated as follows: B1-- nipple; labeled B2-- inked deep margin, perpendicular; B3-B5-- mass; B6-B9-- previous biopsy cavity; B10-B12-- representative sections from the three uninvolved quadrants; B13-- sections from separately submitted skin and fibroadipose tissue. Additionally, a yellow and green cassette are submitted for genomic research each labeled INTRA-PROCEDURE CONSULTATION: A.

margin. The specimen is inkl. .s follows: Superficial-. blue, deep - black, superior - green, and inferior - orange. The specimen is serially sectioned in a medial to lateral fashion to reveal a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm white-tan, firm. well-defined mass/possible lymph node which extends to the medial, superior, inferior, superficial margins, is within 0.7 cm of the deep margin and greater then 1 cm from the lateral margin. The mass is covered in a moderate amount of overiying blue surgical dye. Remaining breast parenchyma is approximately 10% tan, somewhat dense fibrous tissue. Cut surfaces are also remarkable for a few foci of hemorrhage up submitted in cassettes labeled as folfows: A1-A7 are in a medial to lateral fashion. A1 is a full cross section of the mass to show the nearest superficial, deep, superior, inferior margins; A2. Additional section of the mass; A3-A7. Remaining full cross sections of the specimen; A8. Medial margin and transverse sections; A9. Lateral margin and transverse sections. B. Additionally labeled "2 - Left medial margin, old margin up, new margin down" and consists of a 1.9 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm portion of yellow-tan, lobulated, fibrofatty breast tissue, stitched to a Telfa pad to indicate that the new margin is face down; new margin is inked blue. Sectioning reveals tan-yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty and friable cut surfaces. No significant fibrous tissue or distinct nodular lesions are identified. The entire specimen is submitted  seauentially in cassettes B1 and B2 labeled. INTRA-PROCEDURE CONSULTATION: MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: THERAPEUTIC MARKERS Test Description Breast Cancer Analvsis using Immuno-histochemistry, I. and Pathologist review. . is a FDA approved adjunctive, cornputer-assisted and interactive microscopy system which aids the pathotogist in the detection, classification, and counting of cells of interest thereby standardizing slide scoring through quantitative assessment of marker intensity, size and shape. Estrogen / Progesterone Receptors ER/PR ER = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (clone SP1) PR = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1E2) Anti-Estrogen receptor (ER) primary antibody is a rabbit monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the qualitative detection of estrogen receptor antigens in sections of formalin-lixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system.

Iocated in the nucleus of norr  ind neoplastic cells. This test is indicated as and aid in tne managernent, prognosis,. and prediction of therapy outcome of hreast cancer. Anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) primary antibody is a rabbit monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the quantitative detection of the A, B and C isoforms of human progesterone receptor antigens in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated stide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system. This test is indicated as and aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. The significance of PR is  its role in determining the functionality of estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells. The presence of estrogen does not guarantee a response to endocrine therapy. One way to evaluate the functionality of the ER present in breast carcinoma is to determine if the proteins regulated by ER are expressed. PR receptor is such a protein, and has historically been-used to monitor the functionality of ER. The measures the percentage of positively stained nuclei of the tumor cells. Note: False negatives are possible. Positive staining for receptor in the norma! glands if present is a good internal control, and increases the likelihood that a negative result is a true negative. Ki-67 = Rabbit Monoclonal (clone 30-9) Anti-Ki-67 primary antibody is directed against the C-terminal portion of the Ki-67 antigen, which is expressed in the nuclei of proliferating cells (normal and neoplastic). The antibody identifies proliferating activity in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system.. Assessment of tumor proliferative activity, IHC staining of tumor cell nuclei, can be used for prognosis and therapy planning. Ideal for use with small breast cancer specimens. The percentage of positively stained tumor nuclei is renorted The . is an indirect biotin method. Interpretation utilizes the instrument. The. is a Tissue Fixation. ER/PR testing guidelines were released which include fixation recommendations. All tissue should be fixed in neutral buffered formalin as soon as possible. Excisional and mastectomy specimen tissue should be fixed for a minimum of 6 and maximum of 72 hours. For tissue not fixed within the optimal time period or if fixation time is unknown it should be noted on report. Any negative Her2 IHC result without optima! fixation time should have Her2 FiSH testing performed. p4

EXAMINATION: MRI BRFASTE .ATERAL 1 Completed: FULL RESULT: Indication: Newiy dlagnosed left breast cancer.. Comparison: Multiple mammograms dating back to. FINDINGS: Bilateral breast MRI was performed with and without contrast. CAD-stream. computer-aided detection system was utilized to obtain multiplanar and 3-D reconstruction images. Subtraction images were created from dynamic contrast data. All Images were evaluated at a work station.: The right breast'demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement or adenopathy. On the left, axillary lymph nodes are more hypervascular than on the right but morphologically they are similar and symmetric. In the anterior upper-outer quadrant of the left breast, there Is a. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm irregular enhancing mass consistent with the patient's known malignancy. Muitiple scattered nodules are identified throughout the left breast.  #1--3 cm superior, posterior and medial to the known malignancy is a 6 x 5 x 7 mm enhancing nodule. Review of the. prior mammograms demonstrates that this was not present prior to this year's mammogram and therefore is highly suspicious for a satellite lesion. #2--Approximately 1 cm posterior to the known malignancy'is a 3 mm nodular area ol enhancement.. #3--2.3 cm inferior and laterai to the known malignancy is a 5 mm nodule . These are all suspicious for satellite lesions. #4--In the far lateral aspect of the breast, there is a 1-2 mm enhancing nodule.. #5--Even more laterally, is a 3-4 mm enhancing nodule. This contains a fatty hilum and these latter two nodules are likely lymph nodes given their far lateral location and appearance. #6--In the posterior medial left breast a 3 mm enhancing nodule is seen.. #7-- in the far medial skin of the left breast there is a 4 x 2 x 4 mm enhancing nodule. This could represent either a benign or malignant skin tesion and therefore clinical correlation is recommended.  Interspersed between the known malignancy and the suspected satellite lesions, are vague areas of subthreshold nodular enhancement. A 1.6 and 1.4 cm area of this type of enhancement is seen in the.medial.breast..Comparison of the.MIP.

projections show that these ol dI areas of scattered enhancement and nodutarity are very asymmetric to the right and therefore may relate to additionai disease . Inclusion of all of the areas of enhancement shows that a large percentage of the breasts may be involved with disease measuring up to 8.0 x 6.8 cm.. Muiticentric disease should be excluded. If breast conservation therapy. is considered, then biopsy of one or more of the  nodules will be needed. The 7 mm lesion, 3 cm from the known malignancies. (#1) would likely be visible by ultrasound and amenable to biopsy. Some of the smaller more posterior nodules in the. medial breast may not be visible by ultrasound. IMPRESSION: 1. The patlent's known malignancy is identified in the anteror upper-outer quadrant and measures 1.5 cm. There are  multiple scattered 'enhancing nodules seen within the breast that are.  suspicious for satellite lesions. Biopsies as clinically indicated should be performed.
