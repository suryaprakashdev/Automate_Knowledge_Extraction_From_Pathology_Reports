LCD6*2 teo 9680/3 jrjh MsQ,inginel C 77 4 LEFT INGUINAL LYMPH NODE: FO s33i/14 Multiples tissue fragments, which measure 3,4 x 2,8 x 0,6 cm. INGuINAL LEFt LympH NODE (EXCiSIOn): - DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA The sections correspond to a lymph node which shows a complete deletion of the architecture by a vaguely nodular proliferation with extensively diffuse areas. The tumor is composed of a monotonous proliferation of atypical large cells of centroblastic type with mitotic and apoptotic figures. The inmunohistochemistry study has shown positivity of atypical large cells for CD20, CD79a, CD10, bcl-6 and bcI-2, and negativity for MUM1. Stains for follicular dendritic cells (CD21, CD35) highlight the diffuse growth of the neoplasia. There is a moderate expansion of T cells positive for CD3 and CD5. The Ki67 proliferation index is higher than 80%. FISH: A rearrangement of the MYC gene has been found. END
