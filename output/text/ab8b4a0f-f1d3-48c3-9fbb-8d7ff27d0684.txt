Operative Procedure: DA Vinci right radical nephrectomy Specimen Received: A:  Interaortocaval Iymph nodes B:  Right paracaval lymph node C: Right kidney. Final Pathologic Diagnosis: A. "Interaortocaval lymph nodes," biopsy: Four lymph nodes negative for malignancy (0/4) B. "Right paracaval lymph nodes," excision: One of eleven lymph nodes positive for metastasis measuring 0.7 cm (1/11 slide B4) Positive for extranodal extension. C. Kidney, right, nephrectomy: Tumor histologic type: Poorly differentiated carcinoma, favor type Il papillary renal cell carcinoma (see NOTE) Tumor size: 6.5 cm Other dimensions: 6.2 x 5 cm Macroscopic extent of tumor: Macroscopic extension into perinephric fat, renal sinus fat, and a renal vein Focality: Unifocal Fuhrman grade: 3 of 4 Perinephric fat invasion: Yes Renal sinus invasion: Yes Renal vein involvement: Yes Adrenal gland present: No Cancer at resection margin: No Pathologic findings in nonneoplastic kidney: No Hilar lymph nodes present: No Pathologic stage pT3 pN1 pM(not applicable) The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were performed by the staff pathologist. Note: The tumor is composed of a variable morphology including areas of typical papillary renal cell carcinoma, and areas resembling collecting duct, carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, and sarcomatoid areas. However, TFE3 were negative. The  majority of the H/E slides demonstrate a papillary architecture but there are many areas that are difficult to classify. Numerous immunohistochemical stains

and additional sections help support the above diagnosis but the tumor may better be represented as unclassified type. The translocation carcinoma is virtually ruled out with the negative HMB45 and Melan-A. The tumor is variable. positive for cytokeratin 34betaE12 and CK7 in the more papillary areas with. diffuse positivity with cytokeratin AE1/AE3. There is also a nonspecific perinuclear dote like staining with the p63. There does not appear to be any mucin. The overall staining with positive CK7, PAX-2, AMACR, and focal CD10 support a papillary renal cell carcinoma but does not totally rule out a collecting duct carcinoma/medullary carcinoma. The patient does not have a history of sickle cell trait and the morphology is not convincing of medullary carcinoma. The possibility of an invasive urothelial carcinoma is unlikely because extensive sampling failed to demonstrate malignant TCC or CIS component. A TTF-1 immunostain was also negative. The above stains were performed with adequate controls. Gross Description: The specimen is received in formalin three parts labeled with the patient's name. Part A labeled"interaortocaval lymph nodes" and consists of a portion of irregular, ragged, gray-yellow, lobulated fat, which has dimensions of 3.0 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm. An exhaustive search of the fat to include the use of palpation and chemical clearing agent reveals four probable lymph nodes that range from 0.4 to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as labeled: A1 one bisected lymph node;. A2  three lymph nodes submitted in toto. Part B labeled "right paracaval lymph nodes" consists of a portion of irregular, ragged, gray-yellow lobulated fat, which has dimensions of 8.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm. An exhaustive search of the fat to include the use of palpation and a chemical. clearing agent reveals eleven probable lymph nodes that range from 0.4 to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as labeled: B1-2 ten lymph nodes submitted in toto; B3-4 one bisected lymph node.. Part C labeled "right kidney.". Specimen components and dimensions: The specimen consists of a right kidney received with a moderate amount of attached perinephric fat. The specimen has dimensions of 15.6 x 7.4 x 6.6 cm. The renal parenchyma has dimensions of 10.4 x 6.2 x 5.4 cm. An adrenal gland is not present. There is an attached segment of ureter, which has a length of 7.9 cm and a diameter of approximately 0.5 cm throughout. The vessels are identified and ligated close to the kidney. Some tissue has been submitted fresh to the. Size, appearance, and location of tumor: The central kidney is remarkable for a gray-white, indurated, fibrous mass with lobulated edges, which has dimensions

of 6.5 x 6.2 x 5.0 cm. Renal capsule/renal sinus: At the hilum, this mass extends to the capsule. It is possible there are some foci where the mass traverses the capsule and superficially invades the hilar fat. The renal sinus fat is grossly invaded. The. mass extends through the capsule. into the perinephric fat and to within 1 mm of the posterior inked soft tissue edge.. Renal vein: The renal vein is grossly invaded and extends to within 0.3 cm of the renal vein margin. Lymph nodes (size, number, & location): An exhaustive search of the hilar fat to include the use of palpation and a chemical clearing agent reveals no grossly identifiable lymph nodes. Other findings: The renal parenchyma is red-brown with a well defined corticomedullary border and a cortical thickness of approximately 0.6 cm throughout. The urothelium is gray-white, smooth and glistening with some of the pelvis and calyces markedly compressed by this mass. It is unclear as to whether the mass arises from the pelvic urothelium or the surrounding parenchyma. Blocks submitted:. C1  ureter margin en face; C2  vein and artery margin en face; C3 proximal ureter;. C4 mid ureter; C5 distal ureter; C6-8 mass to capsule and inked external surface at the hilum;. C9-10 mass to capsule and inked external surface at the posterior. aspect; C11 mass to intraparenchymal renal vein;. C12-13  mass to renal sinus fat; C14  normal most parenchyma; C15  mass to pelvis.. Additional representative sections are submitted in cassettes C16-25.. Also, gross images have been taken of the specimen. Due to the nature of the tissue procurement performed on the specimen, prosecting was extremely challenging. Microscopic Description: The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination findings. END OF REPORT Taken: Gender: F
