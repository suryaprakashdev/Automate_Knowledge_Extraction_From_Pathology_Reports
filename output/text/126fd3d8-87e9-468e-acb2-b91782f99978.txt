Therefore, the false- negativity is due to sampling error. The morphology of metastatic tumor is similar to the larger grade 3 tumor (see below). In the left mastectomy specimen, 2 nodules are grossly identified, larger nodule located in U0Q measuring 1.6 and is. of grade 3; and a smaller nodule, located in posterior UiQ, measuring 0.5-cm and is of grade 1. Breast biomarkers on both nodules are pending.. In the right mastectomy specimen, 4 nodules are grossly identified, one is fibroadenoma, one is sclerosing adenosis and the other two are separate foci of invasive ductal carcinoma. The largest invasive tumor measures 1.1-cm and it. is of grade 3. Breast biomarkers are as follows, ER negative, PR negative and HER-2/neu equivocai (2+, FISH pending). The smaller nodule measures 0.6-cm and it is of grade 2. The breast biomarkers are as follows ER  positive, PR positive and HER-2/neu equivocal (2+, FISH pending). Also, the morphology of grade 3 tumors (right and left) is different. It seems that there are 4 different primary tumors,. 2 in each breast. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST
