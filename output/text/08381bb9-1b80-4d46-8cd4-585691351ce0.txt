The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette labeled AFS Part B is received fresh from the operating room for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled with the patient's name and "Right axillary sentinel lymph node #1". It consists of one piece of fatty tissue measuring 3.2 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm. One lymph node is palpated measuring 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node is bisected. The specirnen is entirely submitted in four cassettes labeled BFs1-BFs2, B1 and B2. Please note: Three levels and cytokeratin stains are ordered for the lymph node only. Legend: BFS1-BFS2 = frozen section-lymph node, B1-B2 = remaining tissue. Part C is received fresh from the operating room for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled with the patient's name and "Right axillary sentinel lymph node #2". It consists of one piece of fatty tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.9 x 1.1 cm. One lymph node is palpated measuring 2.7 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node is quadrisected. The specimen is entirely submitted in five cassettes labeled CFS1-CFS4 and C1. Please note: Three levels and cytokeratin stains are ordered for the lymph node only.. Legend: CFS1-CFS4 = frozen section-lymph node, C1 = remaining tissue. Part D is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name and "Right breast mastectomy, stitch short anterior subnipple tissue, stitch long = lateral". It consists of a right total skin sparing mastectomy specirnen measuring 22.0 x 14.0 x 3.5 cm. A short suture is noted indicating the subareolar and a long suture is noted indicating the superior (as per Dr. , the long suture was mistakenly labeled "lateral"). An underlying mass is palpable located 1.0 cm. from the subareolar. The subareolar is inked blue, the superficial margin is inked yellow and the deep margin is inked black. The axillary tissue measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. No lymph nodes are palpable within it.. The specimen is serially sectioned at closely spaced intervals, revealing an area of white, cystic parenchyma measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm located in the center, 0.5 cm from the deep margin and 0.2 cm from the superficial margin. Within the cystic parenchyma is a firm, poorly circumscribed, white-tan mass measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm which comes to within 0.6 cm from the deep margin and 1.3 cm from the superficial margin. At least four scattered yellow-white nodules measuring from 0.5 cm to 0.8 cm in diameter are also seen within the cystic parenchyma located 0.3 cm from the deep margin and 1.5 cm from the superficial margin and at least 1.0 cm from the nass. The remainder of the specimen is composed of a moderate amount of breast tissue (60%) and a moderate amount of yellow fatty tissue (40%). Also received in the container is one irregular piece of soft, fibrofatty, yellow-red tissue measuring 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. On cut surface, no discrete lesions or lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted in 26 cassettes labeled D1-D26. Please note: The specimen was placed in formalin at LEgEND: D1-D2 = Submucosal area D3-D4 = Mass with adjacent deep margin. D5-D7 = Remaining portion of mass D8 = Superficial margin closest to mass. D9-D10 = Nodule closest to mass with adjacent surrounding tissue and deep margin D11 = Remaining portion of nodule with adjacent surrounding tissue D12-D15 = Surrounding nodules in cystic parenchyma D16-D17 = Cystic parenchyma D18-D19 = Upper inner quadrant D20-D21 = Lower inner quadrant D22-D23 = Lower outer quadrant D24-D25 = Upper outer quadrant D26 = Fibrofatty tissue also received in the container.. Part E Is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name and "Skin from mastectomy R breast". It consists of a strip of rubbery, tan-brown skin measuring 11.6 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm. Representative sections are submitted in one cassette labeled E1. Please note: The specimen was placed in formalin at. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: AFS: Benign breast tissue and large ducts. No carcinoma seen. Page 2 of 5
