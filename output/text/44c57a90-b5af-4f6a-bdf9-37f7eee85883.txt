DIAGNOSIS (A) PERINEPHRIC FAT, PERMANENT: Adipose tissue, no tumor present. (B) RIGHT RENAL MASS, UPPER POLE, INKED AT MARGIN: RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (5.5 CM). Parenchymal margin, free of tumor. (C) PERINEPHRIC FAT ADDITIONAL: Fibroadipose tissue, no tumor present.. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) PERINEPHRIC FAT, PERMANENT- Two portions of adipose tissue (11.5 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm and 9.0 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm) are homogenous without lesion. SECTION CODE: A1-A5, representative portion. (B) RIGHT RENAL MASS UPPER POLE, INK AT MARGIN - A partial nephrectomy specimen (8.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm). A solid well- circumscribed tumor (5.5 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm) is identified 2.0 mm from the purple inked parenchymal margin. It has a variegated appearance with yellow and red hemorrhagic areas. The remainder of the tumor is surrounded by adipose tissue. A photograph is obtained. Portions are submitted for electron. microscopy.e  INK CODE: The purple ink area is re-inked in black.. SECTION CODE: B1, mass with closest perpendicular renal parenchymal margin for frozen section; B2-B5, tumor with perpendicular renal parenchymal margin; B6-B9, tumor with adjacent adipose tissue. *FS/DX: MARGIN, FREE OF TUMOR. (C) PERINEPHRIC FAT ADDITIONAL - A single portion of adipose tissue (21.0 x 14.0 x 3.5 cm) has attached fascia without gross lesion. SECTION CODE: C1-C6, representative portions of adipose tissue and fascia CLINICAL HISTORY History of right renal mass. SNOMED CODES T-71000, M-82123
