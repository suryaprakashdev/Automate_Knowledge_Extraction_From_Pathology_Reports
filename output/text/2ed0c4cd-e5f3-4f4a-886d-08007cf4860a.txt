Suture marking margins: long-lateral, short-superior Lymph Node,~Sentinel left axiilary. Frozen Diagnosis : Report : GROSS EXAMINATION: A. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the Elotsg name of the patient and identified as breast, left simple mastectomy. The specimen consists of a mastectomy measuring en bloc 11.5 x 9.5~x 4 cm and weighing 158 grams. There is an anterior ellipse of skin measuring~6 x 3~cm with a central 3 cm areolar complex with retracted nipple. Sections of nipple/areola are sampled in block 1.. The skin is sampled in block 2.  The superficial superior margin is inked orange and the superficial inferior margin is inked blue. The deep margin is inked green and the~specimen sectioned, showing an oval grey-tan firm mass measuring 2.8 cm in the upper inner quadrant'of the breast. Grossly, this mass is 0.4 cm from the inked deep margin of resection, which is submitted in block 3. Sections of the mass are submitted in blocks 4-7.  The remaining breast is composed. SON of yellow lobulated adipose tissue admixed with islands of gray-white rubbery tissue.  The breast is divided into four. E-9-V0/ quadrants, upper inner, lower inner, upper outer and lower. outer and sampled in blocks 8-11 respectively. Minimal axillary tissue is present and no lymph nodes are. identified.  Formalin fixation time is 11 hours. B. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the name of the patient and identified as lymph axillary sentinel node. Specimen Size: 1.8 x 1.5 x 1 cm. No. of Nodes: 1 Size of Nodes: 1.8 cm The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted. THIS CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED DOCUMENT/INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAW.
