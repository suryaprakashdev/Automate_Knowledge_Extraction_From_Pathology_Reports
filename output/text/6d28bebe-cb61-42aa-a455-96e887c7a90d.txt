ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100)  provided by following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified.

METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved. using rabbit anti- human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation.  Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP  and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. CLINICAL HISTORY: None provided. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:E Right breast cancer. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: A: Right breast, lumpectomy: Mass is 0.6 cm from the closest inferior margin. By Dr., called to Dr. at. ADDENDUM: Results of the gross examination performed on specimen A were omitted from the original report and are as follows: HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FiSH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the  by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17 signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A4 Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No:NA Tissue source breast  Results interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 0.9 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of  HER-2/neu signals by the total number of CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count Limitations The  is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is  intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free.  and overall survival in stage il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding  adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu. gene amplification status alone.. Overview of this test FDA APPROVED REAGENT  HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of  patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the  under the direction of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the  clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
