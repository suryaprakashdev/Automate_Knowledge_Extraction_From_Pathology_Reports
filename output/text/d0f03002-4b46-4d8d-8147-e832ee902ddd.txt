Comment Part B: The metastatic carcinoma is represented by a single gland that is positive for Cam5.2. Immunohistochemical stain PSA is non-contributory due to. the absence of the malignant gland on a section submitted for. . immunohistochemistry. Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the.

Clinical History: The patient is a.  year-old male with bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy.. Specimens Received: A: Left pelvic lymph nodes B: Right pelvic lymph nodes C: Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, vas deferens D: Left distal ureter stitch Gross Description: The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph. nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of lobulated yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 7.2 x 5.4 x 1.3 cm. The specimen is dissected for lymph node candidates. 5 lymph node candidates are identified measuring 0.5-4.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are entirely submitted as follows: A1: 2 lymph node candidates A2: One lymph node candidate, bisected A3-A4: One lymph node candidate, sectioned. A5-A8: One lymph node candidate, sectioned. B. The second container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of lobulated yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 7.9 x 7.1 x 1.6 cm. The specimen is dissected for lymph node candidates. 10 lymph node candidates are identified. measuring 0.4-7.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are. entirely submitted as follows: B1: 4 lymph node candidates B2: 3 lymph node candidates B3: One lymph node candidate, bisected. B4-B5: One lymph node candidate, sectioned B6-B8: One lymph node candidate, sectioned C. The third container is additionally identified as, "3. Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, vas deferens ". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 514.6 g, 20.5 x 11 x 5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen. The bladder is 8.5 x 8.5 x 5 cm. The right ureteral stump is 4.5 x 0.5 cm and the left ureteral stump is 3 x 0.4 cm. The prostate is 6.3 x 4.8 x 4.8 cm. The right seminal vesicle is 4.3 x 2.3 x 0.9 cm and the right vas deferens is 11.8 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal vesicle is 4.3 x 2.4 x 1 cm and the left vas deferens is 6.5 x 0.5 cm. There are 2 additional detached segments of vas deferens measuring 3.8 x 0.4 cm and 9.8 x

0.3 cm. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra. The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule and sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity and a 3.5 x 1 x 1 cm area of firm, tan-white induration along the posterior aspect bilaterally. The seminal vesicles contain dilated cystic spaces filled with. tan, gelatinous material. The opened bladder reveals a 3 x 2.7 cm ulceration located in the right posterior/lateral wall with a 5 x 4.2 cm surrounding area of hemorrhagic mucosa. The remaining bladder mucosa is edematous, wrinkled and pink-tan with a uniform 0.2 cm wall thickness. The bladder is serially. sectioned to reveal tumor grossly extending to a depth of 1.4 cm which is 2.4 cm from the inked blue margin. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe patent. Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1: Distal prostatic urethral margin (apex) C2: Right and left ureter resection margin (right side is inked blue) C3-C5: Prostate apex, shaved and serially sectioned C6-C9: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base C10-C13: Representative left lobe of prostate submitted from apex to base C14: Right seminal vesicle and vas deferens. C15: Left seminal vesicle and vas deferens. C16: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, posterior wall C17: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, left lateral wall C18: Hemorrhagic mucosa, dome. C19: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, anterior wall C20-C30: Bladder mass/Ulceration (entirely submitted) with the deepest area of invasion in cassette C20 (with inked margin deep to the area of invasion in cassette C21). D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "left distal ureter stitch on non-margin side". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a rubbery white-tan tubular structure measuring 0.9 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. There is a stitch designating the non-margin side. The margin side is shaved and submitted in D1. lw 4ls[13
