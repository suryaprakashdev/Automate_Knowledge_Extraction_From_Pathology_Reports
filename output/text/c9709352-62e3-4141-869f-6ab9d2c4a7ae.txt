1Cs-0-3 Carcinoma, hepatoclluler, Nos 8110/3 Site Cie: Fvi Ca3.0 Patient Key: Surgical date: REVrsED REpORT (Addendum/Procedure included) TISSUE DESCRIPTION: Al A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 B1 C1 Dl D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 Right lobe liver (1035 grams, 22.7 x 13.8 x 10.6 cm), tissue from the left portal vein (thrombus, 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm), gallbladder (9.2 x 3.1 x 1.3 cm) and peri-choledochal lymph nodes (together measuring 4.1 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm). DIAGNOSIS: Liver, right lobe, resection: Grade 3 (of 4) hepatocellular carcinoma is identified forming a multinodular mass (l5.3 x 13.2 x 7.6 cm) associated with vascular invasion. There are multiple (7) satellite nodules ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 2.7 cm in greatest dimension. Tumor extends to within 0.1 cm of the surgical resection margin. Tumor thrombus is also present within the vein but the vessel margin is negative. Embolic material and coils also identified.  Assessment of nonneoplastic liver to be reported in an addendum. Soft tissue, left portal vein, excision: Positive for hepatocellular carcinoma. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Without diagnostic abnormality. Negative for malignancy. Lymph nodes, peri-choledochal, excision: Multiple (6) peri-choledochal lymph nodes are negative for tumor. ADDENDUM: Non-neoplastic liver shows inactive chronic hepatitis with bridging fibrosis (stage 3), consistent with the patient's known history of chronic hepatitis B.
