Pathologist: ** Report Electronically Sianea By Pathologist: My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Specimen is received unfixed in six parts. Part 1 is labeled with patient's name, initials xx and "tongue base biopsy". It consists of a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm tan-red soft tissue evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of the specimen is submitted labeled 1AFS. Formalin exposure time: 34 hours

Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "right levels 2 thru 4". It consists of a 13.0 x 4.5 x 1.0 cm portion of soft, yellow-. red, hemorrhagic and focally cauterized fibroadipose tissue exhibiting one bulging nodule (5.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm) present within level II. The cut surface is firm, tan-white, lobular and solid. The specimen is divided into levels 2 thru 4. In addition to the dominant level II nodule, multiple soft to moderately firm, tan-gray to pink-red lymph nodes ranging 0.3 to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension are identified on dissection. Representative dominant level II nodule submitted to the Ink Code: Green- external surface of suspicious nodule. Section code: 2A-c- level II, dominate nodule, representative sections. 2D-F- lymph nodes, level II 2G- level III lymph node, (1 bisected). 2H-J- level III lymph nodes 2K- level IV lymph nodes Formalin exposure time: 30 hours. Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "left neck. dissection levels 2 thru 4". It consists of an unoriented 8.0 x 3.7 x 0.9 cm portion of yellow and lobular fibroadipose tissue and red-brown muscle. The specimen is arbitrarily divided into segments A, B and C. Multiple tan- pink to gray, soft lymph nodes ranging 0.3 to 2.3 cm in greatest dimension are identified on dissection.. Section code: 3A-B- lymph nodes, segment A 3C- lymph nodes, segment B 3D-E- lymph nodes, segment c (each one bisected). 3F- lymph nodes, segment C Formalin exposure time: 30 hours Part 4 labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "right base of tongue margin". It consists of a 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan-red soft tissue. evaluated intraoperatively. The remaining tissue is submitted labeled 4AFs. Formalin exposure time: 30 hours Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "total larynx". It consists of a total laryngectomy 9.7 x 7.2 x 4.5 cm, 4.6 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm attached hyoid bone, three tracheal rings and a moderate amount of anterior soft tissue and muscle.. There is a 4.5 x 2.3 x 1.8 cm (depth), well-defined, moderately firm, tan-white, focally hemorrhagic, exophytic supraglottic lesion involving the

right aspect of epiglottis, base of the epiglottis, right false vocal cord and anterior commissure. The ventricle is compressed but grossly the right true vocal cord is uninvolved. On cross-section the lesion penetrates. through the epiglottis invading the para epiglottic fat, coming to within 0.8 cm of the base of tongue mucosal resection margin, 1.0 cm from the anterior soft tissue margin, 0.3 cm from the right aryepiglottic mucosal margin and 4.0 cm from the third tracheal ring margin. The left false and true vocal cords are smooth, soft, pliable and grossly uninvolved. The remaining laryngeal mucosa is smooth, tan-pink-red and mildly. edematous in the glottic region. The thyroid cartilage is unremarkable.. Digital images are taken. The right supraglottic lesion is procured for the clinical tissue bank. Ink code: Black- anterior soft tissue surgical resection. Yellow- soft tissue underlying hyoid bone. Green- base of tongue mucosal margin Red- banked area Section code: 5AFs- radial mid line base of tongue, frozen section. 5B-tracheal ring margin 5D- base of tongue 5E- anterior soft tissue margin, shave 5F- left aryepiglottic mucosal margin, shave 5G- supraglottic lesion in relation to tip of epiglottis. 5hdR- lesion in relation to anterior commissure 5I-5L-lesion in relation to right false cord, ventricle and true vocal cord (midline to lateral) 5M- left false and true vocal cords, uninvolved Formalin exposure time: 30 hours Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "right pyriform". It consists of a 1.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm smooth, pink-gray, soft mucosa and underlying soft tissue entirely submitted labeled 6A..

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu Hybridization Assays (Ish & FIsh), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and Immunofluorescent Testing: The testing was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by the as required by the CLIA '88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the. specific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue. fixation ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of i988 ("cIA") as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical testing. Pursuant to the requirements of cLiA, AsR's used in this. laboratory have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.
