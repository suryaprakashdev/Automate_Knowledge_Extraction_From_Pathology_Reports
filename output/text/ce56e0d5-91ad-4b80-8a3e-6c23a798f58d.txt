FINAL DIAGNOSIS: part 1: breast. Leet, segmental mastectomy - A.  iNVASIVE DUCTAL CARCInOMA, nOTTINGhAm GRADE 2 (TUBULE fORmATION - 3, NUCLEAR GRADE - 2, Mitotic rate - 2; total score 7/9). B. iNVASIVE CARCiNOmA MEASURES 2.0 Cm In GREATESt DIMENSION. C. DUCTAL CARCiNOMA IN-SITU (DCiS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2-3, CRIBRIFORM, SOLID AND MICROPAPILLARY Type, WITh COmeDONecROSiS. D. DCIS IS PRESENT ADMIXED AND OUTSIDE OF THE INVASIVE COMPONENT IN 8 OUT OF 19 SLIDES AND COmpRiSes APprOxImAtely 50% Of the tOtal tumOr VOlumE. E. NO LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. F. MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE COMPONENT, WITH ALL THE MARGINS BEING MORE THAN 1 CM AWAY. G. MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR DCIS; HOWEVER, DCIS IS LESS THAN 1 MM FROM ANTERIOR mARGIN AND 1.5 mm FROm POSTERIOR MARGIN OF RESECTION. H. FiBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH FIBROADENOmATOID NODULE. I. BIOPSY SITE CHANGES. J. INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS ARE WEAKLY POSITIVE FOR ESTROGEN RECEPTOR, NEGATIVE FOR PROgESTErONe RECEPtOR, AND POSITIVe fOR hER-1/NEU (SCORE 3+), AS PER PReVIOUS PATHOLOGY REPORT Part 2: Left Axillary lymph node, Dissection - A.TWO OUt OF TWeLVE Lymph nODeS, POSITIVE fOR MEtaStaTiC CArcInOmA (2/12). B.the Size Of the LArgest metastasis is Over 2 Cm (see comment). NO.EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS SEEN.
