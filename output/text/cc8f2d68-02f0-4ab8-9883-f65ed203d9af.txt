SPECIMENS: A. SIGMOID COLON B. PROXIMAL DONUT C. DISTAL DONUT SPECIMEN(S): A. SIGMOID COLON B. PROXIMAL DONUT C. DISTAL DONUT GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SIGMOID COLON Received fresh for tissue procurement and labeled with the patient's name and "sigmoid colon" is a closed, unoriented segment of colon measuring 13 cm in length with a diameter of 5 cm. There is an area of stricture measuring 1.2 cm, which is 4.5 cm from the nearest surgical margin. This region is inked black. The colon is opened and there is a fungating exophytic polypoid mass with serpentine border measuring 3.9 cm in length with a diameter of 3.0 cm. It appears to invade through the. muscularis propria. It is located 3.5 cm from the nearest surgical margin and approximately 7.5 cm from the distant margin. The mucosa, extending from the mass to its nearest surgical margin, has a granular appearance. Sections of mass and normal appearing mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement. Normal mucosa is submitted for RNA study. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. A1: margin closest to mass A2: margin distal to mass. A3-A4: sections of mass and deep margin A5-A6: granular mucosa A7: normal-appearing mucosa A8-A9: six possible lymph nodes each distal to mass. A10-A11: four possible lymph nodes each in proximity to mass. A12: two bisected lymph nodes adjacent to mass. B. PROXIMAL DONUT Received in formalin and labeled with the patient's name and "proximal donut" is a donut of pink-tan mucosal tissue measuring 3.2 x 2.4 x 0.6 cm. There is a blue suture throughout the specimen. It is bisected and the mucosa is unremarkable. Representative section is submitted in block B1. C. DISTAL DONUT Received in formalin and labeled with the patient's name and "distal donut" is a donut of pink-tan mucosal tissue measuring 2.2 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm. The mucosal surface has pinpoint areas of hemorrhage. There are surgical staple present. Representative section is submitted in block C1. DIAGNOSIS: A. COLON. SIGMOID. SEGMENTAL RESECTION: - INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY AND POORLY DIFFERENTIATED, SEE SYNOPSIS. - 3.9 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. - 3.0 X 1.2 CM IN ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS - INVADING INTO THE SUBSEROSA. - THE PROXIMAL, DISTAL, AND RADIAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. - THE TUMOR IS 3.5 CM FROM THE PROXIMAL MARGIN (CLOSEST MARGIN). - SUSPICIOUS FOR ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION. - NO PERINEURAL INVASION IDENTIFIED. - ASSOCIATED WITH A TUBULAR ADENOMA. - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO TWO OF TWENTY FOUR LYMPH NODES (2/24), WITH EXTRANODAL EXTENSION. B. COLON, PROXIMAL MARGIN, SEGMENTAL RESECTION: - NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED. C. COLON, DISTAL MARGIN, SEGMENTAL RESECTION: - NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED.

Expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 in the tumor was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Peritumoral lymphocytes and normal glands serve as internal positive controls expressing MLH1,. MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Testing for Microsatellite Instability has been ordered. The results will be issued in a separate report.
