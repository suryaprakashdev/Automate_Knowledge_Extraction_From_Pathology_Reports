SURGICAL PATHOLOGY CANCER CASE SUMMARY Procedure Excision without wire-guided localization. Lymph Node Sentinel lymph node(s) Specimen Laterality Left Histologic Type of Invasive Carcinoma Invasive ductal carcinoma (no special type or not otherwise specified) Tumor Size: Size of Largest Invasive Carcinoma Greatest dimension of largest focus of invasion >1 mm: 31 mm Histologic Grade: Nottingham Histologic Score.  Glandular (Acinar)/Tubular Differentiation  Score 3: <10% of tumor area forming glandular/tubular structures Nuclear Pleomorphism  Score 3: Vesicular nuclei, often with prominent nucleoli, exhibiting marked variation in size and shape, occasionally with very large and bizarre forms Mitotic Rate Score 3 (8 mitoses per mm?) (see Table 1) Overall Grade Grade 3: scores of 8 or 9 Tumor Focality Single focus of invasive carcinoma. Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) No DCIS is present Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS) Not identified Margins  Invasive Carcinoma  Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.

FS" is a fragment of adipose tissue that measures 5 x 4 x 2 cm. There are four palpable lymph nodes present. The lymph nodes are bisected and submitted for frozen section (cassette #1Fs). Representative sections of the remaining adipose tissue are submitted in cassette #2. B.Received fresh labeled "Left axillary ..  palpable, FS" is a fragment of adipose tissue that measures 4 x 4 x 2 cm. There are four palpable lymph nodes present. The lymph nodes are bisected and submitted for frozen section in cassettes #1-3Fs. The rest of the specimen is submitted in cassettes #4-8. C.Received in formalin labeled "Left segmental mastectomy (1 suture -superior, 2 sutures --medial)" is a lumpectomy specimen weighing 120 grams and measuring 9 x8 x 3.5 cm, with an unremarkable dark skin ellipse measuring 3.3 x 1.3 cm. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-blue, inferior-green, anterior-yellow, deep-black, medial- red, lateral-orange. Upon sectioning, there is a 3.1 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm well circumscribed, nodular tumor, white-tan, with. an elastic consistency and central cavity. A metallic clip is identified in the central of the tumor. The tumor is grossly. at less than 0.1 cm from the deep margin, 0.4 cm from the superior margin, 1.0 cm from the lateral margin, 2.0 cm  from the medial margin, 2.5 cm from the anterior and skin margin, 4.0 cm from the inferior margin. The rest of the specimen has a cut surface, yellow-tan and homogeneous. Cassettes are submitted as follows: Cassette #1 Tumor in relation with deep and superior margins. Cassette #2 Medial margin Cassette #3 Lateral margin. Cassette #4 Anterior margin (and skin) Cassette #5 Inferior margin. Cassette #6 Area of tumor with clip Cassettes #7&8 8Composite section of the tumor. Cassettes #9-12 Additional sections of the tumor Cassettes #13-15 Representative sections of the rest of specimen.
