Surgical Pathology Report cT2,cN1,cM0 clinical stage II Tissue(s) Submitted: 1: RIGHT BREAST MASS SHORT SUTURE SUPERIOR LONG SUTURE LATERAL 2: RIGHT AXILLARY NODE CONTENTS 3: OMENTUM Gross Description:  Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name and right breast mass, and consists of an 11.3 cm (medial to lateral) x 8.5 cm (superior to inferior) x 4.5 cm (anterior to posterior) product of partial mastectomy which is surfaced by a 6.9 x 2.2 x 0.2 cm ellipse of unremarkable white tan skin. No nipple is identified. A short suture designating.  superior and a long suture designating lateral are present. Two needle localization wires are entering the specimen in the superior  and interior aspects. The specimen is radiographed and differentially inked as follows: superior-blue, inferior-green, lateral-yellow,. medial-red, posterior/deep-black and serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 10 slices. No biopsy clip is identified. An ill- detined, rubbery to tirm, white-tan area measuring 5.3 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm is identitied in slices 4 to 10. This area of tibrous tissue. shows some extensions to the posterior, inferior, superior, and medial margins. This fibrous area is also 2.0 cm trom the overlying. skin. No other lesions are grossly identitied. The breast parenchyma consists of tan-yellow, Iobulated adipose tissue (60%) and fibrous tissue (40%). Time in formalin: Some tumor and normal tissue is frozen for TCGA studies.. Representative sections of all slices (with the exception of slices 2 and 3) are submitted as follows: 1A-1B:  slice #1, lateral margin, perpendicular (representative). 1C-1D: slice #4, irregular fibrous area 1E: slice #4, fibrous area to posterior margin 1F:  slice #4, fibrous area to superior margin 1G-1H: slice #5, fibrous area contiguous section 1: slice #5, posterior margin 1J: slice #5, inferior and posterior margins 1K: overlying skin 1L-1M:  slice #6, contiguous section of fibrous area to inferior margin. 1N-1O: posterior margin 1P: superior margin 1Q-1T:  slice #7, contiguous section from superior to inferior (orange ink denotes contiguous section) 1U: overlying skin 1V: slice #8, fibrous area 1W: superior margin. 1X: inferior margin 1Y: posterior margin 1Z: slice #9, inferior margin 1AA: slice #9, irregular fibrous area 1BB: superior margin. 1CC: posterior margin 1DD-1GG: slice #10, medial margin, perpendicular (representative)..  Specimen #2 is received in formalin labeled right axillary dissection, and consists of 11.0 x 10.0 x 2.5 cm yellow adipose tissue. The specimen was serially sectioned to reveal 16 lymph nodes ranging in size from 1.5 to 4.5 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted and labeled as follows: 2A: Two lymph nodes intact. 2B: Two lymph nodes intact. 2C: Four lymph nodes intact. 2D: One lymph node, bisected. 2E: One lymph node, bisected. 2F: One lymph node, bisected. 2G: One lymph node, bisected. 2H: One lymph node, representative section. 21: One lymph node, representative section. 2J: One lymph node, representative section. 2K-2L: One lymph node, representative section. Specimen #3 is received fresh labeled omentum, and consists of a 20 x 20 x 5.0 yellow lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen is  serially sectioned and no lesion is grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted labeled 3A-33. Page 2 of 3
