SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT ** ADDENDUM REPORT ADDENDUM REPORT: NUMBER TWO Right colon, partial cslectomy: Poorly diffrentiated adenocarcinoma, deficlent gene expression for MLH-1 and Pms-2; intact gene expression for M$h-2 and MSH-6 (immunoh'stochemistry). Ses comn ent.. COmmENT: The tunior is DNA mismatch repair deficient, and should also exhibit high frequency microsatelite instabrity. Most tumors with loss of MLH1 and PhS2 protein e:presslon have primary undertying defects in MLH1 expression, with co-existent loss of exoresslon of the binding partner protein PMS2. In most casts (about so%) MLH1 loss is caused by somatic hypermethylation of the promoter region of the MLH1 gene. This is a common mechanism invoived in the progression of serrated neoplasms of ths right colon. Some individuals with these tumors may have an inherited.  predisposition to the fomation of mutiple serrated neoplasms (hyperplastic/serated polyposis), although tha genetic basis of this syndrome is nknown. These individuals ar > at increased risk of metachronous cancers of tha right colon. About 10% of MLH1 deficient tumors are caused by inherited germmline defects In the MLH1 gene (Lynch syndrome; also know as heredtary non-. polyposis colorectal cancer or HNPcC). The posslbuity of an underlying PMS2 germine defect cannot be axcluded. The tumor doos not reveal a BRAF mutation (see below) which is often seen with somatlc or hypermethylation of the promoter region of the MLH1 gene. But to further clarify a block of tumor is submitted to the Mayo Clinic Laboratory for hypernethylation testing.. Family history evalu ation and additonal testing courd be heipful io detemining if MlH1 loss in the current tumor is caused by methylation or germline. mutation. Genetio counseling and testing should be considered if clinkally Indicated. DNA mismatch repsir deficient cancers are associated with Improved overal survival. Some studies also demonstrate resistance to 5-FU based Chemotherapy and sensitivity to irinotecan (CPT-11). ADDENDUM REPCRT: NUNBER ONE BRAF Mutation Ane lysis SPECIMEN SOURE: COLON PArAFFiN BLOCK NUmBER: iS11-22551, 6 BrAf Mutation Ar alysis: NOt Detecte. This result was revi swed and Interpreted by Based on sequencx: analysis, no mutations were detected in B-RAF exon 11, 12 and 15. Cancer-activating E RAF rrutations can be found in 14% of colorectal cancer, 2% of lung cancer, and 40% of thyroki cancer. Presence of BRAF mutation In colorectal cance: has beon reported to render the tumor resistant to anti-EGFR therapy. Documented BRAf polymorphism is usually not reported and is a neutal variant (no amino acid change). This assay may nol be abl to detect mutation if the tumor constitutes less than 15-20% of analyzed sample. However, we specificaly microdissect tumor and selectively analyze the tumor in the provided tissue. ...... The aRAF mutetion analysis from Qusst Diagnostics uses a DNA-based PCR-sequencing assay to detect somatic mutations on exon 11, 12, and 15 of BRAF, which cove: 102 out of 104 reported mutatfons (99.5% incidence).

BRAF Mutaton^AnaJysis: TNP TNP-TEST REQUEST CANCELLED - NO CHARGE. NORMAL TISSUEI BLOCK FOR NSI Cancer-activating BRAF mutations can bo found in 14% of colorectal cancer, 2% of lung cancer, and 40% of thyrod cancer. Presence of BRAF mutstion in colorectal cancsr has been reported to render the tumor reslstant to anti-EGFR therapy. Documented BRA = potymorphism is usualy not reported and is a neutra! variant (no amino acid change). This assay may nt be ab!e to detect mutation if the tumor constitutes less than 15-20% of analyzed sample. However, we specifically microdissect tumor and selectively annlyze the tumor in the provided tissue. The BRAF mutatic n analysis from Quest Diagnosdcs uses a DNA-based PCR-sequencing assay to detect somatic mutations on exon 11, 12, and 15 of BRAF, which cover 102 out of 104 reported mutations (99.6% incidence). This test was deve loped and its performance characteristics have beon deternined by Performance chanderistics refer to tha analytica! periormance of the test. Test performed at DIAGNOSIS: Right colon, partia! colectomy: Tumor <haracteristics: 1. Histologkc type: Adonocarcinoma. 2. Histologic grade: Poriy differentiated. 3 Tumor site: Ce xum. 4. Tumor size: 12.3 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm. 5. Tumor subtype: Mucinous tumor componant present.. 6. Tumor extensio n: Tunor invades through muscularis propria into adjacent fat to involved inked surface. 7. Margins: Proxin ial margin (smal bowel) - negative; dstal margin - negative; circumferential - (radial) margin - positive (tumor extends to inked Sunface). B. Lymphovascular invasion: Present. Lymph Hode Status:. 1. Nine of sixteen ymph nodes demonstrating metastatic, poorly differentiated carcinoma (9/16). 2. Largest replace  lymph node measures up to 1.4 cm.. Other: 1. pTNM stage: p'T4a, pN2b. CONMENTS: Multiple sections oi the very large tumor reveals a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, composed predominantly of solid nests of cexs having a moderete amount tf cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclel with prominent nucleol. Some rudimentsry gland formation is evident. Eisewhere, there Is a signet ring appeare nce to the ces and also takes of mucin can be identified. The tunor invades transmuraly Into the adjacent fat and focally to the inked surface of the fat (cresuned radial margin). Extensive angiolymphatic invasion is seen within the tunor. Multiple (ymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma (see abxive). Due to the poorly d fferentiated appearance of the neopiasm, a serios of Immunoperoxidase stains are performed. The tumor shows moderate to focally strong immunoreactivity for CK7. A stain for CK20 is negative. The CDX imanunostain reveals some focal Immunoreactivity within tummor cell nuclei. Stains for CK5-S, synaptophysin, PSA, chromogranin and TTF-1 are negative. A stain for calretinin is negative also (no nuclear reactivity). This pattem of immunostalning is sonewhat unusual for a colorectal priknary, since most show CK20 mmuncreactivity and are negative for Ck7. Howover, the focal CDX2 positivity is supportive cf a colorectal primary. In addition, the poony differentiated appearance of neoplasm and the right sided location suggests a possible MS! (micrsatelite instability) high type of lesion. MSI high carcinomas often do show a reverse staining pattern for CK7 and CK20 Immunohistochemi :al stains for mismatch repalr enzymes (evaluation for HNPCC) and/or MSt PCR testing wi! be performed on the tumor and reported as an addendum.d The groin lesion .. . was revlewed as Is a squamous cell carclnoma of the skin..

The specimen is received stapled dlosed at both ends. The serosa i tan-pink and glstening with adherent yelow-tan mesocolonk fat and a portion of omentum. The cecal pouch is remarkable for a 12.8 x 5.0 x 1.5 cr. crcumferential fungating mass that approaches to within 11.0 cm of the ilial margin and 15.5 cm of the colon!c margin.
