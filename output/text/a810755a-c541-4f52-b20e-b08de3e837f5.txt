- NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE NIPPLE BY EITHER IN SITU OR INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.S -. CALCIFICATIONS ARE PRESENT IN THE IN SITU AND INVASIVE CARCINOMA, AND IN BENIGN BREAST PARENCHYMA. EXTENSIVE VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. - NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE SURGICAL MARGINS BY BITHER INVASIVE OR IN SITU CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED. - NO SKIN INVOLVEMENT BY CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.S THE ATTACHED SKELETAL MUSCLE IS UNINVOLVED BY CARCINOMA.S - THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE SHOWS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES ANDS PROLIFERATIVE FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES. - THE LYMPH NODE STATUS IS AS FOLLOWS (EXPRESSED AS THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE LYMPH NODES IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LYMPH NODES BXAMINED) : LEVEL I: 1/10. - THERE IS EXTRANODAL EXTENSION OF CARCINOMA, >2 MM.  IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS WERE PERFORMED ON FORMALIN-FIXED TISSUE WITH THE FOLLOWING RESULTS FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA (BLOCK 5T5) : ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (6F11, 90% NUCLEAR STAINING WITH STRONG INTENSITYS PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (1E2; 60% NUCLEAR STAINING WITH MODERATE INTENSITYS HER2 (HERCEPTEST; DAKO): 2 NEGATIVE (STAINING) INTENSITY OF 0) CONTROLS ARE SATISFACTORY. COMMENT : HERCEPTESTTM (DAKO) IS AN FDA-APPROVED METHOD FOR ASSESSMENT OF HER2 PROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION IN BREAST CANCER TISSUE ROUTINELY PROCESSED FOR HISTOLOGICAL EVALUATION. THE HER2 TEST RESULTS ARE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ASCO/CAP GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HER2 TESTING IN BREAST CANCER (J CLIN ONCOL 2007; 25(1):1-28). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. * Report Blectr ically Signed Out *** Special studies: Result Special Stain Comment ER-C PR-C HER2-C IMM RECUT NEG CONT NEG-HER2 Gross Description: ** Continued on next page **

MD D. 1.)  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "level 3 left axillary lymph nodes" and consists of two irregularly shaped fragments of yellow lobulated adipose tissue measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. No lymph nodes are identified grossly. The specimen is entirely submitted.. Summary of sections: U-undesignated 2.  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "level 2 left axillary lymph nodes" and consists of one irregularly shaped fragment of yellow lobulated adipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm. Three possible lymph nodes are identified, ranging from 0.3 cm to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted.. Summary of sections: U -- undesignated 4.D. 3.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled -lateral left breast skin" and consists of one irregularly shaped fragment of yellow to tan fibroadipose tissue measuring 10.3 x 2.9 x 1.4 cm. No skin is identified grossly.  Serial sectioning reveals a grossly unremarkable fibroadipose tissue with a single possible lymph node measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted.. 3 Summary of sections: U-undesignated .D. 4.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "right upper abdominal skin tag" and consists of one polypoid shaped fragment of brown skin measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U-undesignated .D 5.) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left breast and level 1 axillary lymph nodes, stitch marks level 1 axillary lymph nodes" and consists of a breast with attached axillary tail. The breast measures 22.2 x 16.0 x 3.5 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 16.6 x 7.9 cm. Situated eccentrically on the skin surface is an everted nipple measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm and areola measuring 4.9 x 4.1 cm. The skin shows no scars. A suture demarcates the axillary tail which measures 9.8 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm. The posterior surface of the breast is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an irregularly shaped white-tan firm mass. ** Continued on next page **

involving upper outer, lower outer and upper inner quadrants, located 0.6 cm away from the deep resection margin. The remaining breast tissue shows predominantly yellow lobulated adipose tissue admixed with scant white-tan fibrous soft tissue with no other grossly identifiable lesions. The axillary tissue is dissected to reveal multiple lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm.  The specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection.. Representative sections of the. mastectomy specimen and all identified axillary lymph nodes are . submitted Tissue submitted for TPS.
