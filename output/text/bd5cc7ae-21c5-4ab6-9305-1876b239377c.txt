Other significant findings: None. AJcc Staging: pT1a pNx This staging information is based on information available at. the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information.. Clinical History: -year-old female with renal masses. Gross Description:. Received are four formalin-filled containers.. Container A is additionally labeled "renal mass #l." It consists. of a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm fragment of pink/tan rubbery tissue that. is inked blue, bisected and submitted in block Al, Container B is additionally labeled "base of tumor #l." It consists of a 0.4 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm fragment of soft pink/tan tissue submitted in block Bl, Container c is additionally labeled "renal mass #2." It consists of a 1 gram (1.6 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm) partial nephrectomy that has a. 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm well circumscribed smooth tan rubbery nodule.. The nodule abuts the capsule (inked yellow) and is 0.3 cm from the parenchymal margin (inked black). The specimen is sectioned perpendicular to the parenchymal margin and submitted in blocks c1 and c2. Container D is additionally labeled "renal mass #3." It consists of a 17 gram (3.4 x 3.1 x 3.0 cm) partial nephrectomy. Approximately 75% of the cut surface is involved by a 2.7 x 2.7 x 2.5 cm well circumscribed smooth tan rubbery nodule that bulges the capsule (inked yellow) and is 0.5 cm from the parenchymal margin (inked black). A portion of the nodule is. given to. and perpendicular sections. of nodule with capsule is submitted in block Dl, and. perpendicular sections of nodule with parenchymal margin is submitted in blocks D2-D4.. hJ 7/3o/s
