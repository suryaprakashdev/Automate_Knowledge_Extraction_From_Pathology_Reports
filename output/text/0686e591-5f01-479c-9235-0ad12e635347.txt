D: Sections of the bladder show a poorly differentiated invasive urothelial carcinoma (D1-3,9-11,13,14), grade 4/4, with focal clear features.  The carcinoma is associated with extensive ulceration and penetrates through the bladder wall into perivesical soft tissue (D1,2,10,11). A focus of lymphovascular space. and 1.2 cm of the bladder neck margin. All other radial margins and bilateral ureters margins are more widely free of malignancy. No trigone or ureterovesical junction involvement by dysplasia or malignancy is seen.  Metastatic urothelial. carcinoma is identified in one of three left perivesical lymph nodes examined D21-23. Sections of the uterus show a small focus of well differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma, FIgo grade 1/3, arising in association with endometrium and a polyp containing complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia (Dl5-17). No myometrial or cervical invasion is identified.' Ali surgical margins are free of malignancy. E-Q: See final microscopic-diagnosis.. h 3f3yi4
