Redacted ICDO3 Surgery date:  Surgical Pathology serscorenmo, ductN6S REVISED REPORT (Revised information underlined) 880D|3 Site: Sancreas heaol DIAGNOSIS: D. Pancreas, head, duodenum, gallbladder, and common bile duct, C86.0 portion jejunum, pyloro-sparing Whipple resection: Invasive grade 3 JtJ s/s/1 y (of 4) ductal adenocarcinoma is identified forming a solid 4.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm mass causing a stricture of the distal common bile duct. The tumor extends beyond the pancreas to involve the peripancreatic. soft tissue. It infiltrates into the muscularis propria of the duodenal wall and the adventitia of superior mesenteric vein (a 4.0 cm segment of superior mesenteric/portal vein resected on block is present). Perineural invasion is present. Tumor necrosis is absent. All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, less than 0.1 cm, anterior soft tissue margin). Multiple (5 of 34) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. The gallbladder is unremarkable. A. Lymph nodes, hepatic artery, biopsy: Multiple (2) lymph nodes are negative for tumor. B. Pancreas, neck margin, excision: Positive for tumor. A lymph node is also metastatically involved. C. Pancreas, body margin, excision: A microfocus of carcinoma is present. E. Vein, superior mesenteric, margin, excision: Negative for tumor. F. Vein, portal margin, excision: Negative for tumor. G. Hepatic duct, margin, excision: Invasive adenocarcinoma is present in the soft tissues surrounding hepatic duct nearly circumferentially. H. Hepatic duct, new common margin, excision: Negative for tumor With available surgical material, [AJCC pT3N1] (7th edition, 2010) Frozen section histologic interpretation of hepatic artery lymph nodes, neck of pancreas margin, and body of pancreas margin, performed by:. This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes

Received fresh labeled "hepatic artery lymph nodes" is a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes submitted. Grossed by B. Received fresh labeled "neck of pancreas margin" is a 3.2 x 2.1 x 0.5 cm portion of pancreatic tissue with orientation. All submitted. Grossed by C. Received fresh labeled "body of pancreas margin" is a 3.8 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm portion of pancreas with orientation. Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by. D. Received fresh labeled "head pancreas, gallbladder, duodenum, common bile duct, portion jejunum" is a Whipple specimen consisting of 27.0 cm in length of portion of duodenum, 6.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm portion of pancreas, a 4.0 cm segment of superior mesenteric vein/portal vein, and a 12.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm gallbladder. The pancreatic uncinate margin is inked yellow and shaved, the portal vein groove is inked black and submitted perpendicularly. There is a 4.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm diffusely infiltrative mass within the. pancreatic head, 0.9 cm from the neck margin. The mass extends to portal vein and duodenum. The gallbladder contains no choleliths. Peripancreatic lymph nodes and periduodenal lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by E. Received fresh labeled "SMV margin" is a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm portion of blood vessel with orientation. All submitted. Grossed by
