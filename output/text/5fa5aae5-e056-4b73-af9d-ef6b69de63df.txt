YJ s/B0/i4 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A fresh intact right globe. Dimensions: Axial 26.5mm Horizontal 25.5mm Vertical 26mm Cornea: Horizontal 12mm Vertical 12mm. Optic Nerve: Length 35mm Diameter 4mm.. On trans-illumination, a shadow is seen approximately 14mm. posteromedially. Plane of Section: Horizontal. Intraocular description:. On opening, a solitary domed shaped piebald choroidal mass is seen approximately 3mm away from optic disc. Tumoux Size: 12mm Height 7mm MICROSCOPY Histologically, the enucleated eye demonstrates a normal. anterior segment with an unremarkable cornea, a deep anterior chamber and open angles. The iris leaves are unremarkable. The lens shows advanced cataractous changes. In the posterior segment, close to the optic nerve head, a. choroidal melanoma can be seen. This is dome-shaped with a large accompanying exudative retinal detachment with haemorrhage. The retina overlying the tumour is atrophic with degenerative changes..

The melanoma celis are immunoreactive  for MelanA, CDi17 and Hsp-27 (score 2). The number of mitoses is approx. 7/40 high power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, and closed loops are present in the tissue planes evaluated. The lymphocytic infiltrate within tumour is minimal. Macrophages are scattered throughout the tumour in a moderate density.There is no evidence of scleral invasion or of extraocular growth. The optic nerve is tumour free, and demonstrates mild atrophic changes.  The examined vortex veins are free of tumour. FINAL DIAGNOSIS Choroidal melanoma of mixed cell type. COMMENT Molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the. tumour celis will be performed using multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLpA). looking at chromosomes 1 3, 6 and 8. A supplementary report will follow as soon as these investigations are complete. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT In the meantime MLpA was performed on the DNA extracted from. the tumour material. The MLpA results demonstrate: Borderline gains of chromosome 1p 2 borderline losses and 4 borderline gains in chromosome 3 2 borderline gains in chromosome 6p Normal chromosome 8q. The molecular genetic results are unclear and so MsA will. be performed to clarify the status of chromosome 3. A final report will follow. Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verifled:

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT In the meantime, MsA was performed on the DNA extracted from. the tumour sample and compared with that extracted from the patient blood. The MsA results suggest that there is no loss of. heterozygosity (NLoh) for 2 of the three 3 loci examined on. chromosome 3p, and NLoh for 3 of four loci on chromosome 3q. These results are consistent with disomy 3. COMMENT Taking the mLpA and msA results together, they would suggest that the status of chromosome 3 in the tumour cells is. normal (i.e. disomy 3)..
