SP: Vena cava, additional, biopsy:. -Portion of vein with detached atypical cells admixed with fibrin in the lumen, favor reactive: no definite tumor seen (sce comment) 4. SP: Lymph nodes, left perihilar, resection: Lymph Nodes:  Number of nodes examined:10 Number of metastatic nodes:8 The largest metastatic node is 2.5cm  Perinodal (extracapsular) extension identilied The largest metastatic deposit neasures 2.Scm in greatest dimension 5.  SP:Lymph nodes, paraaortic, resection: Lymph Nodes:  Number of nodes examined:18 Number of metastatic nodes:13. The largest metastatic node is 3.5cm Perinodal (extracapsular) extension identified  The largest melastalic deposit measures 3.5cm in greatest dimension SP:Lymph nodes, aortocaval, resection: t.ymph Nodes: Not involved Number of nodes examined:4 7. SP: Henia sac, abdomen, repair: -Benign mesothelium lined fibrovascular and adipose tissue, consistent with hernia sac. Comnenl: The lunor cells are negative for CK7, 34BE 12 and racemase, and show focal faint staining with AE1/AE3 and CA-IX. BAF-47 slain is non-contribulory.Among the diagnoslic po ditary leiomyoma renal cell carcinona (HLRCC) should be considered. Selected parts (1, 2, 3 and 5) reviewed witl who concurs. Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISh tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Dnug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These lesls are used for clinical purposes. They shouid not bo tigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ol  qualified to perlorm high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

RACEMASE 34BE12 NEG CONT IMM RECUT BAF-47 CA-1X.  NEG CONT Gross Description 1)The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "caval wall rule out lumor invasion" and consists ol tan-pink tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm. Entirely submilted for trozen section Summary of sections F$C -- frozen section control 2) The specimen is received fresh and subscquenlly placed in formalin labeled "left kidnoy and adrenal gland, fresh and sterile" and consisis of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 1007 g in total. The kidney measures 19 x 12.5 x 8.5 cm. The atlached ureter measures 9 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. Tho attached renal vein measures 5.5 cm in Jengih and 1.7 cm in diameter. The arterial and ureteral margins are grossly unremarkable. The vein is dilated with frm. adherent, yellow-red possible blood clot obstructing the lumen. Aiso in the pelvis are multiple firm to rubbery nodules, some of which appear lo be positive lynph nodes. An orange-yellow. hemorrhagic adrenal gland is identified near the hilum and measures 5 x 3 x 1.5 cm. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal an 8.5 x 7.5 x 6 cm yellow-tan to red-brown, henorrhagic, friable, pseudoencapsulated mass in the upper pole which grossly invades through the renal capsule. Scattered are mulliple ovoid, circumscribed lesions which grossly involve the pelvis. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveals scant. uninvolved  pink brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures up to 1.2 crn and the calyces are almost entisely intiltrated with tumor. Also in the container are multiple, irregular portions of red-yellow, friable, possibly necrotic soft tissue and red-brown blood clot representing possible at. eiditional portions of the upper pole tumor. The specimen is photographed. Representative seclions are submitted fo. d for permanenl sections.

AVC -- additional vena cava 4) The specinen is received in formanr Lell pemmar lymph nodes and consists af a 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm from of a tissue. fragment, which is sectioned to reveal five, firm, red purple lymph nodes, ranging from O.3 to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. The larger lymph nodes are bisected or trisecied and ail lymph nodes are entirely submilted..

The targer lymph nodes are hisected and all lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

All four lymph nodes are bisected and are entirely submitted. Summary of seclions: BLN -- bisected lymph nodes focally falty, tan-purple fibromombranous tissue iragment. wilh mulliple congested lobules of adipose tissue.
