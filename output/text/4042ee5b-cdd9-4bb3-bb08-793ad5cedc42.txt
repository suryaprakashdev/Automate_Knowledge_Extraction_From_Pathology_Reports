LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND C. PARA AORTIC LYMPH NODE D. RIGHT LOWER LOBE LUNG WEDGE RESECTION E. RIGHT LOWER LOBE NODULE/WEDGE #2 F. RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE NODULE/WEDGE CLINICAL HISTORY:S PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. PORTION OF 10TH RIB Received fresh with patient's identification and designated "portion of 1Oth rib" are 2 tan pink bone segments, 3.2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm and 4 9 x 1.2 x 1 cm, show no grossly visible lesions, representatively submitted in cassette A1, following decalcification.. B. LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND Received fresh with patient's identification and designated "left kidney and adrenal gland" is a left kidney with peri renal fat and the attached adrenal gland, weighing 1243 g, with overall measurements of 24.0 x 9.5 x8.5 cm (the kidney measures 10.5 x 7.5 x 4.5 cm, the adrenal gland measures 13.5 x 9.5 x 8.5 cm). The specimen is inked blue. The attached segment of ureter measures 3 cm in length, 0.5 cm in diameter, the renal vein measures 1 cm in length, 0.5 cm in diameter and the renal artery measures 1 cm in length by, 0.3 cm in diameter. Upon bivalving the specimen, the kidney shows tan-brown cortex. with a well defined cortico-medullary junction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth, glistening mucosa and shows no grossly visible lesions/masses. The attached adrenal gland is diffusely enlarged, grossly appears to encroach on to the kidney, with no grossly visible invasion and shows, variegated and hemorrhagic cut surface.. Examination of the peri renal fat reveals no grossly visible nodes/masses.. Examination of the soft tissue and fat around the adrenal gland shows 9 tan-white to tan- pink, firm to hard nodes, 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm. Gross pictures of the specimen taken and specimen submitted for procurement.. Representatively submitted in 27 cassettes as follows: B1-- Ureter & blood vessels B2-B5 - sections of kidney including renal pelvis. B6-B7 = sections of kidney with attached adrenal gland

B8-B20 = random sections of the enlarged adrenal gland B21-B22 = random sections of the perirenal fat B23-B27 = nodules near the adrenal gland (B23 - 5 nodules, B24 - 2 nodules, B25-B27 - bisected single nodes) B28-B32 = additional sections of tumor and capsule C. PARA AORTIC LYMPH NODE Received fresh with patient's identification and designated "parotid lymph node" is a tan-. white to tan-pink, fibro fatty soft tissue fragment, 4.4 x 4.2 x 1.9 cm. The attached fat. measures 2.2 x 3.2 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. The specimen is inked with black ink and the cut section reveals 2 tan-pink, soft to firm lymph nodes, 3.2 x 2.2-1.2 and 3.8 x 2.3 x 2.1 cm, grossly appear to be matted. Examination of the attached fatty tissue reveals a tan- pink, firm to hard possible lymph node, 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm. Representative section of the. matted lymph nodes and the bisected, entire smaller lymph node submitted in 4 cassettes. as follows: C1-C3 - full-thickness section of the matted lymph nodes, C4 = bisected smaller lymph node. D. RIGHT LOWER LOBE LUNG WEDGE RESECTION Received fresh with patient's identification and designated "right lower lobe lung wedge resection" is a lung wedge, 35.8 g, and 9 X 4.5 x 3 cm. Frozen section analysis was performed and reported as poorly differentiated carcinoma, favor metastasis. The pleural surface is tan-pink without any grossly visible lesions. The stapled margin is. inked blue and the pleural surface is inked black. Serial sectioning of the specimen after removal of the stapled margin reveal a tan-white, firm to hard nodule, 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, seen located 1 cm from the resection margin. Representatively submitted in 6 cassettes as follows: D2-D3 - sections from the nodule D4-D5 = sections from the adjacent lung parenchyma D6-D7 = sections from the normal appearing lung parenchyma E. RIGHT LOWER LOBE NODULE/WEDGE #2 Received fresh with patient's identification and designated "right lower lobe nodule/wedge #2" is a lung wedge, 2 g, 4.2 X 1.2 x 0.3 cm. The pleural surface is tan- pink without any grossly visible lesions. The stapled margin is inked blue and the pleural. surface inked black. Serial sectioning of the specimen after removal of the stapled margin reveal a tan-white to tan-pink, area 0.3 x 1.2 cm seen located 0.2 cm from the resection margin. Submitted entirely in 3 cassettes, E1-E3. F. RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE NODULE/WEDGE Received fresh with patient's identification and designated "right middle lobe nodule/wedge" is a lung wedge, 35.8 g, 9 x 4.5 x 3 cm. The pleural surface is tan-pink without any grossly visible lesions. The stapled margin is inked blue and the pleural

surface is inked black. Serial sectioning of the specimen after removing the stapled margin reveals a tan-pink to tan-white, rubbery, firm to hard nodule, 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm is seen located 1 cm from the resection margin. Representatively submitted in 6 cassettes as. follows: F1-F2 = sections from the nodule F3-F4 = sections from the adjacent lung parenchyma F5-F6 = sections from the normal appearing lung parenchyma DIAGNOSIS: A.
