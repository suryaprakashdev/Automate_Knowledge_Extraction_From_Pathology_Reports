2.Excisional biopsy margins:Free of tumor -Invasive carcinoma is 2 mm from closest (inferior) margin - Additional margins greater than 2mm away 3.Blood vessel and lymphatic invasion:Absent 4. Axillary lymph nodes: Positive for tumor, (1/14) -Size of largest metastatic deposit: 1 mm -Extranodal extension:Absent 5. Special studies (see ): - Rare tumor cells (less than 1%) immunoreact with ER and PR -Her2/neu antigen (FiSH): Negative (ratio =1.04) 6.pTNM:pT1c,N1mi, MX Clinical History: The patient is a year-old female with a history of right breast mass undergoing right breast lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. Comment Cytokeratin stains are performed on the sentinel node (blocks A1 and A2) However, the microscopic focus of carcinoma is not present on the deeper sections used for IHC.

Specimens Received: A:Sentinel Lymph Node Right Breast #1 B: Right Breast Lumpectomy C: Right Axillary Contents Gross Description: The specimen is received in three containers, each labeled with the patient' s. name and medical record number. A. Container A is additionally identified as '1. sentinel lymph node, right breast #1.' Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm blue-tan, ovoid lymph node candidate. The specimen is bisected and entirely frozen in cassettes A1FS-A2FS and read as'A1FS-A2FS positive for metastatic tumor < 2 mm'per Dr. The frozen section remnants are entirely submitted in cassettes A1FS-A2FS B.Container B is additionally identified as'2. right breast lumpectomy; long stitch lateral, short stitch superior.' Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 113.8 gm, oriented lumpectomy specimen. The specimen measures 7.2 cm from lateral to medial, 11.0 cm from anterior to posterior, and 3.0 cm from superior to inferior. The specimen is oriented with a double short suture at superior. and a double long suture at lateral.

The specimen is inked as follows:. superior blue inferiorblack anterior green posterior red The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into ten slices. The central aspect of the specimen, within five slices, is notable for a well-circumscribed, centrally spiculated, indurated, otherwise solid, firm, white-pink mass. The mass measures 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm and abuts both the inferior (black) and inferior/posterior (red/black) margins, diffusely.The second slice from the lateral aspect of the mass shows an identifiable metallic clip. The remainder of the specimen is devoid of additional discrete lesions and is otherwise composed of soft, yellow tissue (85%) and intermixed, glistening and soft, white parenchyma (15%) Block summary: B1-B2:lateral margin, serially sectioned B3-B105: entire specimen from lateral to medial, respectively B106-B107: medial margin, serially sectioned (Mass in cassettes B27, B28, B36-B39, B54-B57, B74-B77; clip in cassettes B36-B39.)
