TCGA-B9-4113 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Diagnosis: A: Kidney, left,laparoscopic nephrectomy. Renal cell carcinoma,papillary type grade 2 (of 4, Furhman classification),5.8 cm diameter,extending into but not through capsule, without angiolymphatic invasion, surgical margins not involved. -Medullary fibromata,multiple. B:Testicle, right, orchiectomy. -Benign testicular parenchyma, mild decreased spermatogenesis, no neoplasm identified. C: Testicle, left, orchiectomy -Benign testicular parenchyma,mild decreased spermatogenesis, no neoplasm identified. Comment: None. Clinical History: Patient is with a clinical diagnosis of prostate carcinoma and a renal mass, in for left laparoscopic nephrectomy and bilateral orchiectomy. Gross Description: Received are three appropriately labeled containers. Container A is additionally labeled"left kidney." Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: laparoscopic nephrectomy Size and weight of specimen: 650 grams,approximately 19x 11x5.2 cm nephrectomy specimen Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent Tumor description: there is a well circumscribed soft yellow lower pole mass; the majority of the inner portion

of the mass is markedly hemorrhagic; there are no cysts or areas of calcification noted; the mass is in the medulla but is compressing the pelvis Tumor size:approximately5.8x4.0x2.9 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent Confinement/Non-confinement to kidney: confined Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: tumor does not grossly involve Renal vein: tumor does not grossly involve Ureter: tumor does not grossly involve Other organs: n/a Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: grossly negative Renal vein: grossly negative Renal artery: grossly negative Ureter:grossly negative Description of kidney away from tumor: The remainder of the kidney is pink/tan with a relatively distinct corticomedullary junction with a cortex measuring approximately0.6 cm, the medulla measuring approximately 1.3 cm; additionally,there are three firm, white nodules noted in the cortex up to 0.5 x 0.3 x0.3 cm;these nodules do not grossly resemble the main tumor mass. Lymph nodes (hilar): No hilar lymph node candidates are palpated. Tissue submitted for special investigations: A small section of tumor and normal tissue were given to Tissue Procurement. Block Summary: Al - ureter and hilar vascular margins A2 - tumor and adjacent kidney A3 - tumor and capsule, tumor and adjacent kidney A4,A5 -additional tumor A6 - representative from three firm white cortical nodules A7,A8 - representative normal kidney A9 - representative hilar fat A10 - additional possible ureter margin

Al1 -lymph node candidates Container B is additionally labeled "right testicle." It holds a 37.1 gram, 5.5 x 3.0 x2.5 cm testiclewith approximately3.5x 1.2 x 1.0 cm attached epididymis.The external surface of the testicle and the epididymis is tan, smooth and glistening. The external surface is inked blue to exhibit grossly unremarkable orange/pink, soft testicular parenchyma. The tunica vaginalis is approximately O.1 cm thick, intact and grossly unremarkable. The testicular parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. No masses or lesions are identified in either testicular or epididymal cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted per block summary. B1 -spermatic cord margin B2-testicle B3 - testicle and epididymis Container C is additionally labeled "left testicle." It holds a 40.3 gram5x3.3x3.0 cm testicle with attached approximately 5.5 x2.0 cm epididymis.The external surface of both the testicle and epididymis is tan, smooth and glistening. The external surface is inked blue and the testicle is bivalved to exhibit orange/brown soft testicular parenchyma with no gross lesions or masses identified. The tunica vaginalis is intact and on average 0.1 cm thick. Sections are submitted as per block summary. C1 - spermatic cord margin C2 -testicle C3- testicle and epididymis Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed Histologic tumor type/subtype: renal cell carcinoma/papillary subtype Histologic grade if applicable grade2 of4,Furhman classification) Tumor size greatest dimension): grossly 5.8 cm diameter Extent of tumor invasion: Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: extension into

but not through capsule in block A3 Renal vein: not involved Ureter: not involved Blood vascular: not identified Lymphovascular: not identified Depth of invasion: Adjacent organs: no adrenal received Histologic assessment of surgical margins: negative Adrenal gland: not included Lymph nodes: none sampled Other significant findings: non-neoplastic kidney shows scattered medullary fibromata
