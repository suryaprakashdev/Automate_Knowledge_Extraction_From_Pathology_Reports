Surgical Pathology Report Year old female with right central ILC and + LN, left prophylactic. cT2,cN1,cM0, clinical stage IIB Tissue(s) Submitted: 1: LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY SUTURE MARKS SHORT SUPERIOR AND LONG LATERAL 2: RIGHT BREAST MASTECTOMY SUTURE MARKS SHORT SUPERIOR LONG LATERAL 3: RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS Gross Description: Specimen #1 is received fresh labeled left breast mastectomy suture marks short superior and long lateral and consists of a 719 designating lateral. There is a 13 x 4.5 cm eliptical portion of white skin on the anterior aspect displaying a 1 x 1 x 0.3 cm everted nipple. No skin lesions are appreciated. The posterior margin is intact. The specimen is inked as follows:. Superior-anterior- blue Inferior-anterior- green Posterior- black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal two indurated foci within the fibrous tissue, one located retroareolar located approximately 3 cm deep to the nipple. The retroareolar nodule measures approximately 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and is 2 cm from the anterior margin and 6.5 cm from the deep margin. Approximately 3 cm lateral to the aforementioned nodule is an additional 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm ill-defined tan rubbery to indurated nodule located at the junction of the lower outer and upper outer quadrant, 3 cm from the deep margin and 4.5 cm from the nearest anterior inferior margin. The remaining cut surface consists of approximately 75% yellow lobulated adipose tissue and 25% scattered white rubbery micronodular fibrous tissue. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A-1B: retroareolar indurated nodule (no margins) 1C: closest anterior and posterior margins to retroareolar nodule. 1D: skin overlying retroareolar nodule 1E: nipple 1F-1G:  lateral nodule (no margins) 1H: posterior and nearest anterior margin to lateral nodule 1: upper outer quadrant 1J: upper inner quadrant 1K: lower outer quadrant 1L: lower outer quadrant. Please note all representative quadrant sections contain no margins.. Time in formalin: submitted same day. Specimen #2 is received fresh labeled right breast mastectomy suture marks short superior long lateral and consists of an 833 gram, 23 x 18 x 4 cm right total mastectomy specimen with two attached sutures, short designating superior and the long designating lateral. There is an 11.5 x 4.2 cm white elliptical portion of skin on the anterior aspect, which displays a 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm everted nipple. There is a 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm raised tan-white nodule located on the skin at 4 o'clock, 0.8 cm from the 4 o'clock margin. The posterior margin is intact. The specimen is inked as follows:. Superior-anterior- blue Inferior-anterior- green Posterior- black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 3 x 2.8 x 2.0 cm ill-detined markedly indurated tan-white irregular mass located predominantly in the upper inner quadrant and extending retroareolar. The mass is located 4 cm from the distal margin and 2.2 cm from the overlying skin. The specimen is radiographed and two clips are identified located in contiguous slices. Palpably the two clips are present within the same mass. The mass is located within 1.1 cm of the nearest anterior margin. The remaining breast parenchyma consists ot approximately 75% yellow lobulated adipose tissue and 25% scattered white rubbery nodular fibrous tissue. No additional masses are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. 2A-2D: representative sections of mass, one section per contiguous slices to include both areas surrounding clips 2E: representative deep margin and mass 2F-2G:   mass to nearest anterior margin 2H:  nipple and skin nodule to closest margin (green 4 o'clock margin). 2l: upper outer quadrant 2J: lower outer quadrant Page 2 ot 3

Surgical Pathology Report 2K: lower inner quadrant 2L: upper inner quadrant. Time in formalin: submitted same day Specimen #3 is received in formalin labeled right axillary content and consists of a 10 x 7 x 3 cm aggregate of fat in which multiple Iymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.1 cm to 2.3 cm in greatest dimension. Some ot the larger lymph nodes are sectioned to reveal white and focally firm cut surfaces possibly consistent with tumor. The lymph nodes are submitted in its entirety with the exception of the largest grossly polypoid lymph node as follows: 3A: tive lymph nodes 38:  six lymph nodes 3C-3G:  each cassette contains one lymph node bisected 3H-3J:  one lymph node trisected 3K: representative section of largest grossly positive lymph node. 3L: one lymph node bisected. 23413 Page 3 of 3 END OF REPORT
