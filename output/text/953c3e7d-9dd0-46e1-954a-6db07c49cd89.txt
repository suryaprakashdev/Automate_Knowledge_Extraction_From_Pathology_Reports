The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Urethral margin", and consists of one piece of tan soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm.The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis. Summary of sections: FSC -- frozen section control 2. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "right distal pelvic lymph node", and consists of a piece of adipose tissue. The specimen is dissected to reveal multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 4.1 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: BLN -- bisected lymph nodes LN1 -- lymph nodes LN2 -- largest lymph node, serially sectioned Page 3 of 6

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 3. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "left distal pelvic lymph node", and consists of portion of adipose tissue. The specimen is dissected to reveal multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 4.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm in greatest. dimension.All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: BLN -- bisected lymph node LN1 -- one lymph node, serially sectioned LN2 -- largest lymph node, serially sectioned 4. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles and perivesical lymph nodes". It consists of a  bladder and prostate measuring 18.4 cm from superior to inferior, 15.0 cm laterally, and 4.6 cm from anterior to posterior. The  bladder measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.2 cm, the prostate measure 3.2 x 3.6 x 3.0 cm, the right seminal vesicle measures 4.1 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm, the right vas deferens measures 3.1 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter, the left seminal vesicle measures 3.1 x 1.6 x 0.7 cm,  and the left vas deferens measures 4.7 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked black and the posterior blue. The right lobe of the prostate is inked green; the left is inked black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved  and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal a tan firm tumor measuring 2.0 x 1.1 cm which is grossly situated within the posterior wali of the bladder. The lesion lies 1.2 cm from the left ureteral orifice and 1.1 cm from the right.  ureteral orifice. Both ureters are probe patent and measure up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal  the tumor invading the bladder wall. Extension to the inked fat is grossly not identified. The remaining bladder mucosa is pink-red congested and focally hemorrhagic. No perivesical lymph nodes are identified. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal pink  tan parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted including sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone.
