There is an anterior ellipse of skin measuring 16.5 x 7.5 cm with an eccentric 2.7  cm areolar complex with everted nipple. Sections of nipple areola are sampled in block 1. The skin surface shows a 4 cm long scar located near the lateral margin and is sampled in~block 2. The superficial superior. margin is inked orange and the superficial inferior margin is Inked green. The deep margin is inked black and the specimen sectioned, showing a firm pale tan mass measuring 4.2 x 3.7 x 2.9 cm. The mass is located in the upper inner and lower inner quadrants..  The mass grossly extends to the. inked deep margin and is 1.7 cm from the superficial. superior margin and 1.9 cm from the superficial inferior margin. The skin overlying the mass is disrupted.  Sections breast is composed of yellow lobulated adipose tissue admixed with 1slands of gray-white rubbery tissue.. breast is divided into four quadrants, upper inner, The inner, upper outer and lower outer and sampled in blocks lower 8-1l respectively.  No axillary tissue is grossly. identified. Formalin fixation time is approximately 12 hours. DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Breast, right simple mastectomy:.
