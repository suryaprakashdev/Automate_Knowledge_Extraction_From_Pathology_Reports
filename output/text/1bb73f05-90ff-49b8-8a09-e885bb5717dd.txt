Patient: Case # FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT  Signeu uy Source of Specimen: A. Peritoneal bx B. Umbilical bx C. Liver bx D. Pancreaticosplenectomy E. Transverse mesocolon Clinical History/Operative Dx:  Pancreatic cancer Intraoperative Diagnosis: A. Peritoneal biopsy (FSA1): - Adenocarcinoma. B. Umbilical nodule, resection (FsB1): - Adenocarcinoma. Reported by The intraonerative interoretation(s) was/were performed and rendered at. Gross Description: A. Part A is designated as peritoneal biopsy. Initially received in the fresh state for frozen section evaluation is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm red-tan nodular piece of soft tissue. The specimen is bisected and one half is submitted for frozen section evaluation. The residual frozen tissue is submitted in A1 for permanent sections and the remaining half is submitted in A2 for routine histology.. 3. Part B is designated as umbilical biopsy. Initially received in the fresh state for frozen section evaluation is a lobular and tattered portion of fatty soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Sectioning reveals a red-tan nodule, 1.7 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. One half of the nodule is submitted for frozen section evaluatlon. The residual frozen tissue is submitted in B1 for permanent sections and the remaining half of the nodule including attached fat is submitted in B2 for routine histology.. C. Part C is designated as liver biopsy. Received in formalin is an irregular fragment of deep tan-brown soft tissue consistent with liver parenchyma, measuring 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected Case #: Page 4 Printed: This report continues... (FINAL) MR No thology - Page 4/6 - Page 4 Doc#1

Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOgy REPORT revealing a circumscribed, glistening, light gray nodule, 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted in its entirety between two sponges bisected in C1.. D. Part D is pancreaticosplenectomy. Initially received in a fresh state for harvesting tissue for is a pancreaticosplenectomy consisting of spleen, distal pancreas, adrenal gland,. and two attached pieces of stomach. The dimensions of the pancreas is difficult to discern due to replacement by tumor that invades the surrounding soft tissue; however, is up to 10.0 cm in length and 4.3 x 1.9 cm. Sectioning through the stapled proximal margin of resection reveals tan pancreatic parenchyma without gross tumor involvement. Upon sectioning transversely, reveals a wel-demarcated tumor mass, grossly 1.8 cm from the pancreatic surgical margin and measuring upwards of 8.0 x 4.3 x 3.5 cm. The tumor mass is dense, light gray and demonstrates obvious involvement into the peripancreatic soft tissue within 0.2 cm of the anterior and posterior radial surfaces. The apparent adrenal gland is slightly distorted, measures upwards of 4.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm, and is partially encased and involved by tumor grossly (D11-D12). The remaining length of the pancreas is grossly involved with tumor with the likely distal end of the tail demonstrating poorly visualized lobular, yeilow-tan fat and possible pancreatic parenchyma (D9-D10, contiguous sections). A smaller plece of attached stomach is 4.3 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm, deep red-tan and is incised to reveal prominently wrinkled, deep tan mucosa without gross tumor involvement (D13): A larger wedge-like piece of stomach is 5.9 x 2.0 cm and is red-tan with submucosal tumor involvement (D16). The grossly involved area is greater than 1.0 cm away from the stapled surgical margin. The tumor grossly invades the hilar fat up to.the spleen and encasing the splenic vessels. The spleen is 8.7 x 7.6 x 3.3 cm with a glistening, deep purple-tan intact capsule. The spleen is serially sectioned revealing deep red parenchyma without discrete nodularity or grossly invasive tumor component. Lymph nodes searched within the hilar region and superior peripancreatic fat is hindered by tumor replacement. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation. Cassette summary: D1-D2) proximal pancreatic margin of resection, contiguous sections,. D3) proximal end of pancreas and adjacent tumor relationship,. D4-D10) representation of tumor replaced pancreas, submitted in a sequential fashion proximal towards distal end, D11-D12) adrenal gland - tumor, D13) small wedge of stomachl, surgical margin, submitted,. D14-D15) larger wedge of stomach, surgical margin trimmed and submitted,. D16) stomach wedge with tumor involvement,. D17-D18) spleen with hilum and tumor. E. Part E is transverse mesocolon biopsy. Received in formalin is a 4 gram piece of lobular and slightly tattered fatty soft tissue, 3.3 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm. A double suture denotes an area of palpable, poorly visualized nodularity. This surface is now marked orange and the remaining margins biack. Examination reveals deep yellow-tan, dense nodularity measuring up to 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm surrounded by glistening. yellow fat. The nodularity is within O.3 cm of the likely surgical margin (black). The lesion is entirely submitted for. Case #: Page 5 Printed: This report continues... (FINAL.). athology - Page 5/6. 5 Doc# 1

Patient: Case #: FINAL SurGiCAL pAThOLOgy REpOrt microscopic evaluation in E1 and E2 with additional representation of the fat in E: Microscopic Description: A. Sections of the peritoneal biopsy show peritoneum with attached skeletal muscle partially involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma forming irregular glands with surrounding desmoplastic stroma. No Iymphovascular invasion is identified. B. Sections of the umbilical nodule show adenocarcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue. The tumor is at the cauterized edge of the fragment. No lymphovascular invasion is identified. C. Sections of the liver biopsy show a subcapsular focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma. A portion of  benign liver tissue is present. No lymphovascular invasion is identified. D. Sections of the pancreaticosplenectomy show an invasive adenocarcinoma involving the tail of the pancreas. The tumor forms irregular small glands with a surrounding desmoplastic stroma. There is a minor cord and single cell patten. The nuclei are enlarged with prominent nucleoli and there is cytoplasmic mucin. Perineural invasion is present and there is a focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion. There are some dilated pancreatic ducts with severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. The invasive tumor invades into the surrounding peripancreatic soft tissue with involvement of the left adrena! gland and tibrovascular bundle of the splenic hilum without direct invasion into the splenic parenchyma. The larger wedge of attached stomach has tumor invading through the wall up to the mucosa. It cannot be determined if this focus is due to direct extension or metastatic spread. A single benign peripancreatic lymph node is present. The pancreatic margin is uninvolved. E. Sections show mesenteric tissue with foci of adenocarcinoma composed of irregular small glands surrounded by desmoplastic stroma. No lymphovascular invasion is identified.
