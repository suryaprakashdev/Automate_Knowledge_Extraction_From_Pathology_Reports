There is no tumour extension through optic nerve or vortex veins examined. Tumour, however, infiltrates through the sclera emerging on scleral surface and loosely attached episcleral tissue. Therefore completeness of excision may not be guaranteed. Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is deep. The iris shows no significant abnormality but the ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of  ciliary processes. The lens shows glassy appearance. Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic.. DIAGNOSIS Left eye, enucleation: Choroidal melanoma of predominantly spindle cell type with extrascleral infiltration.
