Left breast and axilla (fresh) 1 short suture superior; 1 long suture lateral:. by immunohistochemistry. -The cells of intradermal nevus are positive fo , PhD Clinical History:. Patient is a -- I white female with history of left breast cancer. Pre Operative Diagnosis: Right breast cancer. Specimen(s) Received: A: Right breast 1 short stitch superior, 1 long stitch lateral (fresh). B: Right axillary node (perm) C: Left rotter lymph node (perm) D: Left breast and axilla (fresh) 1 short suture superior; 1 long suture lateral Gross Description: A. Received fresh and labeled *right breast 1 short stitch superior, 1 long stitch lateral" specimen consist of right breast oriented with 1 short stitch superior resection margin and 1 long stitch in lateral resection margin, 18.0 x 15|0 x 5.0 cm and weighs 775.0 grams. The skin mesures 13.0 x 8.0 cm, nipple measures 1.2 cm and the areola, 4.0 cm in citcumference. Sections reveal abundant grossly unremarkable fibroadipose tissue. The central area reveal white-tan, fibrdcystic area, 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. No tumor or any other lesions are grossly identified. Representative sectionslare submitted in ten cassettes as follows: Perpendicular representative sections from superior resection margins 2  Perpendicular representative sections from inferior resection margins. 3 Perpendicular representative sections from medial resection margins. +  Perpendicular representative sections from lateral resection margins. 5 Representative sections from nipple 6 Perpendicular representative sections from deep resection margins. 7-10 The lesion described submitted in toto (fibrocystic areas) 11 Representative from upper outer quadrant 12 Representative sections from lower outer quadrant 13 Representative sections from upper inner quadrant 14  Representative sections from lower inner quadrant B. Received in formalin and labeled 'right axillary node" specimen consist of yellow-tan, fibroadipose tisseu, 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Section reveal two lymph nodes. The lymph nodes submitted in toto in one cassette bissected each.. Page 2 of 3

SURGICAL PATHOL Report C. Received in formalin and labeled "left rotter lymph node" specimen consist of one lymph node, 6.0 x 5.0 3.0 cm and weighs 35.0 grams. Sections reveals pink-tan, well defined multinodular . No calcified or hemorrhagic areas are grossly identitified. Representative sections are submitted in eight cassettes: D.  Received fresh and labeled *left breast and axilla 1 short suture superior; 1 long suture laterat" is a masteqtomy specimen with axillary contents, weighing 1150.0 grams and measuring 21.0 x 21.0 x 6.0 cm and the axillary contents, 14.0 x 12.0 x 2.0 cm. There is an anterior ellipse of white skin, 20.0 x 10.0 cm. Located centrally within this ellipse of skin there is a nipple areola complex 3.5 cm in circumference and 1.0 cm in circumference. Located toward the outer quadrant there are two verrucose shaped hyperkeratosis lesions, 0.7 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The remainder of the skin surface is unremarkable. The rest of the specimen is covered by yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue. The surgical resection margins are inked din black. Multiple cross sections reveals an ill circumscribed gray-tan, hard greatly ma$s, 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. The mass is located in the outer quadrant approximately 1.00 o'clock position, 1.5 cm|from the superior resection margin (nearest margin) and 2.5 cm from deep resection margin. Located in the same quadrant 2.5 cm from the mass previously described there is a second ill circumscribed gray-tan, hard nodule measuring 2.4 cm in greatest dimension, this mass is 2.8 cm from deep resection margin (closest margin). The remainder of the specimen shows a heterogeneous breast tissue. No other lesions or masses are grossly identified. The stroma to fat ratio is 3p.70. Multiple sections through the axillary contents reveal eighteen possible lymph nodes ranging in size from, 0.3 cm to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1 Superior resection margin nearest to the 1.00 o'clock mass 23 Inferior resection margin  Medial resection margin 4 Lateral resection margin 5 Deep margin closest to 1.00 o'clock mass (outer upper quadrant) 6 Deep margin ciosest to the second mass (outer upper quadrant) 7 Representative sections from the areola and nipple 8 Representative sections from the skin wit verrucose lesion 9-11  Representative sections from the mass at 1.00 o'clock (outer upper quadrant) 12-14 Representative sections from the second mass (outer upper quadrant) 15  Representative sections from inner upper quadrant 16 Representative sections from inner lower quadrant 17 Representative sections from outer lower quadrant 18-20 One lymph node multisected 21-23 One lymph node multisected 24&25 One lymph node multisected  26-33 One lymph node bisected per cassette 34 Four possible lymph nodes submitted in toto 35 Three possible lymph nodes submitted in toto ICD-9(s): 174.8 196.3 216.5 31/ Page 3 of 3
