SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLAE C. LEFT BREAST WLE SPECIMEN(S): A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLAE C. LEFT BREAST WLE GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "SLN #1, left axilla" is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm possible lymph node. The tissue is serially sectioned and touch imprints are performed. The specimen is entirely submitted, A1-A2 B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "SLN #2, left axilla" is a 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm possible lymph  node. The tissue is serially sectioned and touch imprints are performed. The specimen is entirely submitted, B1. C. LEFT BREAST Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast" is an oriented (short-superior, long-lateral) 26 gm, 5.8 x 5.1 x 1.8 cm lumpectomy. Ink code (previously inked in OR):.  anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned into seven slices revealing a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm stellate, gritty white tumor that is closest to the anterior. margin at less than 0.1 cm. Tissue is procured. Also, identified is a second 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, firm tan-white. suspicious nodule that is closest to the inferior margin at 0.2 cm. The second nodule is at least 0.4 cm inferior to the. tumor. No additional masses are identified. Representative sections:. C1-C2-slice 7. inferior margin, perpendicular C3-slice 6, tumor-lateral half. C4-slice 6, tumor-medial half C5-slice 5, tumor to anterior margin C6-C7-slice 4, tumor to anterior and posterior margins. C8-slice 2, representative posterior and lateral margins C9-slice 1, superior margin, perpendicular DIAGNOSIS: A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (O/1). B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (O/1) C. BREAST, LEFT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 1.2-CM - SATELLITE INVASIVE TUMOR, MEASURING 1 MM, PRESENT 2.5 MM FROM POSTERIORE - INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT AT ANTERIOR SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN - INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, CRIBRIFORM TYPE WITH FOCAL NECROSIS - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST Specimen Type: Excision Needle Localization: No Laterality: Left Invasive Tumor.

- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF TWELVE AXILLARY LYMPH NODES (1/12), MEASURING 3.5-CM WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF TWO INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODES (1/2), MEASURING O.8-CM WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE B. LYMPH NODES, ADDITIONAL LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS, DISSECTION: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).  NOTE: Four tumor nodules are grossly identified. Microscopically 3 of them are invasive ductal carcinoma that have the same morphology and one is DCis. The tissues in between these nodules show scattered foci of DCIS.. Therefore, these foci may be interconnected through DCis. Largest confluent invasive tumor measures 2.5-cm. Two intramammary lymph nodes are identified, one is positive for metastatic carcinoma SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST Specimen Type: Mastectomy Needle Localization: No Laterality: Left  Invasive Tumor: Present Multifocality: Yes  WHO CLASSIFICATION  Invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS 8500/3 Tumor size: 2.5cm Tumor Site: Upper inner quadrant Lower inner quadrant Margins:  Negative Tubular Score: 3 Nuclear Grade: 2 Mitotic Score:  3.
