A x 1.5 cm wedge biopsy of brown skin and underlying fatty tissue. The specimen is bisected lengthwise and totally submitted in blocks Al and A2.. B.  Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "left breast lumpectomy. stitch marks area of interest" is a 7 gram aggregate of fibroadipose tissue. The specimen measures 6 x 5 x 2 cm. There is one portion which is sutured. and this portion measures 4 x 2 x 1.5 cm. On cross section. this portion shows an admixture of adipose tissue and. streaky gray-white tissue possibly representing tumor.. A section of this portion is submitted in blocks B1-B3.  Additional sections of the other fragments of tissue are. submitted in blocks B4-B6. C.  Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and "left breast" are several fragments of firm. fatty tissue which measure together 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm. A representative portion of the firmer area is submitted in block C1 for frozen section. A cytologic scrape prep is prepared for Diff-Quik stain. The complimentary tissue submitted for frozen section is provided to the Tissue Bank coordinator.  The remainder of the soft tissue is submitted in block c2 for permanent section.. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: E-cadherin stains on specimens B and c demonstrate that they are positive.. Control block stained appropriately. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: C . FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS.
