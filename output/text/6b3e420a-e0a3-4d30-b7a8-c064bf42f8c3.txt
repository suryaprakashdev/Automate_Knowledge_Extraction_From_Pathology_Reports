E: Antrum, duodenum, head of pancreas, common blle duct, and proximal jejunum Clinical History: Adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas.. (C) Stitch marks marginal.. Intraoperative Consullation: FSA1: Perlcaval lymph node: No carcinoma(1 block), FSB1-FSB2: Hepatio artery lymph node: No carcinoma (2 blocks) FSC1: Bile duct margin: No carcinoma (1 block). FSD1: Panoreatic marain: No carcinoma (1 block). Gross Description: (A) (pericaval lymph node) Recalved fresh for frozen section evaluation of metastatlc disease Is a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. red-yellow, fatly tissue fragment. The specimen is bisected and submitted in toto in cassette F$A1.. (8) (hepatlc artery lymph node) Recelved fresh for frozen sectlon evaluation of metastatic disease is a 2.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm, tan, rubbery lymph node. The speclmen is blsected and submitted in toto in cassettes FSB1 and FSB2 (C) (bile duct margin) Received fresh for frozen seclion evaluation for margins is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm, tan-red, donut shaped tissue fragment. The specimen is submitted in toto in FSC1. (D) (pancreas margin) Recelved fresh for frozen section evaluatlon for margins is a 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm, tan-red, fragment of pancreas. The speclmen Is submitted In toto In FSD1. (E) (antrum, duodenum, head of pancreas, common bile duct and proximal Jejunum) Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin after sectlons were taken for Tumor Bank are a previously opened antrum of stomach (13.3 x 5.7 x 0.3 cm wall thlckness), duodenum (21.5 x 7.1 x 0.7 cm wall thickness), pancreas (5.3 x 2.7 x 2.4 cm), bite duct (5.0 cm In length by 1.0 cm in dlameter), and gallbladder (9.3 x 2.7 x 1.7 cm). The posterlor aspect of the pancreas has been inked black, the anterior yellow, uncinate margin green, vascular notch margln purple, and pancreatic duct margin red. The bile duct is opened longitudinally revealing dilatallon of the bile duct, A longltudinal sectlon through the blle duct and duodenum reveal no gross invasion of pancreatic tumor into the ampulla or duodenum. Sectioning through the pancreas reveals a firm, tan leslon within the head of the pancreas thal measures 1.8 x 2.2 x 2.8 cm. The tumor appears to be invading into the duodenal wall but not into the duodenal

mucosa. The lesion is located approximately 1.0 cm away from the uncinate margin, approximately 1.8 cm away from the pancreatic duct margin, and at least 1.0 cm away from the posterior pancreatic margin. The antral stomach mucosa is tan and rugated without lesions or ulcers. The duodenal mucosa is tan and rugated with congestion of the distal aspect. No Ieslons or masses are Identified In the duodenum. The serosal surface of the gallbladder is gray-purple and glistening. The gallbladder Is opened revealing a wall thickness of 0.3 cm and a mucosa that is velvety, purple-gray. No stones or lesions are identlfled. Palpatlon and dissectlon reveal seven tan potential perigastric lymph nodes that range in slze from 0.3 to 0.7 cm In greatest dimenston. One tan potential lymph node is found inferior to the pancreas measuring up to 0.6 cm In greatest dimension. Slocks submitted: E1 - pancreatlc duct margin. E2-E3 - proximal slomach margin. E4-E5 - distal small bowel margin. E6-E7 - unclnale margin E8-E9 - longitudinal section through ampulla and duodenum E10-E12 - representative sections through pancreatic tumor E13 - tumor to stomach E14 - representative section through stomach. E15 - representative sectlon through duodenum. E16 - reprosentative seclions through grossly uninvolved Dancreas E17 - representative section of the gallbladder including a cross section of the cystlc duct. E18 - seven potentlal perigastric lymph nodes E19 - one potentlal inferlor pancreatic lymph node. Microscopic Description: Complete mlcroscopic evaluallon has been performed..

Unless otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for. ERPR by lHC, Har2 by IHC and/or HER2 by FISH have been fixed as per ANP.22998 for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 48 hours. ER, PR, Kl-67, p53 are reported as a semi-quantitative percentage of positively stalned nuclel. Her-2/neu and EGFR are scored as follows: No staining at all is scored as (0), weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is scored as (1+), less than slrong but complete staining In any proportion of cells or complete strong staining In less than 30% of cells is scored as (2+), and strong complete staining In more that 30% of cells is scored as (3+). All studies are performed on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin unless otherwise stated in the report..
