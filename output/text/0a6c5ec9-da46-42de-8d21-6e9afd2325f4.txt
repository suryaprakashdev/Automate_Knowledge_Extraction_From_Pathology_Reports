TSS: Non-neoplastic areas: Hormone receptor status (by IHC): ER: pending. PR: pending HERCEPTEST (by IHC): pending Pathologist Electronically signed - ADDENDUM The ER/PR/HER2 status of the invasive breast carcinoma was determined by immunohistochemistry and quantitated via ACiS (image analysis). Results are as follows: Er 0% PR 0% HER2 0.0% A separate ACIS report has been generated.. NOTE: FiSH analysis for HER2 gene amplification has not been ordered. SPECIMEN(S): A.

WIDE EXCISION RIGHT BREAST Gross only: Tumor about 0.8cm. from anterior margin, reported to Dr. by Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A.  SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY #1 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh in a single container labelled and designated "sentinel lymph node bx #1 right axilla" and consists of a single 1.5x1.1x0.4cm. lymph node with tan cut surfaces and associated unremarkable adipose tissue. A touch preparation is made from the lymph node. The entire specimen is submitted in. a single cassette labelled A1.. B.  SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY #2 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh in a single container labelled and designated "sentinel lymph node bx #2 right axilla" and consists of a single 1.3x1.3x0.4cm. lymph node with tan cut surfaces and associated unremarkable adipose tissue. Touch preparations are made from the lymph node. The entire specimen is submitted in a single cassette labelled B1.. C. WIDE EXCISION RIGHT BREAST Received fresh in a single container labelled and designated "wide excision right breast cancer with needle iocalization" and consists of a single 8.5x7.5x3.0cm. resected portion of breast tissue. A single. stitch of suture indicates the anterior aspect and a double stitch indicates the lateral aspect. A.

TSS. Iocalization wire is present within the specimen. A radiograph is also received with the specimen and shows a radiographic density in the region of the tip of the wire. The margins of resection is inked as follows: inferior orange, superior red, lateral yellow, anterior blue, medial green, posterior black. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior and a 1.5x1.5x1.2cm. tan grey well circumscribed tumor is identified. The tumor does not approach any of the margins grossly. However, it is within approximately 0.8cm. of the anterior (blue) margin. The tumor is at least 1.5cm. away from all the other margins. A small portion of tumor is submitted for tissue procurement as well as a portion of uninvolved breast parenchyma. The remainder of the cut surfaces are remarkable only for multiple small cystic nodules all 0.3cm. in diameter or less. Multiple sections including approximately 95% of the tumor are submitted and labelled as follows:.. Code of sections: C1-C2: tumor approaching anterior margin. C3: tumor C4-C5: tissue adjacent to medial margin C6-C9: breast with cystic nodules D.  RIGHT BREAST CYST,excision Received in formalin in a single container labelled and designated *right breast cyst" and consists of a single portion of firm tan yellow fibrofatty tissue measuring 3.7x2.7x2.2cm. No orientation is given. The resection margin is inked. The specimen is serially sectioned and located centrally is a 1.2cm. diameter cyst. The inner lining is smooth and tan. The remainder of the cut surfaces are composed of unremarkable adipose tissue with streaks of breast parenchyma. All of the cyst is submitted in cassettes D1 through D6.  RE-EXCISION INFERIOR LATERAL MARGIN RIGHT BREAST Received in formalin in a single container labelled and designated "re-excision inferior lateral margin right breast" and consists of a portion of tissue measuring 2.0x1.7x1.5cm. A short stitch of suture indicates the inferior aspect of the specimen and a long stitch indicates the lateral aspect which is the new margin. The new margin submitted in a single cassette labelled E1 en face. The remainder of the specimen is serially sectioned and the cut surfaces show unremarkable adipose tissue and breast. parenchyma.Remainder of specimen submitted and labelled E2-E9.
