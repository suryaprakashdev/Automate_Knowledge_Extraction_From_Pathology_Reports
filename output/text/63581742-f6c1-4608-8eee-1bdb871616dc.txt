EXCISION LEFT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification, "Excision Left Breast" is a 130g, 8 x 11 x 4cm oriented (Single-Anterior, Double-Lateral, Triple-Superior) left lumpectomy with 5 x 2 cm tan pink unremarkable skin ellipse.. Ink Code: Anterior-Yellow, Posterior-Black, Medial-Green, Lateral-Red, Superior-Blue, Inferior-Orange. The. specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 8 slices to reveal a 3 x 3 x 2.3cm gray white firm ill defined. mass, 0.5cm from the closest anterior-superior margins in slices 3-6. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1: medial margin slice 1 A2-A3: superior margin slice 2 A4: area next to mass slice 2 A5: skin slice 3 A6: mass with anterior margin slice 3 A7: mass with deep margin slice 3 A8: mass with anterior margin slice 3 A9: mass with deep margin slice 3 A10: anterior/superior margin slice 4 A11: superior margin slice 4 A12: mass with anterior margin slice 4 A13: mass with deep margin slice 4 A14: mass with anterior margin slice 4 A15: mass with anterior/inferior margin slice 4 A16: mass slice 4 A17: deep margin slice 4 A18: deep/inferior margin slice 4 A19: mass with anterior margin slice 5 A20: superior margin slice 5 A21: mass slice 5 A22: mass with deep margin slice 5 A23-A24: anterior margin slice 5 A25: mass slice 5 A26-A27: mass with deep margin slice 5 A28-A29: mass with anterior margin slice 6 A30-A31: mass slice 6 A32: deep margin slice 6 A33: next to mass slice 7 A34-A35: deep margin slice 7 A36: lateral margin slice 8 B.

E. LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS Received in formalin is a piece of yellow-tan adipose tissue, 9.5 x 0.5 x 2.7 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.1 to 2.7 cm. The larger lymph nodes are bisected and have variegated pink-tan coloration. There is a blood vessel, 0.9 cm and the length and 0.4 cm in diameter, which is clipped at both ends. It contains blood clot. Specimen is submitted entirely:.

TPC-TPD: Positive for Adenocarcinoma. Diagnoses called to Dr. at (A) and C-Dby Dr ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen:  Surgical Excision Block Number: A16 Interpretation: POS!TIVE Intensity: 3+ % Tumor Staining: 100% Fish Ordered: No METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no iess than 8 and nn Innna ar than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit using rabbit anti- human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified controi tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,. information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. Gross Dictation: Pathologist. Microscopic/Diagnostic Dictation: Patholoaist.
