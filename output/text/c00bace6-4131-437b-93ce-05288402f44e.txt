(SEE COMMENT) Site: CKidney NDS Margins of resection free of tumor. 649 Adrenal gland, no tumor present.. METASTATIC PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IN THREE OF THREE LYMPH NODES. (B) PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODES: METASTATIC PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IN MATTED LYMPH NODES (SEE COMMENT) COMMENT The papillary renal cell carcinoma is composed of papillae lined by tall columnar cells. Most tumor cells have eosinophilic cytoplasm, and some cells have clear cytoplasm. These morphologic features are consistent with type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma. The tumor appears to be confined to the kidney and does not show invasion into the renal sinus adipose tissue, perinephric fat or the renal vein. The para-aortic lymph nodes (specimen B) involved by metastatic renal cell carcinoma are matted together, hence the exact number of lymph nodes cannot be assessed. In addition to tumor in the lymph nodes there are small foci of tumor within vascular. lymphatic spaces in the perinodal adipose tissue.. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT KIDNEY WITH REGIONAL LYMPH NODE, VACCiNE PROTOCOL - A radical nephrectomy specimen (21.0 x 15.0 x 8.5 cm) including the left kidney (12.5 x 11.0 x 7.3 cm), a segment of renal artery, the renal vein and ureter (1.4 cm in length and 0.5 cm average diameter) and the adrenal gland (5.5 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm). There is a 10.0 x 8.5 x 8.5 cm well circumscribed tumor in the lower/mid pole of the kidney. The tumor is tan-gray and friable with focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis throughout. The tumor is well circumscribed and does not grossly invade into perinephric adipose tissue, renal sinus, or renal vein. The tumor does not extend to Gerota's fascia. Three enlarged lymph nodes (0.6 to 2.9 cm in greatest dimension) are identified in the hilum of the kidney. These are grossly involved by tumor. The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. Serial cross sections of the left adrenal gland show unremarkable cortex and medulla. Tumor has been submitted for the vaccine protocol. Portions of the tumor have also been submitted for possible electron microscopy. Photographs were obtained. INK CODE: Blue - Gerota's fascia. SECTiON CODE: A1, renal vein, renal artery, and ureter margins; A2, adrenal gland, representative sections; A3, tumor with nearest soft tissue margin; A4-A6, tumor and adjacent uninvolved kidney; A7, A8, tumor and renal sinus; A9-A12, representative sections of tumor; A13, one hilar lymph node, representative section; A14, one hilar lymph node, representative section; A15, one hilar lymph node bisected. (B) PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE - Three irregular fragments of soft tissue (8.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm in aggregate). On cut surface it appears to be a matted aggregate of variegated white-yellow-red tumor. No residual lymph node tissue is grossly identified. Representative sections submitted in B1-B5. CLINICAL HISTORY None given. SNOMED CODES T-71000, M-83123, M-Y1593, T-C4400, M-83126, M-Y1596
