COrY DIAGNOSIS: 1. Kidney, left (left radical nephrectomy): Renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe-type, with areas of high-grade sarcomatoid differentiation. Tumor approaches but does not go through the capsule. Vascular and ureteral margins are free of tumor. Adrenal gland, no tumor seen. 2. Lymph nodes, retroperitoneal (excision): Reactive lymph nodes with marked sinus histiocytosis, no tumor seen. CLINICAL INFORMATION: HISTORY:LEFT RENAL MASS PROCEDURE: PREOP DX:#LEFT RENAL MASS POSTOP DX: LEFT RENAL MASS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: VERY LARGE LEFT RENAL MASS AND ENLARGED HILAR LYMPH NODES SPECIMENS SUBMITTED: 1) KIDNEY, LEFT NEPHRECTOMY 2) RETRO PERITONEAL LYMPH NODE GROss DEscRIPTION: Received in two formalin containers labeled with the patient's name and medica! record number, and as:. 1. "Left kidney" is a large soft tissue specimen weighing 3,800 grams measuring 22 x 18 x 15 cm. The ureter. is marked with yellow ink and the vessel is marked with blue ink. The adrenal gland is,identified. Once cut, there is a large, extensively red mass lesion without gross evidence of fibrosis, scarring,'or encapsulation. This. mass lesion occupies a major portion of the specimen. There is a small rim of normal appearing renal tissue with a maximum dimension of 8 cm. For procurement, samples of both normal renal tissue and the mass. lesion are sent to  The specimen is placed in formalin but other portions are submitted in ethanol as a touch prep and also as electron microscopy. The special instructions are confirmatory for culture, frozen, and touch prep.. Patient Identification Page 1
