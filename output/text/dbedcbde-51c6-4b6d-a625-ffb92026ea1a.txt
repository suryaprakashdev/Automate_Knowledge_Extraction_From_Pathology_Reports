Surgical Pathology Report Cornment: Small intraductal papillomas present. Hormone receptors were performed on previous specimen : E. Sentinel node #3: One lymph node posltive for metastatlc lobular carcinoma. The deposit  measures 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. Superticlal extranodal extension is present.. PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pT2, pNX, pMX All three nodes samp!ed are positive and, therefore, the nodal stage Is at least pN1a.. NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure Is transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as requlred for accreditation by the Commisslon on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely upon the current tissue speclmen being evaluated  and does not Incorporate other relevant data. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining the clinical stage and shouid not be contused with nor substituted for it. The exact operative procedure is avallable in the surgeon's operative report. Clinlcal History Breast carcinoma. Gross Descriptlon "A" - The specimen is received in formalin labeled "right breast". It consists of an unoriented mastectomy specimen without axillary tissue measuring 18 x 17.5 x 4 cm and welghing 719 grams. There is an. overlying tan-white ellipse of skin measuring 12.2 x 9 cm showing a slightly eccentric, wrinkled pale tan areola, measuring 4.5 x 4.5 cm. In the center of the areola, there is an everted pale tan soft nipple measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm. There are grossly no biopsy sites or healed incislons on the skin surface. The deep margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal lobulated fat interspersed with a moderate amount soft-to-firm pink-tan nonfatty breast tlssue. There are scattered pink-tan soft circumscribed nodules measuring up to 0.4 cm in diameter. Also noted are cysts tilled with brown fluid measuring up to 0.3 cm in diameter. There Is grossly no evldence of mallgnlty. Representative sections are submitted in seven cassettes. Block summary: "A1" - vertical sectlon of nipple; *A2" - cross section of nipple; "A3" - tissue underlying the nipple; "A4 -"A7" - tlssue and nodules from each quadrant with the cyst Included in cassette "4". The specimen Is revlewed with. "B" - The specimen Is received in formalin labeled "sontinel node #1". It consists of a flrm pink-tan lymph. node and attached fat measuring overall 1.5 x 1 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is bisected and totally submitted in cassette "B". "C" - The specimen is received in formalin labeled "sentinel node #2". It conslsts of a pink-tan lymph node with attached fat measuring overall 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. The speclmen is bisected and totally submitted in cassette "C". "D" - The specimen is received In formalin labeied "left breast". It consists of an unoriented mastectomy. specimen without axillary tissue measuring 20 x 17 x 4 cm and weighing 744 grams. There is an overlying tan-white ellpse of skin measuring 11.5 x 8 cm showing a slightly eccentric, wrinkled pale tan areola, measuring 4.5 x 4.5 cm. In the center of the areola, there is an everted pale tan soft nipple measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm. There are grossly no blopsy sites or healed incisions on the skin surface. However, a papule is identifled 0.3 cm from the nearest margin of the skin ellipse, measuring 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The deep margin is inked black and the specimen Is serially sectloned to reveal a firm pale pink-tan mass which appears to Page 2 of 3 Surgical Pathology Report - Page 2/

Surgical Pathology Report. be within the upper outer quadrant measuring 3.4 x 3 x 1.2 cm. The mass comes to within 1.8 cm of the deep margin and 1 cm of the nearest superticlal margin (inked blue). The mass comes to within 3.2 cm of. the nipple. The deep margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal lobulated fat interspersed with a moderate amount soft-to-firm plnk-tan nonfatty breast tissue. The tumor shows. adjacent linear and focal areas of Induration extending predominantly lateral and medial. No lymph nodes are grossly identified at the axillary margin. Representative sections are submitted in 12 cassettes. Block. summary: "D1" - vertical section of nipple; *D2* - cross section of nlpple; *D3" - tumor and nearest superficial margin; "D4" - tumor and nearest deep margin; "D5" - tumor away from the surglcal margin; "D6". and "D7" - irregular firm tissue approximately 1.5 cm medial to the tumor within the upper inner quadrant,. "D8" and "Dg" - Irregularly frm tissue within the upper outer quadrant lateral to the tumor, "D10" - lower Inner quadrant; "D11" - lower outer quadrant; "D12* - tissue underlying the nipple. The specimen Is. roviewed with 1. "E" - The specimen is received in formalin labeled "sentinel node #3". It consists of a tan-yellow portion of. fatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. Sectioning reveals a pink-tan lymph node measuring 1.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. the lymph node is totally submltted in cassette "E"..
