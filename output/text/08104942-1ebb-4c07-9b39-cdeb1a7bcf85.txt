RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTSE  Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient name designated "a. right axillary contents" is a portion of. red-yellow firm adipose tissue measuring 10.1 x 8.5 x 3.7 cm. Multiple firm enlarged lymph nodes are identified, ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 up to 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: B14 ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8.. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. r) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Mouse anti-human ER and PR, Comment: This assay Ca.: t'e used to select invasive breast cancer patients for hormone therapy (1). ER and PR analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) antibody provided by Dako, following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (1). information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department 1.

Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2, HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit), '.). Control Slides Examined: External kit-slides  provided by manufacturer (cell tines with gn, row ana negative HER2 protein expression), and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma identified for HER2 evaluation. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System. IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern.  Negative (O)/Absence of Staining  Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not  indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT  This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical  Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall.  survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was determined as iHC 3+ or FiSH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2  protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3).. HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and  adherence to allinstruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the  reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and  guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and

guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported results. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FiSH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The Iaboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE 1.
