Tumour thrombus in Lt renal vein. 0 Biopsy of tumour for genetics studies. L MACROSCOPIC: 0 The specimen consists ot an en block resection of kidney, adrenal, renal vein G and surrounding tat. The kidney is 120x 80 x 60mm. Medial and superior to the kidney there is a mostly encapsulated tumour, 140 x 130 x 110mm. The Y tumour does not invade into the kidney parenchyma but is separated trom the kidney by a narrow rim of fatty tissue. On sectioning, there is foca! extension through the tumour capsule into the surrounding perinephritic fat, up to 13mm in depth. The tumour also invades directly into the adjacent rena! vein forming a nodular tumour mass, 30 x 20 x 20mm in the vein lumen. The stapled resection margin of the renal vein appears abutted by the tumour mass. The cut surface of the tumour has a yellow/tan neterogenous appearance. It is variegated and haemorrhagic in areas. The tumour weighs 826g. The adjacent kidney appears normal on sectioning. At the hilum the artery 3omm in length, renal vein 7omm in length, and ureter 5Omm in length are identified. The renal A vein is involved as described previously, No lymph nodes are found despite careful examinatlon ot the peri-renal and peri-adrenal tissue.. N Block 1: renal vein margin with tumour thrombus. Block 2: ureteric and renal artery margins A Blocks 3,4: tumour invading through capsule and extending into perinephritic T fat Blocks 5-7: further tumour invading directly into renal vein 0 Blocks 8-11: further tumour from variou$ areas. M Block 12: normal kidney 1 c MICROSCOPIC: The 826g 140 mm tumour is a high grade adrenal cortical carcinoma. The A carcinoma displays 8 ot the 9 Weiss criteria of malignancy. It is composed predominantly ot pleomorphic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. There is L extensive coagulative necrosis and some of the necrotic areas show dystrophic calciication. There is sinusoidal and venous invasion and, as described macroscopically, a 30 mm tumour thrombus is present in the renal vein. The P mitotic rate is 4 mitoses per 50 hpt. Occasional atypical mitoses are present. A The tumour is mostly well circumscribed but does show extra-adrenal spread. The tumour abuts the renal vein margin. It is separated from the soft tissue T resection margins by intact tissue planes indicating that all other margins are H 0 L n
