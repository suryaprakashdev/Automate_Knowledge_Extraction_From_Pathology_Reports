QS1117/14 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION An intact left eye. Dimensions: Axial 22mm, Horizontal 22.5mm, Vertical 2lmm Cornea: Horizontal 12mm, Vertical 12mm Description: clear Optic nerve. Length 12mm, Diameter 4mm On trans-illumination, a shadow is seen, measuring 2l x 19mm, located inferomedially. Plane of section: Diagonally Intraocular description: On opening, a non-pigmented choroidal tumour (dome-shaped) is seen. Tumour size LBD 14mm, Height 13mm MICROSCOPY Histologically. the enucleated eye demonstrates a normal anterior segment with an unremarkable cornea, a deep anterior chamber and open angles. The iris leaves are unremarkable. The ciliary muscles are mildly atrophic with mild hyalinisation of the ciliary processes. The lens shows mild cataractous changes. In the posterior segment, arising at the equator, a choroidal melanoma can be.geen. This is dome-shaped with a large accompanying exudative retinal detachment. The retina Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verifled:

Focally, at the apex of the tumour, there is retinal invasion. The tumour is not pigmented and consists of a mixture of cells, both epithelioid and spindle cells, with a dominance of the latter. The melanoma cells are immunoreactive for MelanA, CDi17 and HSp-27 ($core 3). The number of mitoses is high, approx.18/40 high power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is not prominent, and closed loops are not present in the tissue planes evaluated. Occasional  *vascular lakes can be observed; in these tumour cells can be see located within the lumen. The lymphocytic infiltrate within tumour is minimal. Macrophages are scattered throughout the tumour in a mild. There is evidence of scleral invasion in the form of perivascular and intravascular infiltration of the inferomedial vortex vein. The optic nerve is tumour free, and demonstrates mild atrophic changes. The remaining examined vortex veins are free of tumour.. DIAGNOSIS Choroid melanoma of mixed cell type with invasion of the inferomedial vortex vein.

A supplementary report will follow as soon as these investigations' are complete.. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLpa). These investigations were. performed in the The kit P027 from. which examines for gains or losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using.  and the quality assessed using multiplex-pcR prior to the MLPA reaction. The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on assessment. The MLpA reaction was run at least twice on differing occasions, resulting in similar results.. Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified:

In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated: normal chromosome 1, normal chromosome 3, gains in chromosome 6p, loss in chromosome 6q, loss in chromosome 8p and gains in chromosome 8. These molecular data require correlation with the clinical and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment. Reported: Pathologist: Electronlcally Verified: rteria Prior Malignancy Histor
