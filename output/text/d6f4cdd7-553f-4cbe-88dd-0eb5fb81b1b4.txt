CGA-AY-4070 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REVISED REPORT Surgical Pathology Report * Amended * A: Implant, uterine, biopsy. - Nodule of benign smooth muscle consistent with leiomyoma, no tumor seen.. B: Colon, right, hemicolectomy. Tumor Histologic Type: adenocarcinoma. Histologic Grade: poorly differentiated. Depth of Invasion: through muscularis propria into. pericolic adipose tissue. Lymphatic (Small Vessel) Invasion: present. Venous (Large Vessel) Invasion: present Perineural space invasion: present. Margins: Proximal margin: free of tumor. Distal margin: free of tumor.

Circumferential (radial) margin: involved with tumor (block B11) Regional lymph nodes:. Total number with metastasis: 5. Total number examined: 15 AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: at least pT3, cannot exclude pT4 pN2 pMx Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on. information available at the. time of this report, and is subject to change pending. clinical review and. additional information. Additional pathologic findings: The appendix shows fibrous obliteration. The attached portion of small bowel shows no pathologic. abnormality. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis: A frozen section was requested by FSAl: "Uterine implant", biopsy - Benign fibromuscular tissue, no carcinoma seen.. Clinical History: a clinical diagnosis of colon cancer, now undergoes right hemicolectomy. Gross Description:. Received are two appropriately labeled containers.. Container A is additionally labeled "uterine implant." It contains a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm white and red soft tissue fragment; block FsAl, NTR. Container B is additionally labeled "right colon.". Specimen fixation: formalin.

Parts of bowel received: terminal ileum, cecum, proximal. ascending colon, appendix Specimen length: terminal ileum, 11 cm; cecum/colon, 36 cm; appendix, 7 cm Orientation: By anatomic landmarks. Inking: radial margin/blue. Tumor location: cecum. Gross appearance of tumor: The tumor on the mucosal surface is present as an indurated depression with a rolled border. Cross sectioning reveals additional rubbery firm white solid tissue with focal yellow necrosis. This is present in the pericecal adipose tissue/subserosa. The tumor mass here has an infiltrative border with a stellate pattern of extension, including to the radial margin. Tumor dimensions: 6.5 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm Circumferential growth: 40% Gross depth of invasion: Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the. subserosa/pericecal adipose tissue. Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: Tumor is at least very close to the peritoneum. Luminal obstruction: not appreciable Bowel circumference at tumor site: 7 cm Gross distance of tumor from margins: 11 cm to terminal ileum margin, 32 cm to colon margin, radial margin is at least within 1 mm, may be positive. Lymph nodes: per block summary Other remarkable findings: Within the subserosa directly. below the primary tumor. mass, there are multiple foci of yellow/white tumor nodules distending circumferential fibrous tissue..

These may represent lymph nodes completely replaced by tumor,. vascular invasion, and/or exuberant desmoplastic response to subserosal tumor deposits. Tissue submitted for special investigation: Tumor and normal tissue to Tissue procurement. Digital photograph taken:. Block Summary: Inking: radial margin is blue. B1,B2 - terminal ileum margin of resection, en face B3-B5 - colonic margin of resection, en face B6-B8 - full thickness cross section of tumor, from mucosa to positive radial margin B9-Bl1 - full thickness cross section of tumor, from mucosa. to positive radial margin B12 - additional view of subserosal invasion. B13-B15 - additional views of grossly positive radial. margin B16,Bl7 - subserosal tumor deposits with circumferential fibrous tissue B18,B19 - tumor, transition to normal mucosa. B20 - normal colon, distal from tumor B21 - normal terminal ileum, distal from tumor B22 - appendix, cross section of tip and en face sections of base and middle. B23 - two lymph node candidates, one bisected and inked blue B24 - tumor replaced lymph node versus vascular invasion B25 - two lymph node candidates, larger bisected and inked. blue B26 - two lymph node candidates B27 - three lymph node candidates. B28 - two lymph node candidates. B29 - three very small lymph node candidates B30 - two lymph node candidates. B31-B40 - perivascular adipose tissue
