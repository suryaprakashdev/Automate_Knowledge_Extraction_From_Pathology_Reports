The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette  D. Received in formalin labeled "Non-sentinel lymph node - left breast". The specimen consists of a lymph node with surrounding fibroadipose tissue which measures 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in toto in. one cassette. E. Received fresh labeled "Left breast mass -- one stitch short superior -- long lateral". The specimen consists. of a left lumpectomy specimen which measures 9.0 cm from medial to lateral by 6.5 cm from inferior to superior by 3.8 cm from anterior to posterior. There are two sutures; the long designating lateral and the short is designating superior. There is a firm, white, irregularly shaped and poorly defined mass located in the center of the specimen with diffuse extension to the medial and lateral margin. The extensions are.  surrounding by white indurated areas. The tumor appears to be less than 1mm from the superior margin less than 1mm from the posterior margin. The tumor with indurated area appears to be less than 1mm from. the inferior margin. The tumor appears to be less than 1mm from the anterior margin, less than 1mm from the medial margin'and less than 1mm from the lateral margin. The main part of the tumor measures 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm. But with the extensions and indurated areas the tumor measures 9.0 x 6.5 x 3.8 cm. The specimen isinked as follows:. Posterior black Anterior yellow Superior blue Inferior green  Lateral orange Medial red A section of tumor was taken fresh from frozen section for research. Approximately 50% of the section is submitted. Sections are submitted as follows: Cassettes #1&2 Tumor in relation to deep posterior margin
