RIGHT BREAST TISSUE PART A RECEIVED FRESH LABELED LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY STITCH AT SUPERIOR MEDIAL BORDER, IS A LEFT SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN AS ORIENTED BY A SUTURE MEASURING 21 X 20 X 4.5 CM. A SKIN ELLIPSE MEASURES 11.2 X 6.5 CM, WITH A GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE NIPPLE. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED IN BLUE INK, THE DEEP ASPECT IN BLACK INK. IN THE MIDPORTION, THERE IS A 0.9 X 0.7 X 0.9-CM LESION 2.5 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. A PORTION OF THIS IS SUBMITTED PER PROTOCOL, THE MIRROR IMAGE IS SUBMITTED IN A1, AND THE CORRESPONDING DEEP MARGIN IN A2. A SECOND LARGER LESION IS FOUND LATERAL TO THIS MEASURING 2.2 X 1.6 X 1.5 CM.  THIS IS 2 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. THIS DEEP MARGIN IS SUBMITTED IN A3. THESE TWO AREAS ARE 1.5 CM APART. MEDIAL TO ALL OF THESE IS A SMALL SUPERFICIAL LESION, O.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION, 2.5 CM FROM THE FIRST DESCRIBED LESION. THIS LESION IS SUBMITTED IN A6. AS REPRESENTS A SECOND SECTION OF THE LARGEST MOST LATERAL LESION. THE SMALLEST LESION IS 4 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN, WHICH IS SUBMITTED IN A7. THE REMAINING BREAST TISSUE CONSISTS OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE WITH FINE FIBROUS BANDS. ADDITIONAL SECTIONS OF THE BREAST TISSUE ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS:  A8--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, A9--UPPER INNER QUADRANT, A1O--LOWER INNER QUADRANT, A11--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT, A12--NIPPLE. THE LARGEST LESION IS SUPERIOR TO THE NIPPLE, AND
