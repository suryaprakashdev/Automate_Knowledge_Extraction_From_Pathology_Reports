FOR OFFICIAL USR ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORTS Patient:. Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): (ESTROGEN RECEPTOR, PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR, AND HER-2 STUDIES WERE PERFORMED ON AN EARLIER BIOPSY AT SCOTTSDALE PATHOLOGY CONSULTANTS, ACCESSION -PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pT2NO(i-)MX -ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC CHANGES: COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE. CYSTIC CHANGE, APOCRINE METAPLASIA, B. RIGHT BREAST TISSUE FROM INFERIOR FLAP, EXCISION: -NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC CHANGE. C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, BIOPSY: -NO METASTATIC DEPOSIT IDENTIFIED IN ONE EXAMINED LYMPH NODE (MULTIPLE SLIDES STAINED WITH HEMATOXYLIN&EOSIN AND WITH IMMUNOSTAIN FOR CYTOKERATIN) D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE RIGHT AXILLA #2, BIOPSY: -NO METASTATIC DEPOSIT IDENTIFIED IN ONE EXAMINED LYMPH NODE (MULTIPLE SLIDES STAINED WITH HEMATOXYLIN&EOSIN AND WITH IMMUNOSTAIN FOR CYTOKERATIN) COMMENT : The smaller tumor in the upper inner quadrant is present at the margin and involves an inked surgical margin over a cut arc of 4 to 5 mm. Because. the greatest extent of the tumor cannot be assessed, this tumor might otherwise be classified pTx. The cenral mass appears to be larger and is. completely excised. Its greatest dimension of 2.5 cm is the basis of the. pathologic T stage of pT2. AMENDMENT COMMENT The report is amended to add evaluation of markers (ER, PR, Her2) performed on the upper inner quadrant tumor, sections of block A2. studies reported for the central tumor are from the report of a biopsy designated "12:0o" at another institution.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 NTER SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: breast cancer year old female GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name designated "RIGHT MASTECTOMY sPECIMEN" is a 278 gram right mastectomy oriented with short stitch superior, long lateral and double deep. The specimen measures 16 cm medial to lateral, 14 cm superior to inferior and 3 cm anterior to posterior. The lightly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 10 x 3 cm and displays a 1.7 cm everted nipple free of discharge. No scars are noted. The deep margin is inked black and the superficial surface of the upper inner quadrant is inked blue. Serially sectioned to reveal a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm firm pink white mass abutting the superficial margin of the UIQ (1:oo). The cut surface shows focal congestion consistent with a previous biopsy. The mass comes to within 2.0 cm of the deep margin. Located approximately 1.0 cm lateral to this mass is a very poorly defined mass of similar appearance which measures 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm and involves the upper mid and central portions of the breast. The central mass comes to within 1.0 cm of the deep margin. The remainder of the specimen is composed of moderately dense markedly nodular fibrous tissue. The adipose tissue compromises 20% of the specimen is unremarkable. No lymph nodes are identified. Summary of sections: Al: one piece, skin A2-A4: one piece in each, upper inner quadrant mass anterior margin A5: one piece, central mass deep margin. A6: one piece, central mass A7: upper outer quadrant A8: lower outer quadrant A9: lower inner quadrant A10: upper inner quadrant All: one piece, nipple A12-A13: one piece each, representative mass. 13CF Matched sections of A1-A2 and A6-A10 are submitted in protocol. for CBCP B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name designated "BREAST TISSUE FROM INFERIOR FLAP" are multiple pieces of yellow tan lobulated adipose tissue measuring 4.7 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm in. aggregate dimension. Sectioning reveals grossly unremarkable fibroadipose tissue throughout. Representative sections submitted. Summary of sections: B1-B4: one piece in each, 4C4. C.
