CGA-A6-2683 SPECIMEN A. Right colon. B.  Liver biopsy CLINICAL NOTES PRE-op DiagnosIs: Ascending colon cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh for tissue procurement, labeled "right. colon", is a previously unopened, 12 cm segment of proximal right colon with attached 6 cm of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to scabrous tan-pink serosa with a moderate amount of attached mesocolon and mesentery. An unremarkable 5.7 cm appendix averaging 0.65 cm in diameter is present. The proximal and distal margins measure 7.5 and 6 cm in circumference respectively. On opening, there is a circumferential, 8.5 x 6.5 cm tumor mass extending from the ileocecal valve into the colonic segment. The tumor is present within 7 cm of the distal margin. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 1.2 cm, grossly extending into the muscularis to within 0.4 cm of the inked free radial serosal surface (see blue blocks 2-4). The uninvolved ileal and colonic mucosa is. unremarkable, glistening tan-pink-red with irregular folds and the. walls average 0.5 cm in thickness. A portion of tumor and a. portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. Several soft to slightly rubbery pale tan tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension are. recovered from the attached mesocolon and mesentery. Representative sections are submitted in 13 blocks as labeled. Rs-13. BLOck suMmARy: 1 - Proximal and distal margin; 2-4 - tumor to inked free radial serosal surface; 5 - central tumor; 6 - tumor at IcD; 7  random ileum and colon; 8 - appendix; 9, 10 - eight whole lymph nodes per cassette; 11 - seven whole lymph nodes; 12, 13 - one bisected lymph node per cassette.

GROSS DESCRIPTION B. Received in formalin, labeled "liver biopsy", is a core biopsy of white tissue that measures 2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. in. dimension. The tissue is entirely submitted for permanent section. in cassette labeled B. AS-1 MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  This right hemicolectomy specimen has an infiltrating adenocarcinoma beginning at the ileocecal valve and extending into the colon. Please see the template below: Histologic type: Infiltrating adenocarcinoma. Histologic grade: Moderately to poorly differentiated. Primary tumor (pT): Tumor extends to the visceral peritoneum, pT4. Proximal margin: Negative for tumor. Distal margin: Negative for tumor. Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor. Distance of tumor from closest margin: The tumor is 7 cm. from the distal margin. Vascular invasion: Not detected. Regional lymph nodes (pN): All 25 regional lymph nodes are negative for metastatic disease, 0/25, pN0. Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Negative. Distant metastasis (pM): As per part B, metastatic disease is present in the liver, pM1. Other findings: Appendix, no significant pathology. B. This core of tissue is composed entirely of metastatic,. moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with colonic origin. There is a markedly desmoplastic stroma. No residual hepatic parenchyma is present.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 5, 4 DIAGNOSIS A. Right colon, right hemicolectomy - Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right colon, extending deeply into pericolonic fat and to the inked serosal peritoneal surface. All other margins and all 25 regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor. Appendix and portion of terminal ileum, no significant pathology. B. Liver, core biopsy - Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with metastasis from colonic primary.
