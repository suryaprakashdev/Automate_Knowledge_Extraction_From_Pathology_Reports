7. Soft tissue margin or serosa: Negative for tumor. 8. Lymph nodes: Negative for tumor (0/16). 9. pTNM: pT4a,N0,MX Effective January 1, 2010 this Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging system for Bladder of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC). Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the Resident/Fellow, [], MD, PhD Electronically Signed Out by [] MD Clinical History: Patient is a  year-old female clinical history of bladder cancer who undergoes cystectomy, ileo conduit N. retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.. Specimens Received: A: Bladder B: Right pelvic lymph nodes C: Left pelvic lymph nodes D: Left distal uretheral margin E: Right distal ureter Gross Description: The specimens are received in five containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "bladder". Received fresh and place in formalin is a 145.08 g cystectomy specimen with overall. measurements of 12.5 x 11.0 x 3.7 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 3 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter, and the left measures 2.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter, and both demonstrate intact patent lumens. The serosal surface shows yellow, lobulated fibroadipose tissue with focal cautery artifact. There is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm matted area on left posterior bladder held together by a suture which is removed to reveal a 1.6 x 0.9 cm defect and a 4.0 x 3.5 cm area of peritoneal discoloration on the right side adjacent to the dome. There is a 7.4 x 7.0 cm portion of tan-pink vaginal mucosa fixed on the posterior aspect of the bladder. The urethral margin is inked black, and the bladder is inked blue on the right half and black on the left half. The bladder measures 6.0 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is opened anteriorly to reveal a 2.5 x 1.7 cm red-tan,  hemorrhagic, friable, ulceration located in posterior wall within an ill-defined

4.1 x 3 cm area of induration. On cut section, the mass is white-tan, indurated, and extends through the muscularis propria and pericystic adipose tissue and abuts the deep surgical margin (i.e. 2.5 cm of 2.6 cm of the total thickness of the specimen). Inferiorly, the induration also appears to abut the vaginal wall. The surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled, congested, pink-tan with a uniform 0.5-0.9 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe patent.. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. A1: Left ureter A2: Right ureter A3: Urethral margin A4: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall A5: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall. A6: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome. A7-A10: Bladder mass/Ulceration A11-A13: Bladder mass abutting the vaginal wall A14 Fallopian tube A15-A16 Ovary B. The second container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.0 x 4.5 x 0.9 cm aggregate of soft, rubbery, yellow-tan tissue fragments that are dissected for approximately 10 lymph node candidates are submitted as follows B1: Two lymph node candidates B2: One lymph node candidates, bisected B3 B4: One lymph node candidates, bisected, one half in each cassette B5: Five lymph node candidates B6: One lymph node candidates, bisected C. The third container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 1.1 cm aggregate of soft, rubbery, yellow-tan tissue fragments that are dissected for approximately 9 lymph node candidates are submitted as follows. C1: Five lymph node candidates C2: One lymph node candidates, bisected C3: One lymph node candidates C4: One lymph node candidates, bisected. C5-C6: One lymph node candidates, bisected, one half in each cassette D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "left distal ureteral margin stitch on margin side ". Received in formalin is a 2.3 cm in length by 0.9 cm in external diameter segment of ureter. There is a stitch on the non-margin side. The serosal surface of the margin side is inked black. The margin side of the ureter and a representative section are submitted in cassette D1.

E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, "right distal ureter, stitch on margin side". Received in formalin is a 2.9 cm in length by 0.5 cm in external diameter segment of ureter. The non-margin side is indicated with a suture. The margin side is inked black and is submitted with a representative section of the ureter in cassette E1.
