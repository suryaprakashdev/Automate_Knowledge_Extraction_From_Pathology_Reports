Electronically Signed out by . Ancillary Testing Immunohistochemical stains (AMACR, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, CD117, vimentin) performed with. appropriate positive and negative controls on blocks A3 and A5 support the diagnosis. Immunohistochemical stain (RcC antigen) performed with appropriate positive and negative control on. block A5 supports the diagnosis. Special stain (Hale's colloidal iron) performed with appropriate. control on block A5 supports the diagnosis..

FSB1: DEEP MARGIN, INK IS MARGIN: Negative. Comment: This frozen section diagnosis/result was communicated to and acknowledged by Dr..  have performed the intraoperative consultation and issued the above  diagnosis.e Gross Description  Specimen A is received fresh tor frozen section analysis labeled "right partial nephrectomy ink. 4. equals margin." The specimen consists of a 5.5 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm partial nephrectomy. The surgical margin resection is marked with black ink. Serial sectioning reveals a soft, red-brown mass (4.5 x 4.5. x 3.0 cm) grossty abutting the surgical margin resection. The overlying capsule is intact and marked. with blue ink. The remainder of the renal parenchyma is red-brown and grossly unremarkable.. Representative frozen sections taken and submitted as FSA1. Representative section of the tumor submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Permanent representative sections are submitted as: A2: Mirror image of tumor submitted to the Tissue Bank. A3: Tumar shown in its relationship to overtying capsule. A4-A7: Representative sections of tumor showing its relationship to adjacent tissue. AB: Grossty unremarkable renal parenchyma. B. Specimen B is received fresh for frozen section analysis iabeled "deep margin, ink is margin.". The specimen consists of 1.5 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm saft, tan-pink, irregular fragment of renal parenchyma,. which is marked with ink on the surgical margin resection.* The specimen is serially resectioned and. entirely submitted for frozen section as FS81.
