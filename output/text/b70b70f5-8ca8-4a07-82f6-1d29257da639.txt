SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #4 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and 'sentinel lymph node #4 right axilla' is a tan- pink lymph node 1.8 x 0.5 x 0.3cm. The specimen is sectioned and a touch prep is taken.. Toto E1. F. RIGHT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast" is a 222g, 18.5 x 16 x 2.3cm oriented (stitch in axilla) simple mastectomy with attached 4.3 x 2cm tan-pink skin ellipse. The skin surface is grossly unremarkable. Ink code: anterior-superior: blue, anterior-inferior: orange, areola- green, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 15 slices, revealing a 2 x 1.8 x 1.6cm tan-pink, firm, well-circumscribed mass, 0.2cm from the deep margin and 2.4cm from the skin surface in the LOQ-LC of slices 6-7. A 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2cm firm, nodular area is identified, 3.2cm from the deep margin and 1.2cm from the anterior-inferior margin of the LC of slices 10-11. The small nodule is 2.2cm inferior to the areolar stitch. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted: F1: LOQ slice 5 F2-F3: UOQ slice 6 F4: LOQ with skin slice 6 F5-F6: mass with deep margin LOQ slice 6 F7: UOQ slice 7 F8-F9: mass with deep margin LOQ slice 7 F10: UOQ slice 8 F11: LOQ slice 8 F12: UOQ slice 9 F13: nodule LC slice 10

LEFT BREAST SKIN Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and 'left breast skin' are two unoriented tan- pink fragments of unremarkable skin 3.2 x 1.8 x 0.4cm and 6.5 x 3 x 0.5cm.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient with breast cancer at inferior mammary crease; 2nd area of enhancement in lower breast by MRI (low suspicion). PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: FSA1-FSA2: Subareolar tissue right breast- Normal breast tissue. No tumor seen. Diagnosis called to Dr. at by Dr.. TPB1-TPB2-TPC-TPD-TPE: SLN #1-2-3-4 right axilla: Negative for tumor. Diagnosis called to Dr. at by Dr.. F. Right breast- Gross examination: 2cm mass, 0.2cm from deep margin. Fibrotic area at subareolar region. No definite mass. Diagnosis called to Dr. at. by Dr.. ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: F9 ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 PR: Negative Allred Score:  0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from O to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed usinn the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. interpretauon di tne ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.
