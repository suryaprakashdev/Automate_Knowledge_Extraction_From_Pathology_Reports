I agree with the G diagnosis of adrenal cortical carcinoma diagnosed by The Y tumour is composed of variably pleomorphic cells, which are arrangea in ditfuse sheets, nests and cords. The cells have enlarged hyperchromatic nucleai. I C There are scattered cells with markedly atypical nuclei, including 3 multi-nucleated forms. Occasional mitoses are present (up to 3/50 hpf). Atypical mitoses are not identified. The cells have variable amounts of eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. Cell borders are indistinct. There is a prominent myxoid stroma throughout the tumour. There are also prominent vessels. There is no capsular or venous space invasion, however sinusoida! invasion is seen in one area.. Corticas Immunohistochemistry was performed. The tumour cells are positive with A calretinin and melin A.The tumour demonstrates four of the nine Weiss C 74. N criteria, comprising high nuclear grade, loss of clear cells, diffuse architecture and sinusoidal invasion. In view of this, and the large size of A the tumour, it is best regarded as an adrenal cortical carcinoma. 83701 T SUMMARY: 0 Right adrenal gland - Adrenal cortical carcinoma.

AUUHONAL REPORT COPIES SENT TO Requested: HISTOPATHOLOGY THIS TOP SECTION MAY bE DETACHED PRIOR TO FILiNG Sex: HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT MACROSCOPIC: "Right adrenal gland". The specimen consists of a previously opened,. encapsulated oval tumour 148g and 85x55x70mm. The capsule is shiny and grey with a small amount of adnerent adrenal gland and fat but the vast majority of  the specimen is composed of tumour which has a variegated yellow to tan cut surface with prominent areas ot haemorrhage. Representative sections.. (Blocks A to L, wlth B including a tiny amount of attached adrenal gland) CAC4. MICROSCOPIC: The adrenal cortex is replaced by a tumour composed of loosely cohesive cells with plentiful eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclel. There Is considerable  cellular pleomorphism with'trequent large hyperchromatic nuclel. The cells are arranged in cords and sheets and in many places are separated by pools of mucinous material. In the more pleomorphlc areas, there are up to three mitoses 13 per ten high power fields. Many of the cells contain PAS positive globules. There is no evidence of capsular or vascular invasion. The tumour cells fail to stain tor S100 protein, chromogranin A or calretinin. The appearance Is in keeping with ah adrenocortical carcinoma..
