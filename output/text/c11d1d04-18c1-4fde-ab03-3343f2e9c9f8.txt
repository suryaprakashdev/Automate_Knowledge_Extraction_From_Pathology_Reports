Clinical Diagnosis & History: History of right colon cancer and diverticulitis.  Here for total abdominal colectomy. Specimens Submitted: 1: sp: Terminal ileum and colon; total abdominal colectomy DIAGNOSIS: 1. SP: Terminal ileum and colon; total abdominal colectomy: Tumor Type: Mucinous adenocarcinoma with a minor component that is of conventional (gland-forming) type Histologic Grade:  Moderately to poorly differentiated Tumor Location: Ascending colon Tumor Size: Length is 3.0 cm Width is 2.6 cm Maximal thickness is 0.9 cm Tumor Budding: Extensive Increased Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes: Present Precursor Lesions: Tubulovillous adenoma Deepest Tumor Invasion: Subserosal adipose tissue and/or mesenteric fat Gross Tumor Perforation: Not identified Lymphovascular Invasion: Identified Large Venous Invasion: Suspected Perineural Invasion:. Identified Surgical Margins: Free of tumor Polyps/Mucosa Dysplasia (away from the carcinoma): ** Continued on next page **

Diverticulosis of left colon Appendix: Unremarkable Lymph Nodes: Number with metastasis: 1 Total number examined: 46 Tumor deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue:. Not Identified Tumor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition): pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues) Lymph Node Stage (AJcc 7th Edition) :  N1 (Metastasis in 1-3 regional lymph nodes) I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. 1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "total abdominal colectomy" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and colon. The terminal ileum measures 11.0 cm in length and 4.2 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin.. The remaining colon measures. 96.0 cm in length with a circumference of 6.0 cm at the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measures 8.0 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 1.3 cm in thickness.. The specimen is opened to reveal a mass lesion measuring 3.0 cm in length and 2.6 cm in width. The mass is located in the ascending colon, 16.1 cm from the proximal margin and 89.0 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades into the muscularis propria. The depth of invasion is 0.9 cm grossly. The are two polyps measuring 0.2 and 0.7 cm in the transverse colon.. Diverticula and muscle wall thickening are present in the distal 14.0 cm of the colon. The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable. The attached. adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for Tps.. Summary of sections: p - proximal margin shave ** Continued on next page **

CLINICAL CORRELATION IS SUGGESTED. NOTE: STAINS PERFORMED ON A SEPARATE ADENOMA  SHOW A NORMAL STAINING PATTERN FOR ALL 4 PROTEINS (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 AND PMS2). Some of the immunohistochemistry and Ish tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is ** Continued on next page **
