Please see diagnosis and comment below. PROCEDURE:APDX 1. Right adrenal gland, resection: Adrenocortical carcinoma, low-grade by mitotic activity. Margins negative. Please see previous report and coMMENT below. COMMENT : This low-grade adrenocortical carcinoma shows a variety of histologic  patterns. A p53 immunostain shows a focal area with nuclear pleomorphism to be. positive for nuclear immunoreactivity within this region, raising the. possibility of an early and focal p53 mutation. The Ki-67 immunostain shows an increased Mi8-1 labeting index within this p53-pasitive region. Throughout the neoplasm, the beta-catenin stain shows a membranous immunoreactive pattern, consistent with the absence of a WNT pathway activation. The p53 and MIB-1. results together raise the possibility that this low-grade adrenocortical carcinoma has developed a focal high-grade component. However, the clinical significance of a focal high-grade component is unknown. - -hg signing statf pathologist, have exaninea ana interpreted the slides from this case.

Concern for adrenal cortical carcinoma. Operative Procedure: Right adrenalectomy, possible. hepatic cyst removal.. PROCEDURE:SPGD 1. #Right adrenal gland, 2 short stitch = superior, 1 long = lateral, 2 long = posterior, concern for Acc" Received in formalin is a 160 gram, 8.7 cm superior to inferior x 7.7 cm medial to lateral x 4.9 cm anterior to posterior. adrenalectomy specimen that contains an 8.5 x 5.2 x 4.8 cm tumor and a small anount of attached adipose tissue. The tumor appears to arise from the adrenal cortex and has fleshy, tan cut surfaces with bright orange foci. A 4.5 x 4.2 x. 3.9 cm area of the tumor is soft and yellow-white, probably necrotic. The tumor is well-circumscribed and closely approaches all margins but there is. freely mobile capsule at all margins. Single short stitch superior. Single long stitch is lateral. Double long stitch is posterior. Anterior inked yellow, posterior inked black, superior blue, inferior green, medial red, lateral orange. Gross photographs taken. 1A. Tumor to superior margin. 18. Tumor to inferior margin. 1C. Temor to anterior margin. 10. Tumor to posterior margin. 1E. Tumor to lateral margin. 1F-H. Tumor to medial margin with adrenal gland. 1I-J. Additional representative sections of tumor. 2. "Right liver cyst wall" Received in formalin is a 7.4 x 2.7 x 0.4 cm portion of tissue with a pink-tan, smooth surface on one side and a pink-red ragged surface on the other side. No masses or lesions are identified. Two representative sections submitted in cassette 2A. PROCEDURE: SPMI ADRENOCORTICAL CARCINOMA V4
