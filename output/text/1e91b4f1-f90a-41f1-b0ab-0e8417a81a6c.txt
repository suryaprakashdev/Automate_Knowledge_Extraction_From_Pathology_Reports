RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SENTINEL NODES RIGHT AXILLA  Received fresh are four tan pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.4cm to 2cm. Four touch preps are taken. A1: 1 lymph node A2: 1 lymph node A3: 1 lymph node A4: 1 lymph node B. RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "WLE right breast needle localization" is a previously  inked oriented 204g, 12.5 x 10 x 7.5cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-blue, inferior-orange, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 11 slices revealing 4 masses:.  Mass #1- 0.4cm, 1.3cm from the anterior margin in slice 5  Mass #2- 0.3cm, 1.5cm from mass #1 and 2.5cm from anterior margin in slice 5 Mass #3- 3.5 x 2.6 x 2cm, 0.5cm from the anterior and posterior margins in slice 6-9. Mass #4- 1cm, 2cm from mass #3 and 2cm from the deep margin in slice 6 A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted: B1: lateral margin slice 1 B2: slice 2 B3: biopsy site slice 2 B4: slice 2 B5-B9: slice 4  B10: mass #1 with anterior margin slice 5 B11: superior margin slice 5. B12: area in between mass #1 and mass #2 slice 5 B13: slice 5 B14: slice 5 B15: inferior margin slice 5. B16: deep margin slice 5 B17-B19: mass #3 slice 6 B20: mass #4 slice 6 B21: deep margin slice 6 B22-B25: mass #3 slice 7 B26-B27: mass #3 slice 8 B28-B30: mass #3 with clip ID in B28 slice 9 B31-B32: slice 10 B33-B34: medial margin slice 11 DIAGNOSIS: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODES, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY:E - ONE OF FOUR LYMPH NODES WITH ISOLATED TUMOR CELLS (O/4) NOTE: Cytokeratin AE1/3 stains were performed on A1 and A4 and is negative in A1 and positive in A4, highlighting scattered tumor cells. On the cytokeratin AE1/3 stain, ~ 100 cytokeratin positive cells are seen, a feature that would be consistent with isolated tumor cells versus a micrometastasis. The touch prep of A4 was reviewed and tumor cells were not seen. B. BREAST, RIGHT, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2. - TUmOR MEASURES AT LEAST 3.5 CM. - TUMOR IS PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR MARGIN.E - LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS) AND COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE.I - ONE  INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1). - SKELETAL MUSCLE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

NOTE: Grossly, several iesions were noted that microscopically correspond to invasive carcinoma. The size of the. tumor is difficult to determine. While the single largest focus of tumor grossly is 3.5 cm, microscopically, invasive carcinoma is present in 6 of 11 slices of a 12.5 cm specimen and therefore may span ~ 6 cm. Clinical-radiologic correlation is recommended. A 0.5cm intramammary lymph node was also identified.. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST Specimen Type: Excision Needle Localization.
