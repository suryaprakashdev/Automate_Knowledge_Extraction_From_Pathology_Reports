The specimen is serially sectioned and a touch prep is taken. Toto C1. D. LEFT BREAST AND LOWER AXILLA-Stitch in axilia  Received fresh is an oriented 1314g, 30 x 28 x 6cm mastectomy with 15 x 6cm tan pink skin ellipse, 1.2 cm centrally Iocated, partially raised nipple and 1.5 cm areolar rim. The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior/Superior-Blue, Anterior/Inferior-Orange, Posterior-Black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 12 slices, slice 1 being most medial, slice 12 being most lateral. The nipple is located in slice 7. The cut surfaces reveal a gray white ill defined firm mass 3.5 x 2.8 x 2cm, 1.8cm from the deep margin located in slices 4, 5, 6 and 7. The area  surrounding the mass is remarkable for fibrosis and possible fat necrosis. The lower axillary tail is 6 x 5 x 3cm. Dissection reveals 4 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5cm to 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.5cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1: nipple slice 7 D2: base of nipple slice 7. D3: UIQ area next to mass slice 3 D4-D5: mass bisected UIQ slice 4 D6: anterior margin UIQ slice 4 D7: deep margin UIQ slice 4 D8: mass UIQ slice 5 D9: deep margin UIQ slice 5 D10: skin slice 5 D11-D12: mass UIQ slice 6 D13: deep margin UIQ slice 6 D14: LIQ slice 6 D15-D16: mass bisected UC slice 7 D17: deep margin UC slice 7 D18: LC with inferior margin slice 7 D19: UOQ next to mass slice 8 D20: LOQ slice 8 D21: 2 lymph nodes D22: 2 lymph nodes D23-D26: lower axillary tissue DIAGNOSIS: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, LEFT BREAST, BIOPSY: - TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/2). B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, LEFT BREAST, BIOPSY: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (O/1). C.

The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in the medica!  literature, provided package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance and. assay validation within the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory. The use of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (AsR). These tests were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the Department of Pathology Laboratory. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.. Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive and negative controls. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: D11 ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 PR: Positive Allred Score: 4 = Proportion Score 2 + intensity Score 2 COMMENT:  The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining. 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate. intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than. or equal to 2.  METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistrv was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by Dako , following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunonistocnemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,  information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Resuits: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinicai Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ  hybridization (FiSH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17 wtn 4 to 5 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 3 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used D11 Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.29  This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic  mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. it is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free  and overall survival in stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu.  gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test  FDA APPROVED REAGENT  PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the
