Sentinel lymph node #1, excision: No evidence of metastasis in 3 lymph nodes (0/3). B. Sentinel lymph node #2, excision: No evidence of metastasis in 3 lymph nodes (0/3). C. Right breast, mastectomy:. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 3, 4.3 cm greatest dimension, surgical margins negative but close (0.4 cm, deep). Microscopic Description:. Microscopic examination performed. A. B. sections of sentinel lymph nodes 1 and 2 demonstrate no evidence in 3 lymph nodes in each specimen. The lymph nodes were examined by multilevel sectioning with H&E staining as well as by histochemistry for pankeratin. C. Invasive Carcinoma: present Histologic type:  infiltrating ductal cancer Histologic grade: Overall grade: 3 Architectural score:. Nuclear score: 3 Mitotic score: Greatest dimension (pT): 4.3 cm, pT2 Specimen margins:  negative, 0.4 cm to deep margin Vessel invasion: not identified Calcification:  not identified Ductal carcinoma in situ: not identified )cs-0~3 Specimen Sentinel node #1 C arcinoma, nfAtnuHng cuct, noS B.

 Container B. is labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "palpable nodule right axilla". Per Dr. this should be. regarded as such libido for to. The specimen container holds 3 separate lymph nodes. Each lymph node is bisected and submitted in one block, C. Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin at labeled "right mastectomy" is a 27.0 cm (superior to inferior) by 26.0 cm (medial to lateral) by 6.5 cm (anterior to posterior) diffusely cauterized soft, lobulated tan-white-gold portion of fibroadipose tissue in keeping with breast. A 23.5 x 10.0 cm wrinkled brown skin ellipse with a central, 1.1 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm nipple is present along the anterior aspect.  A palpable nodular mass corresponds to the lower inner quadrant and the anteroinferior surface is inked orange. The intact deep margin is inked blue and the specimen is sectioned. The after mentioned palpable mass is well-circumscribed glistening tan-white and rubbery, measuring 4.3 cm (medial to lateral) by 3.8 cm (anterior to posterior) by 3.1 cm (superior to inferior).  The tumor extends to within 0.4 cm of the inked deep margin and 1 cm of the. anteroinferior inked surface.  Several cylindrical firm tan-white structures are associated with the lesion. A portion of the lesion and a portion of normal parenchyma are submitted for tissue procurement as requested.  The remaining soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue with a scant amount of interspersed delicate tan-white fibrous tissue.. No additional mass lesion or abnormality is identified grossly. Rs 12 Summary: 1 through 3 - tumor to inked deep margin, 4 and 5 - tumor to inked anteroinferior margin, 6 - tumor to normal parenchyma, 7 - random. quadrant, 10  - lower outer quadrant, 11 - junction of the 4 quadrants, 12 - nipple
