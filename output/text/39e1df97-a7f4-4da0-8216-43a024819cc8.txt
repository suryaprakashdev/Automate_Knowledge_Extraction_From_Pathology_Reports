The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in the medical literature, provided package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance and assay validation within the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory of the The use of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (ASR). These tests were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the t. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food ana Drug Administration. qy "ne FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive and negative controls. DIAGNOSIS: A.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. 1mmunohistochemistry was performed usina the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR following the manufacturer s instructions.

TSS ID SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: Interpretation:  NEGATIVE Intensity: 1+ % Tumor Staining: 5% Fish Ordered: No METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analvsis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides proviaeu vy ue inanufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in- house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published resuits in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. CLINICAL HISTORY: Lesion on core biopsy, right breast; Left breast carcinoma.
