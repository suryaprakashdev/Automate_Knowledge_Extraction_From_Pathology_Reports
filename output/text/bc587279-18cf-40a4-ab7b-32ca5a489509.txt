Operative Procedure/tissue Submitted: Left adrenal mass excision. PROCEDURE: SPGD 1. "Liver capsule, rule out metastatic adrenal cancer." A 0.5 cm, red-brown tissue fragment with a 0.1 cm white nodule. Frozen section control.. 2. "Left adrenal gland with retroperitoneal fat, two short stitches equals Superior, one long stitch equals lateral, two long stitch equals posterior". Received fresh for tissue procurement in a large container is a 585 gram (untrimmed weight), 17.2 x 12.5 x 5.4 cm mass with attached fat oriented as above. The mass itself measures 8.5 x 8.5 x 6.2 cm and grossly appears well encapsulated. Inked as per standard inking template. Untrimmed weight is 370 grams. Attached to the mass is a 5.5 x 1.0 cm adrenal gland. The cut surfaces Show yellow soft focally hemorrhagic cut surfaces. The normal adrenal gland IeD-6-3 has an orange cortex and a brown medulla. The mass grossly appears to arise 2A and B. Tumor to adrenal gland to include anterior and medial margins. 113 2c. Tumor to include tateral margin. 2D. Tumor to include superior margin. 2E.

 PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS INQUIRY PAGE #: 2 REPORT OATE: 4 SEX:M PAT TYPE: ADM DATE: BIRTHDATE: OPER DATE: Tumor size: 8.5 x 8.5 x 6.2 cm Tumor Weight: 370 grams Capsular Invasion: Present Vascular Invasion: Absent Surgical Margins:!. Negative Necrosis: Present, focal (5%) Mitotic Rate: 5/50 hpf Grade: Low grade Lymph nodes status:. N/A Extra-adrenal extension: No Stage: T2 Nx Mx Immunohistochemistry Results: See coMmenT. PROCEDURE: SPDX 1. Liver capsule, biopsy: Negative for neoplasm. 2. Left adrenal gland, resection: low grade adrenocortical carcinoma (8.5 cm), confined to the adrenal. Surgical margins negative. See TEMPlAte above and COMMENT bel ow. 3. Left perirenal fat, excision: Benign fibroadipose tissue.. COMMENT This carcinoma appears to be arising from a pre-existing adrenocortical. adenoma, present on the periphery. The tumor cells show patchy positive. staining for synaptophysin, melan-A, and inhibin; rare positive staining for cytokeratin, and negative staining for chromogranin and s-100. MI8-1 shows a proliferative index of approximately 20%. These results support a diagnosis of low grade adrenocortical carcinoma.
