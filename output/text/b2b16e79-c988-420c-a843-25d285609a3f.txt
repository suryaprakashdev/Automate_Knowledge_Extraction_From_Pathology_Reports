DIAGNOSIS (A) UTERUS AND CERVIX: Proliferative endometrium with adenomyosis.. Myometrial leiomyomata. Chronic cervicitis. (B) RIGHT KIDNEY: RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CHROMOPHOBE TYPE, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, (7.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION). TUMOR IS LIMITED TO KIDNEY. Margins of resection are free of tumor.. No renal vein invasion is present.. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) UTERUS AND CERVIX - A uterus (11.5 cm superior - inferior x 5.5 cm cornu-cornu x 5.7 cm anterior-posterior). There are twelve tan whorled nodules (ranging from 5.0 x 3. 0 x 3.0 cm to 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm) in the myometrium. The endometrium and myometrium is otherwise unremarkable (endometrium thickness 0.2 cm, myometrial thickness 2.3 cm). The cervix is unremarkable. SECTION CODE: A1, anterior cervix; A2, posterior cervix; A3, anterior lower uterine segment; A4, anterior endomyometrium; A5, posterior endomyometrium; A6-A8, three intramural nodules, anterior myometrium in each; A9, two intramural nodules in posterior myometrium; A10, one largest intramural nodule, representative sections. (B) RIGHT KIDNEY - Received is a radical nephrectomy specimen (12 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm) including the right kidney (11.0 x 5.0 x 5.5 cm), a segment of the renal artery, the renal vein, and ureter (9.0 cm in length x 0.6 cm in average diameter). No adrenal gland is identified. There is a 7.0 x 5.5 x 6.0 cm well-circumscribed tumor in the upper pole of the kidney. The tumor is tan-pink, soft and almost entirely necrotic. There are foci of hemorrhage both peripherally and centrally. The tumor does not invade the perinephric adipose tissue, renal sinus or renal vein. The tumor does not extend to Gerota's fascia. The adjacent renal parenchyma is tan-brown and otherwise unremarkable. The pelvicaliceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. No lymph nodes are identified in the hilum. Portions of the tumor have been submitted for possible electron microscopy. INK CODE: Blue - Gerota's fascia. SECTION CODE: B1, ureter, renal artery and renal vein margins; B2, B3, representative sections of tumor; B4, B5, representative sections of tumor with perinephric adipose tissue; B6, B7, representative sections of tumor with renal sinus and renal pelvis; B8, representative sections of uninvolved kidney. CLINICAL HISTORY Symptomatic fibroids and right renal mass.. SNOMED CODES
