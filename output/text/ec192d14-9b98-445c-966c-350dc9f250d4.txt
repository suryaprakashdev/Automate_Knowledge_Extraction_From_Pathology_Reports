UUID: 554C324B-C9C3-4936-B5E4-B3541A54364D0 Department of Pathology TCGA-P4-A5E6-01A-PR Redacted Tissue Source Site (TSS) #: Patholgy Accession No: Patient ID: Normal Sample ID: Pathology Report t<D-o-3 COMMENT rencd eel 8QsJ3 This addendum report is issued to comment on the type of papillary renal cell carcinoma, as it was not mentioned in the original report. There is no other change in diagnosis.. DKidnty NOS Site After review of the H&E slides, this tumor is designated as type 2 papillary renal cell. Cb4 carcinoma. nS 1J1c/13 DIAGNOSIS (A) LEfT 12Th RiB: Segment of rib, for gross inspection only. (B) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL: PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3.S TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. TUMOR MEASURES 6.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION. Vascular ureteral and soft tissue margins of resection free of tumor. Multiple renal cortical adenomas (0.3 cm in maximum dimension).  Multiple renal cortical (simple) cysts (5.0 cm in maximum dimension). Adrenal cortical hyperplasia. (C) HILAR LYMPH NODES: METASTATIC PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IN ONE OF THREE LYMPH NODES. (SEE COMMENT) COMMENT The metastatic focus in one lymph node consists of a few clusters of neoplastic cells in the subcapsular sinus and measures less than 0.1 cm in maximum dimension. Multiple additional deeper sections were examined. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT 12TH RIB, GROSS ONLY - A tan-pink linear fragment of bone (6.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm). The specimen is submitted as gross only.. (B) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL - A left radical nephrectomy (24.0 x 10.0 x 7.0 cm) consisting of a kidney (14.0 x 0.5 x 7.0 x 6.5 cm) and adrenal. gland (8.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm). Within the mid portion of the kidney is a well circumscribed soft friable mass (6.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm). The tumor pushes against the perirenal adipose tissue but does not appear to invade it, the tumor also pushes against the renal pelvis but does not appear to invade. The. tumor does not appear to invade the renal vein..  The uninvolved kidney parenchyma is remarkable for several cysts ranging size from 0.5 to 5.0 cm in greatest diameter. They are mainly. Iocated in the cortex. Also present are approximately seven yellow nodules, all of which measure (<0.3 cm in greatest dimension). The adrenal gland is remarkable for a large nodule and diffuse enlargement.. A portion of tumor and kidney is submitted to the tissue bank.. SECTION CODE: B1, renal artery vein and ureter margin; B2, tumor in relation to renal pelvis; B3, tumor in relation to renal pelvis; B4, tumor in relation to renal pelvis and adjacent kidney; B5, tumor in
