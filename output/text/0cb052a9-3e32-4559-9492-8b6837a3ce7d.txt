The specimen is sectioned and a touch prep is taken. Toto A1. B. SLN #2 Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5cm. The specimen is sectioned and a touch prep is taken. Toto B1. C. LEFT BREAST WLE Received fresh is an oriented (short-superior, long-lateral, looped-anterior) 266g, 7.0cm anterior to posterior, 10.5cm superior to inferior and 12.0cm medial to lateral, lumpectomy with needie localization wire. The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-Blue, Posterior-Black, Superior-Red, Inferior-Orange, Medial-Green, Lateral-Yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices, slice 1 being most medial, slice 7 being most lateral to reveal a gray white stellate firm mass 2.6 x 1.8 x 1.4cm, 1 cm from the closest deep margin in slices 5 and 6. A 0.5 cm nodule is identified, 0.4cm from the deep margin and 1.5cm from the mass in slice 6. A 0.6 cm nodule is also identified, 0.5cm from the deep/lateral margin in slice 7. A surgical clip is identified in slice 6. A portion of the specimen is submmitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1-C3: medial margin perpendicular from superior to inferior slice 1 C4: superior/deep margin slice 2. C5: slice 2 C6: deep margin slice 2 C7: slice 2 C8: inferior margin slice 2 C9-C10: deep margin slice 3 C11-C13: slice 3 from superior to inferior with C13 inferior margin C14: deep/inferior margin slice 3. C15-C16: deep margin slice 4 C17-C18: next to mass slice 4 C19-C20: deep margin slice 4 C21: inferior margin slice 4 C22: superior margin slice 5 C23: deep margin slice 5 C24-C26: mass slice 5 C27: anterior margin slice 5 C28: inferior margin slice 5 C29: superior margin slice 6 C30-C31: deep margin slice 6 C32: above mass slice 6 C33: mass slice 6- clip C34: satetlite nodule slice 6 C35: area in between mass and nodule slice 6 C36: inferior margin slice 6

ADDTlONAL LATERAL MARGIN-Stitch at final margin Received fresh is an oriented 53g fragment of fibrofatty tissue 10.0 x 6.0 x 3.0cm. The new true margin is inked Blue and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal grossly unremarkable breast parenchyma Renresentative sections are submitted in D1-D10. E. MEDIAL LEFT BREAST TISSUE Received in formalin is a 321 g, 25 x 9 x 4 cm yellow-tan fibrofatty breast tissue with 17 x 5 cm skin. The breast parenchyma consists primarily of fatty breast tissue with few fibrous areas identified. No masses or lesions are seen. Representatively submitted in cassettes E1-E5. F. LATERAL LEFT BREAST TISSUE Received in formalin is a 238 g, 12 x 10 x 2.5 cm yellow-tan fibrofatty breast tissue with 12 x 8 cm skin. On sectioning no masses or lesions are observed. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes F1-F3. G. RIGHT BREAST TISSUE Received in formalin and are multiple pieces of yellow-tan fibrofatty breast tissue with the largest portion having attached tan skin. The specimen weighs 961 g; the intact tissue measures 40 x 11 x 4.5 cm. On. the surface are two irregularly shaped pieces of tan skin measuring 16 cm in length and 6.5 cm in width and 12 cm in length by 4 cm in width. The skin surface is unremarkable. The detached fibroadipose tissue in aggregate measures 12.5 x 8.5 x 3.5 cm. On sectioning the specimen is comprised primarily of adipose tissue. No masses or lesions are observed. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes G1-G10. DIAGNOSIS: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1) B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (O/1). C.
