Greater than 2 altered biomarkers are assoclated with increased risk of recurrence.. Note: Staining intensity based on 0 (neg) to 3+ (highest) Percent Positive Average: Percentage of tumor cells staining. HistoScore = Percentage of tumor cells staining (Scale 0-5) + Intensity. (Scale 0-3 These tests were performed IHC in conjunction with automated image analysis. The performanre characteristics of the above tests have been. determined in the While some antibodies have not been approved by the FDA, clearance / approval Is not mandated. These antibodies are well documented and clinically accepted prognostic indicators. These tests should not be regarded as part of research investigations. Known positive and negative control tlssue show appropriate staining. The above tumor blo-markers were performed per reflex protocol. The system used for image quantitation is the The method used for antigen retrieval is heat induced epitope retrieval. College of American Pathologists (CAP) required information for predictive/prognostic markers. Type of specimen fixation and detectlon system: polymer detection kits are used on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. Page 2 of 11
