The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report. Primar Clinical History Bladder cancer. Intraoperative Consultation.  Distal right ureter: Negative for carcinoma. (Microscopic A. evaluation). B. Distal left ureter: Negative for carcinoma. (Microscopic evaluation). D. Right pelvic lymph node: Benign lymph node. (Microscopic evaluation). Left pelvic lymph node: Negative for carcinoma. (Microscopic evaluation). Gross Description A.  Received fresh for frozen section labeled "distal right ureter" is a 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm segment of ureter. The specimen is inked yellow and entirely submitted in cassette Al-Fs. B. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "distal left ureter" is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm segment of ureter. The specimen is inked black and antirely submitted in cassette B1-Fs. C.  Received in formalin and labeled "bladder and prostate" is a 469 g, cystoprostatectomy specimen (15.0 x 13.0 x 6.0 cm). The specimen comes with an abundant amount of perivesicular adipose tissue attached. The cystoprostatectomy specimen consists of a bladder (6.5 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm) with attached right and left ureter (l.0 cm in length). There is a prostate (5.0 cm from left-to-right, 3.5 cm from anterior-to-posterior, 3.3 cm from apex-to-bladder-neck-margin) with attached right seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm), right vas deferens (12.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm). left seminal vesicle (3.5 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm), left vas deferens (3.0 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm). The right side of the specimen is inked blue; the left side of the specimen is inked black. In the left anterior and posterior lateral wall of the bladder, there is a 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm pink-tan polypoid mass. This lesion extends across the midline into the right anterior and posterior bladder and extends towards the bladder-prostate junction. The

Page 3 of 4 mass' cut surface is white-tan, firm and extends into the perivesicular fat. The mass at the posterior bladder, comes to within 0.5 cm to the perivesicular fat margin (inked black) and on the anterior bladder is 1.0 cm from the perivesicular fat margin (inked black). The lesion is 2.5 cm from the nearest peritonealized surface. The ureteral orifices are patent. There are no other discrete masses or suspicious areas grossly identified. The remainder of the mucosa is tan, glistening and pliable. The prostate has a white-tan cut surface with no discrete nodules or masses grossly identified. There are 5 lymph nodes dissected out ranging from 0.3 to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Also received in the container is a 38 cm in length and 0.8 cm in. diameter, brown-tan rubber tubing consistent with a catheter. Sections are submitted as follows: cl - right trigone, c2 - left trigone, c3 - posterior bladder-prostate transition, C4 - anterior bladder-prostate transition, C5-9 - mass in left lateral posterior wall, clo - mass and lateral anterior wall, cll - right lateral wall, c12 - posterior wall, cl3 - anterior wall, cl4 -. dome, c15 - right seminal vesicle insertion point and cross-sections through right seminal vesicle and vas deferens, c16 - left seminal vesicle insertion point and cross-section through left seminal vesicle and vas deferens, c17-18 - right anterior apex perpendicularly cut, C19-20 - left apex anterior prostate, c23-25 - right posterior prostate, c26-28 - left posterior prostate, c29 - 5 lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. D. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "right pelvic lymph node" is a single lymph node measuring 4.0 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette D1-FS and D2-Fs. E.  Received fresh for frozen section labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" are 4 lymph nodes ranging from 1.3 to 5.5 cm in greatest dimension. Sections are submitted as follows: El-Fs and E2-FS contains one lymph node (5.5 cm) inked blue and serially sectioned, E3-Fs - two lymph nodes, one inked yellow, one inked black, E4-Fs and E5-Fs - one lymph node (5.0 cm) inked orange and bisected.
