SPECIMENS: A. LT RAD NEPRECTOMY & RETRO PERITONEAL LYMPH NODES DIAGNOSIS: LEFT KIDNEY, ADRENAL AND RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY: - PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA. TYPE 2. FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3 - TUMOR SIZE 6.5 cm. - CARCINOMA EXTENSIVELY INVADING INTO RENAL HILAR ADIPOSE TISSUE - VASCULAR LYMPHATIC SPACE INVASION IDENTIFIED.  - CARCINOMA FOCALLY INVADING INTO VASCULAR WALL, BUT NOT IN LUMEN, OF RENAL VEIN. - LARGE MATTED HILAR LYMPH NODE (11 CM) AND THREE ADDITIONAL SMALLER LYMPH NODES, EXTENSIVELY REPLACED BY METASTATIC CARCINOMA (4/4). - URETERAL AND VASCULAR MARGINS, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.  ADRENAL GLAND, NO TUMOR SEEN. - SEE TEMPLATE AND NOTE. NOTE: There is focal necrosis and focal cystic degeneration identified in the tumor. No sarcomatoid. component is seen. Several small tumor nodules are present at the periphery of the main tumor, and. some of those nodules represent metastatic tumors in the angiolymphatic spaces. The metastatic tumor in the hilar lymph nodes shows perineural invasion. A panel of immunohistochemical stains was performed to rule out possible collecting duct carcinoma. The tumor is positive for CK20, RCC, EMA, and Cam5.2. It is negative for ULEX Europaeus agglutinin, HMW-CK, Vimentin, CK7 and CEA. There is weak stain of CK19, probably due to non-specific stain.. KIDNEY NEOPLASM TEMPLATE Specimen type: Radical nephrectomy, left, with adrenal gland Tumor site: Lower pole Tumor size: 6.5 x 6.1 x 5.5 cm. Tumor subtype: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 2. Histologic grade (Fuhrman's): Grade 3 Invasion Vascular/Lymphatic: Present Perinephric Tissue Invasion: Present Margins of resection: Margins free Adrenal gland: Uninvolved by tumor  Regional lymph nodes: Positive, the largest matted lymph node is 11 cm. (4/4) Stage: T3aN2 Primary tumor (T) TX: Cannot be assessed TO: No evidence of primary tumor. T1: Tumor <7.0cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney T2: Tumor >7.0cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney T3: Tumor extends into major veins or invades the adrenal gland or perinephric tissues but not beyond Gerota T3a: Tumor invades the adrenal gland or perinephric tissues but not. beyond Gerota's fascia T3b: Tumor grossly extends into the renal vein(s) or vena cava below the diaphragm T3c:  Tumor extends into vena cava above the diaphragm or invades the wall of the vena cava.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY AND RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES Received fresh in a container labeled with patient name and "left radical nephrectomy and. retroperitoneal lymph nodes" is a kidney and perinephric adipose measuring 15 x 7.5 x 7.0 cm together. The kidney alone measures 12 x 6 x 5 cm and has a 6 cm long, 0.6 cm diameter proximal ureter. At the renal hilum is a 15 x 5 x 4 cm portion of fibroadipose, nodular lymph nodes and probable tumor. Sectioning of the renal parenchyma reveals an inferior pole 6.5 x 5.5 x 6.1 cm firm, tan mass with irregular edges. Surrounding the main tumor mass the renal parenchyma contains multiple, small nodules of tumor that appear to be separate from the primary mass. Portions of the tumor cut surface show necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor invades hilar adipose and encases the renal artery and vein at the hilum. There is no tumor present in the lumen of vascular margins. Tumor also encases proximal ureter, but the ureter is probe patent. Tumor obliterates the renal pelvis. The 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm adrenal gland is hemorrhagic but uninvolved by tumor. Tumor appears to penetrate renal capsule only towards the renal hilum. There does not appear to be penetration of Gerota's fascia. Remaining renal parenchyma has a reasonably well defined cortico-medullary junction. Sectioning of the hilar soft tissue reveals that it is largely replaced by an 11 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm lobulate mass of tumor that is contiguous with the tumor in the kidney. Additionally, at the periphery of this main mass are multiple <0.5 cm separate, tan, well circumscribed nodules of tumor probably representing lymph nodes with metastatic disease. A1: urethral and vascular margins. A2-A8: renal tumor including extension into the hilar adipose and encasement of hilar. vascular and ureteral structures A9: a section of kidney adjacent to tumor with small tumor nodules. A10: hilar mass. A11-A12: possible metastatic disease in hilar lymph nodes. A13: adrenal
