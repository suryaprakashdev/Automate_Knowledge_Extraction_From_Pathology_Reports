PATIENTINFORMATIONAOAPSSMPAPR EAPNAPALASRNSARRSRAMREAEUERACRRCLINICALINFORMATION CLINICAL HISTORY: Preoperative Diagnosis: Abdominal mass, unspecific site. Postoperative Diagnosis: Symptoms/Radiologic Findings: SPECIMENS: Right kidney (tissue study) SAOAAESPECIMENDATANRENRSARSYAAARKNRTR GrOSS DESCrIPT!ON: Received in formalin labeled #d #1 right kidney (tissue study) is a 640 gm previously bisected nephrectomy specimen, consisting of a 13.8 x 8.1 x 3.6 cm kidney, with a moderate amount of attached perinephric fat. There is a minimal amount of attached renal vein and artery, and a 5.5 x 0.2 cm segment of ureter at the hilum. The capsule is smooth and tan-gray. The cut surface consists of an 8.4 x 7.9 x 3.4 cm, mottied tan-red to orange-yelow mass invoving the middle and lower poles. The cut surface of the mass consists of cystic, hemorrhagic, red-orange to yellow soft tissue. The mass grossly appears to abut the capsule and is 0.2 cm from the inked deep margin. The mass does not invoive the renal vein margin. The remainder of the cut surface consists of red-brown parenchyma. The corticomedullary junction is well-defined. The urothelium is glistening gray-white. The adrenal gland is present. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. The specimen is inked, serially sectioned, and representative sections are submitted as labeled:  Block 1 - ureteral and vascular margins; blocks 2 and 3 - mass to inked deep margin; block 4 - mass to uninvoived parenchyma; block 5 - mass to capsule; blocks 6 to 8 - mass; block 9 - uninvolved parenchy I 10.. adrenal gland. The blocks are labeled *. Also received in the  same container is a green-yellow and blue cassette labeled Or genomic research study. END.OFREPORT
