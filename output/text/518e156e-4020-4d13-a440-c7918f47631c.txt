Please evaluate margins and any submitted nodes. Operatlon Performed Right total mastectomy. Pre Operative Diagnosis: Triple negative carcinoma breast Speclmen(s) Received: Breast, mastectomy, partlal/simple Gross Descrlption.. Received in formalin is a mastectomy specimen, measuring 28.0 x 18.0 x 6.5 cm with an ellipse of skin attached, measuring 25.0 x 16.0 cm with a nipple attached. The specimen is oriented with one stitch marking the superior margin, two stitches marking the medial margin. The specimen has been prevlously opened with inked deep margin. Upon serial sectloning, there is an 8.5 x 7.4 .The cut surface appears to be necrotic with foci of x 5.8 cm white lesion located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast..  Additionally, there is a 4.5 x 3.5 hemorrhage. The rest of the breast appear unremarkable with a stroma to fat ratio of 20 to 80%.. x 3.0 cm white-tan firm lesion located in the axilla. Those lesions are approximately 0.3 cm to the deep margin. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1 Nipple 2 Tumor with skin : Tumor with deep margin Page 2 of 3
