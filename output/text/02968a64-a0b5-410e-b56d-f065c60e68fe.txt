AlU t1o13 Collection Date: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Renal mass, Left, partial Nephrectomy -- A.  renal CeLl CarcinOmA, with fEatures Of both papiLLAry (PapilLARy Type 2) AnD Clear CELl Pu TS8. clea cll festuies (CONVENTIONAL) TYPES (ses comment). CARCINOMA MEASURES 1.7 cm IN GREATEST DImENSION. : 5% B. CARCINOMA IS CONFINED TO THe KIDNEy. c FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE IS 3 OF 4. D. E. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA. F.  NO LyMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS SEEN G LimIteD bacKgrOund RENal Parenchyma with mODerate mIxed And fOCaLLy XANTHOGRANULOMATOUS INFLAMMATION, INCLUDING HEMOSIDERIN-LADEN MACROPHAGES. H. PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE (AJCC 7th EDITION): pT1a NX MX. COMMENT: Histologic sectlons show a malignant neoplasm composed of architecturally-crowded papillae of eosinophillc ceils with. abundant stromal macrophages. Moreover, focl of cytologically malignant cells with distinct clear cell features are also. identlfied in the periphery of thls lesion. Results of paraffin section immunohistochemical analysis aiso highlight both cell populations (see microscoplc description), thereby supporting the above rendered diagnosis.
