UUID: 16BE8338-E17B-4B8A-9D71-B0D83D73D9DE Redacted Final Diagnosis Yeast, Ieft, wide local excision and simple mastectomy: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade III (of III), [tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 3/3; Nottingham score 8/9], forming a 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm mass (in the wide local excision specimen) [AJCCpT2]. Extensive ductal carcinoma in-situ, high nuclear grade, present within (> 25%) and outside the invasive component involving an area measuring at least 3.8 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm.  Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative fibrocytic changes and multiple small intraductal papillomas. Biopsy site changes present. Multiple margins on the wide local excision specimen, including the separately submitted inferior margin, are positive for tumor. There is residual in-situ carcinoma in the mastectomy specimen adjacent to the biopsy cavity which is located in the outer quadrant. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All surgical margins, mastectomy, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 1.7 cm, deep margin). Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (3) left axillary sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN0 (i-) (sn)]. Blue dye is identified in left axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1 and No. 2. Blue dye is not identified in left axillary sentinel lymph node No. 3. Lymph node, left axillary non-sentinel, excision: A single left axillary non-sentinel lymph node (adjacent to left axillary sentinel lymph node No. 1) is negative for metastatic carcinoma. Estrogen and progesterone receptor analysis and Her-2/NEU have been ordered on paraffin-embedded tissue. /cs-0-3 carcnona, iifiltratirg cluct, ns 8500/3 Sij: bresst, Nos c50.9
