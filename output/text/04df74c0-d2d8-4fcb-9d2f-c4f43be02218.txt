SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT NOTE: THIS TUMOR IS COMPATIBLE AS THE PRIMARY SITE OF ORIGINFOR MATERIAL RECEIVED FROM THE PRIOR CYTOLOGY SPECIMENFROM THE LEFT NECKLYMPH NODE IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASEDUPON MYPERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL).AND THAT IHAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment CK7 CK20 34BE12 CD10 CA-1X. TTF-1 CD117 MUCIN IMMRECUT NEGCONT RACEMASE RECUT RECUT RECUT RECUT RECUT RECUT RECUT RECUT Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh labeled "left kidney" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter,renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 1478 g in total.The kidney measures 19.5 x 14.0 x 9.0 cm.The attached ureter measures 12cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 2 cm in length and 1.2 cm in diameter.The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable.An adrenal gland is not identified. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal 2 tumors.The first measures 15 x 13 x 12 cm.The second measures 3.0 x2.2x 1.9 cm and is located in the opposite pole.Both have yellow-white cystic and focally hemorrhagic cut surfaces. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma,with a well-defined cortico-medullary junction.The cortex measures 0.6 cm and the calyces appear normal. A 0.5 cm polyp is noted in the renal pelvis. One possible lymph node is identified in the perinephric fat.The specimen is photographed Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections. Summary of sections: UVM--ureteral and vessel margins T--tumor THF-- tumor with hilar fat TSF--tumor with sinus fat TK-- tumor with adjacent kidney RP- renal pelvis representative sections (including polyp) T2--smaller tumor K-- representative sections kidney LN-possible lymph nodes 2). The specimen is received fresh,labeled "Hilar lymph node"and consists of an enlarged firm lymph node with scant attached adipose tissue measuring 5.8 x 3.5 x 3.2 cm.on cut section the specimenit shows soft,necrotic. white-tan tumor.
