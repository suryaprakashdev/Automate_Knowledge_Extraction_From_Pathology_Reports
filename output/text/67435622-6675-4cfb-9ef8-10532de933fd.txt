RIGHT COLON RESECTION Specimen consists of resected short segment of right colon measuring 15 cm in length.,with attached adherent indurated adipose tissue. Large firm palpable mass occupies mid portion of the specimen ,which when the specimen is opened, shows an obstructing circumferential exophytic tumor measuring 4 x 3.7 x 3.5 cm, involving cecum and extending to ileocecal valve and seen 3 cm from ileal margin and 6 cm from distal colonic margin of resection. The tumor on sections shows a tan-cream-white surface and infiltrates entire colonic wall with apparent extension to subjacent adipose tissue. Tumor occludes cecal lumen. Attached adipose tissue measures 11 x 5 x 2.5 cm. Appendix is not identified. Multiple sections submitted and labelled as follows. A1-A4: one transverse section of tumor divided into four sections A5-A7: additional tumor representative. A8: colonic margin A9: representative of colon A10: representatives of ileum A11: distal ileal margin A12: three lymph nodes, one bisected and inked. A13: three lymph nodes, one inked and bisected. A14: three lymph nodes A15: one bisected lymph node LIVER BIOPSY Received in formalin is a portion of tan brown soft tissue measuring 1.2x0.7x0.5cm. which is previously partially bisected. The specimen is further sectioned and submitted completely in cassette B.
