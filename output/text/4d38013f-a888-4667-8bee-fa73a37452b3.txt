GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RENAL TUMOR Received fresh for frozen section are multiple cores of white-tan tissue, each measuring approximately 1.0 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette FSA1. B. FAT OVER TUMOR Received in formalin is a piece of yellow-pink soft tissue measuring 9.0x 5.7 x 0.5 cm. On sectioning, no masses, lesions or areas of thickening are seen. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes. B1-B5. C. LEFT RENAL TUMOR Received fresh for frozen section are three brown pieces of renal tissue measuring 5.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm,. 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, and 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Each fragment is oriented with a stitch at the surgical margin. The margins are inked orange, blue and black, respectively. Frozen section is performed on the margins. The specimen is submitted entirely in FSC1-FSC4 (frozen section of margins) and C5-C6. (the remainder of the specimen). D. LEFT RENAL TUMOR Received fresh is a piece of brown-tan kidney tissue weighing 117 gm and measuring 9.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm. The surgical margin is inked black and the external capsular surface is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 6.2 x 4.6 x 3.0 cm tan-pink cystic friable well-circumscribed mass Iocated 0.1 cm beneath the renal capsule. There are two cysts on the benign appearing parenchyma. measuring 0.4 and 0.7 cm in greatest dimension that contain brown-gold gelatinous material. A photograph is taken and sections of the tumor are procured for the tissue bank. Representative sections are submitted in D1-D3 (one cross section including capsule and surgical margin), D4-D5 (one. cross section including renal pelvis), D6-D9 (tumor), D10 (cyst), D11-D12 (normal appearing renal parenchyma).
