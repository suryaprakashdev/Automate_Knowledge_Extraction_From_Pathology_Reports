SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY: - MICROMETASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE LYMPH NODE, WITH NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION (1/1) (SEE NOTE). NOTE: There are two foci of micrometastasis, each measuring less than 1 mm in size. A cytokeratin AE1/3 stain was performed that highlights the micrometastases and also shows a few scattered cytokeratin positive cells in the parenchyma. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1). C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1). D. BREAST, RIGHD MASTECTOMY: - MULTICENTRIC INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTiATED (SBR GRADE 2) (SEE NOTE) - TUMOR MEASURES 1.2 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION - INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS WITHIN 1 MM OF THE ANTERIOR MARGIN IN THE UPPER INNER QUADRANT. - EXTENSIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), CRIBRIFORM, SOLID AND MICROPAPILLARY TYPES, NUCLEAR GRADES 2 AND 3, WITH NECROSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS, INVOLVING LOBULES - DCIS IS PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR MARGIN IN THE UPPER INNER QUADRANT. - DCIS INVOLVES LACTIFEROUS DUCTS. - SKIN AND NIPPLE, NO TUMOR SEEN. NOTE: In the upper outer quadrant, a biopsy site is noted with adjacent DCIS. Near the biopsy site, a 2 mm focus of invasive ductal carcinoma is seen. In the upper inner quadrant, there is invasive ductal. carcinoma with DCIS, with the largest focus of invasion measuring 1.2 cm and with at least one other. focus of invasion that measures 0.1 cm. The DCIS in the upper inner quadrant is mass forming and. spans at least 4 cm in greatest dimension. E. AXILLARY CONTENTS, RIGHT, LEVELS 1-2, DISSECTION: - 13 LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/13). F. BREAST, RIGHT, ADDITIONAL TISSUE, EXCISION: - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, PRESENT AT INKED ASPECT (SEE NOTE). NOTE: There is a 3 millimeter focus of DCIS. The tissue was not oriented but was inked entirely black and DCIS is present at the inked aspect. G. BREAST, RIGHT, ADDITIONAL INFERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION: - FOCAL COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE WITH CYTOLOGIC ATYPIA (FLAT EPITHELIAL ATYPIA). - NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA.

Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit ( i using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in- house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 mmunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. CLINICAL HISTORY:S -year-old female with abnormal screening mammogram of right breast at right upper outer quadrant. Need!e biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma. Patient then had MRI which showed enhancement of

upper outer quadrant and upper inner quadrant; anteriorly there was enhancement 2 cm from clip and close to nipple. PET, CT and bone scan show no evidence of metastatic disease. Invasive ductal carcinoma SBR grade 2, ER positive, PR positive, Her2/neu negative. Tumor size 0.4 cm, also with high grade DCIS solid and cribriform with necrosis and extension to lobules. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right Breast Cancer ADDENDUM: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Results:. HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FiSH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology Core Facility by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17 signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene.. Block used A1 Source of case: RPCI Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No:NA Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.05 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER- 2/neu gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test FDA APPROVED REAGENT PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of natients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the under the direction of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis..
