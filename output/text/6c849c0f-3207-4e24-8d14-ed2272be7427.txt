Patient Results m Number examined: 20 Number positive: 14 Pathoiogic Staging: pT3a N1 MX. Pathologic Findings in Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Mild, patchy, interstitial, chronic inflammation. Immunohistochemistry: RCC: Positive PAX-8: Positive CD10: Positive CK5: Negative p63: Negative Comments: The morphologic features and immunohistochemical profile supports the diagnosis of papillary renal cell carcinoma. Although spread into the ureter is unusual for renal cell carcinoma, the main kidney mass and tumor within the ureter share the same immunohistochemical profile and morphologic appearance, representing the same tumor.. This case has been reviewed and the diagnosis agreed upon by sultina departmental surgical pathology staff.. The gross description and all microscopic slides have been reviewed and interpreted by the undersigned pathologist' Electronically Signea Specimen(s) Keceiveu.

Patient Results m x 23.0 x 6.0 cm. The specimen weighs 1,270 gm. The kidney itself measures 12.0 x 6.5 x 5.0 cm. The attached adrenal gland measures 4.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The attached ureter measures 5.5 cm in length and has an average diameter of 0.4 cm. The kidney has been shelled out of the perinephric fat and bivalved by the surgeon. The perinephric fat is inked black. The capsular surface of the kidney is tan-brown. There are multiple small white granular lesions ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.5 cm on the surface. A portion of the tumor appears to be pushing the capsule out and this area measures 4.5 x 3.0 x 2.6 cm. It does not appear to be grossly invading through the capsule. Size, appearance and location of tumor: Bivalving the specimen reveals a tan-white to pink friable mass (5.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm) present within the center of the kidney. There is an additional small tan-pink nodule (0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm) at the proximal ureter. A representative section of the smaller mass is submitted in FSA1. A representative section of the large tumor is submitted in FSA2..  Renal capsule/Renal sinus: The tumor appears to be extending the capsule, but does not appear to grossly invade through the capsule into the perinephric fat. The tumor appears to abut the renal sinus; however, no gross invasion is identified. The small mass on the ureter does not appear to grossly invade into the ureter. Renal vein: Not clearly identified. Other findings: None.. Uninvolved tissues: The adrenal gland appears golden yellow with small punctate hemorrhage areas present. The uninvolved  renal parenchyma appears tan-brown. The medulla is tan-pink. The average cortical thickness is 0.9 cm. The uninvolved ureter serosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening. The uninvolved ureter mucosa is tan-white and striated. Lymph nodes: Five potential lymph nodes are identified in the hilum fat ranging in size from 0.4 to 1.1 cm. The larger nodes are firm and suspicious for tumor involvement. Blocks submitted: FSA1-FSA2 - representative tumor (large mass and smaller ureteral mass, respectively) A3 - representative shave margin of all vascular structures identified. A4 - entire small lesion found on the ureter and cross sections A5-A6 - representative sections of the tumor and its relationship to the sinus fat A7 - representative section of the tumor and its relationship to the renal pelvis and sinus fat A8 - representative section of the tumor and its relationship to the uninvolved renal parenchyma A9-A10 - representative section of the tumor and in its relationship to the capsule where it protrudes A11 - representative section of perinephric fat Printed from: Page: 3 of 6

The adrenal gland is golden yellow with red hemorrhagic tissue within the center. Serial sectioning of the adrenal gland demonstrates no grossly identified masses. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes B1-B3. (C) (para-aortic lymph nodes) Received fresh for frozen section is tan-red tissue measuring 5.0x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. Three firm lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 1.2 to 4.0 cm. the smallest lymph node is inked black and submitted intact along with one representative section of the middle-sized lymph node in FSC1. A representative section of the largest lymph node is submitted in FsC2. The remainder of the middle-sized Iymph node is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassette C3. The largest lymph node is serially sectioned and submitted in cassettes C4-C6. (D) (para-aortic lymph nodes) Received in formalin are two fragments of tan-red fibroadipose tissue measuring 7.0 x 10.5 x 4.0 cm. There are multiple surgical clips and sutures present. Additionally present are fragments of a vascular structure. Sixteen potential lymph nodes are identified which are firm and rang in size from 0.4 to 6.0 cm. Biocks are submitted as follows: D1 - representative sections of the vascular structures identified within the specimen. D2 - six potential lymph nodes intact D3 - three potential lymph nodes intact D4 - one matted lymph node bisected  D5 - one potential lymph node bisected D6-D8 - one lymph node serially sectioned D9-D10 - one lymph node serially sectioned D11-D14 - one lymph node serially sectioned D15-D16 - representative sections of one lymph node D17-D19 - representative sections of the largest lymph node (E) (part of interaortocaval) Received in formalin is one fragment of tan-pink fibroadipose tissue measuring 5.5 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm. Two large firm matted lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 3.0 x 5.5 cm. Blocks are submitted as follows: E1-E2 - representative sections from the smaller matted lymph node E3-E5 - representative sections of the larger matted lymph node (F) (distal ureter, left) Received in formalin is a portion of ureter measuring 5.0 cm in length and having a diameter ranging from 0.6 to 0.5 cm. There is a stapled and suture on one end of the ureter. This end of the ureter is inked blue. The ureter Printed from: Page: 4 of 6

Patient Results m is seriaily sectioned. Blocks are submitted as follows: F1 - the inked blue margin which was the one with a staple and suture on it as well as the opposite margin F2 - the remainder of the specimen serially sectioned Microscopic Description: Complete microscopic evaluation has been performed. Appropriately reacting controls have been performed and evaluated for all stains on this case as required. Histopathology has a list of iH antibodies that are regulated as analyte specific reagents (ASR's). These assays were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the They have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Aaministration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary for the ASR's. These tests are not investigational and are used in standard clinical care. In cases where Immunohistochemistry testing is performed, the following antibodies and their respective clones may be used to determine therapy for the patient: EFGR(3c6), ER(SP1), PR(1E2), Her2neu(4B5), CD117(Poly). CD20(L26) Ki67(30-9). Uniess otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for ERPR by IHC, Her2 by IHC and/or HER2 by FiSH have been tixed as per C.A.P. requirements for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 48 hours. ER, PR, Ki-67, p53 are reported as a semi-quantitative percentage of positively stained nuclei. Her-2/neu and EGFR are scored as follows: No staining at all is scored as (0), weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is scored as (1+), less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cels or complete strong staining in less than 30% of cells is scored as (2+), and strong complete staining in more that 30% of cells is scored as (3+). All studies are performed on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin unless otherwise stated in the report. Printed from: Page: 5 of 6
