Sentinel node #2, right breast. REPORT REVISED ON AT CLINICAL NOTES PRE-op DiAgnosIs: Bilateral breast carcinoma.. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS A) Lymph node, sentinel node left, excision: One lymph node negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1).. FFsl, FFs2: Palpable area, right axilla, biopsy - Benign lymph node present. GFs: Sentinel node #2, right axilla, biopsy - One lymph node with. no evidence of metastasis. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "left. sentinel lymph node #1" is an irregularly shaped fragment of blue stained tissue that measures 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. in dimension. Tissue is entirely frozen. B. Received fresh, labeled "left breast stitch 12 o'clock" is a 26.0 cm. (medial to lateral) x 24.5 cm.(superior to. inferior) x 4.5 cm.(anterior to posterior) diffusely cauterized and focally blue stained soft, lobulated tan gold-white portion of fibroadipose tissue in keeping with breast designated as left per requisition slip and container and oriented by a single suture as. stated previously. A 5.5 cm. (medial to lateral) x 2.3 cm.(superior GROSS DESCRIPTION to inferior) portion of dusky tan white skin with a central, everted, 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm. nipple is present along the anterior aspect. The deep margin is inked black and the specimen is. sectioned. There is a roughly spherical, 2.4 cm. clot-filled. biopsy cavity within the lower inner quadrant. The cavity is present within 1.2 cm. of the anterior surface (inked blue see block 2) and 2.8 cm. of the inked deep margin (see block 1). Several cylindrical tan white firm structures are evident within the cavity. The periphery of the cavity is fibrotic with diffuse chalky yellow fat. necrosis. Lateral to the cavity is an ill-defined focus of firm, tan white fibrous tissue with dilated ductal structures (see blocks 6 and 7). Within the center of the focus, there appears to be a

The remaining cut surfaces throughout the specimen consists predominately of glistening lobulated golden yellow adipose tissue with a moderate amount of interspersed focally blue stained dense tan white fibrous tissue. No additional mass lesions are identified. Representative sections are submitted in fourteen blocks as labeled. Rs-14. BLOck suMMARy: 1 - Biopsy cavity to inked deep margin; 2 - biopsy cavity to anterior surface; 3-5 - biopsy cavity to adjacent parenchyma; 6 - firm area lateral to biopsy cavity; 7-8 - apparent lesion lateral to biopsy cavity to inked deep margin; 9 - random upper outer quadrant; 10 - upper inner quadrant; 11 - lower inner quadrant; 12 - lower outer quadrant; 13 - junction of the four quadrant; 14 - nipple. C. Received fresh, labeled "tail of Spence", is a 5 x 4 x 1.6 cm. portion of soft, lobulated golden-yellow adipose tissue.  Three soft tan-pink-gold tissues, in keeping with lymph. nodes, measuring up to 1.5 cm. in greatest dimension, are The lymphoid tissues are entirely submitted in three blocks, as GROSS DESCRIPTION labeled.RS-3 BLOcK suMMARy: 1 - One whole presumptive node; 2,3 - one bisected presumptive node per cassette.

(12 to 6 o'clock) wrinkled tan-white skin ellipse, with a suture along one aspect, as stated previously. The 12 o'clock half is inked blue and the 6 o'clock half is inked black. There is a stellate, rubbery, 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. tan-white nodular lesion within the 9 o'clock half of the specimen, which appears to extend to within less than 0.1 cm. of the inked 12 o'clock surface. The specimen is entirely submitted in a sequential manner from 3 to 9 o'clock in four blocks (nodule block 3). E. Received fresh, labeled "right breast double long 12. o'clock, single long hard mass 10 o'clock" is 27.0. cm.(medial to lateral) x 23.5 cm.(superior to inferior) x 4.5 cm.(anterior to posterior) diffusely cauterized and focally blue stained soft, lobulated tan gold-white portion of fibroadipose tissue in keeping with breast designated as right per requisition slip and container and oriented by double suture as stated previously. A 4.4 cm.(medial to lateral) x 2.5 cm.(superior to inferior) dusky tan white skin ellipse with a central, everted, 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. nipple is present along the anterior aspect. A second single suture is present at approximately 9-10 o'clock. The

intact deep margin is inked black and the specimen is sectioned. There is a moderately well circumscribed, 5.0 cm.(superior to inferior) x 3.4 cm.(medial to lateral) x 3.0 cm.(anterior to posterior) multi-loculated slightly firm cystic structure subjacent to the aforementioned single suture at the junction of the upper and lower outer quadrants. The cyst focally extends to within 0.3 cm. of the inked deep margin (see blocks 1 and 2) and is 1.5 cm. from GROSS DESCRIPTION the anterior surface (subsequently inked blue). A portion of the cystic focus and a portion of normal parenchyma are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. The cut surfaces throughout the remainder of the specimen consists predominately of glistening lobulated golden yellow adipose tissue with a moderate amount of interspersed diffusely cystic tan white fibrous tissue. No mass lesion or additional abnormalities are identified. Representative sections are submitted in 16 blocks as labeled. Rs-16. BLOck suMMARy: 1-2 - Cystic structure to inked deep margin; 3-4 - cystic structure to inked anterior margin; 5-10 - representative cystic structure to surrounding parenchyma including firm area sequentially from lateral to medial; 11 - random upper outer quadrant; 12 - upper inner quadrant; 13 - lower inner quadrant; 14 lower outer quadrant; 15 - junction of the four quadrants; 16 nipple.
