Patient: Microcalcifications: Absent Additional findings: None MARGINS Regarding invasive carcinoma: Margin(s) positive: Posterior margin - 2mm linear extent Margin(s) negative: Superior:  >1 cm Medial: >1 cm Inferior: >1 cm Lateral: >1 cm ANCILLARY STUDIES IHC for ER and PR: Performed on a prior sample See report: HER2 amplification by FiSH:  Performed on a prior samole See report: REGIONAL LYMPH NODES Positive for metastatic carcinoma (at least one focus > 0.2mm in size). Number of nodes positive: Total number of nodes evaluated: 26 Size of largest metastatic focus: 5mm Extranodal extension: Present (tumor extends 2 mm or less beyond node capsule). Comment: The two positive lymph nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes from Part A (one sentinel node) and Part B (1 of 2 sentinel nodes).. STAGING (AJCC) Primary Tumor: pT3 Lymph Nodes: pN1a Distant Metastasis: Not applicable CLINICAL INFORMATION: Right breast multicentric cancer, ER/PR done previous biopsy. SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED: A. Right axillary sentinel node B. Right axiliary sentinel nodes C. Left breast tissue D. Right modified radial mastectomy with multicentric cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh is a 2.3 x 2 x 1.5 cm fragment of golden yellow fibroadipose tissue containing one rubbery. partially fat-replaced 1.1 x 1 x 0.4 cm lymph node. The node is bisected and submitted far frozen section in A1 FROzEN SECtiON DiAGNOSIS: Lymph node, positive for metastatic breast carcinoma: Pathology Report Page 2 of 4

Patient: B. Received fresh is a 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm fragment ot golden yellow fibroadipose tissue. Dissection reveals two rubbery. partially fat-replaced nodes, 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm. Both nodes are bisected and submitted for permanent section in 81 and B2. C. Received fresh are two fragments of tobular golden yellow fibroadipose tissue along with attached and  unattached smooth, unremarkable tan-red skin weighing 256 grams in aggregate and measuring from 5 x 3.4 x 2.2 cm to 16 x 11 x 3.5 cm. Sectioning reveals a cut surface consistent of lobular yellow adipose tissue interspersed with fibrous pink-white breast parenchyma. Representative tissue is submitted in C1 - C2. D. Fixed in formalin for approximately 33 hours is a 1,215 gram modified radical mastectomy with the breast proper measuring 20 cm from medial to lateral x 19.5 cm from superior to inferior x 7 cm from anterior to posterior. Dissection of the 11 x 6 x 4 cm axillary tail reveals several rubbery tan-red lymph nodes, 0.3 to 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm. There is an 18 x 9 cm ellipse of tan-red skin on the anterior surface with a superomedial placed nipple. The superior margin is inked black, inferior blue. medial green, lateral yellow and posterior red. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 17 slices measuring from 1 to 1.3 cm. In the upper outer quadrant of the breast is a large firm, multinodular, ill-detined 7 x 5 x 3.8 cm pink-gray mass which extends from the 9 to 11 o'clock position, 5-6 cm away from the nipple. This large, multinodular lesion appears grossly to come within 0.5 cm of the posterior margin, 1.5 cm of the superior margin and greater than 2 cm away from all remaining margins. In the upper inner quadrant of the breast at approximately the 2 o'clock position, 7-8 cm away from the nipple is a smalier, firm, ill-defined 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm pink-gray mass located 1 cm away from the superior margin and greater than 2 cm from all remaining margins. This mass appears grossly to be located 3.5 cm away from the larger lesion The rest of the specimen consists af lobular yellow adipose tissue interspersed with fibrous pink-white breast parenchyma. A photograph of slices 4 through 14 is taken to illustrate both lesions and their relationship to the inked margins. Sections submitted are indicated on the photograph and are sublabeled D10-D25. Sections to include the mass at 2 o'clock are in D10 and D11, and the mass at the 1 to 3 o'clack position is in D14. D15, 017. D20, D21. D22. D23. D24 and D25. The nipple is in D13, and an additional section of mediai breast is in D8 and lateral breast in D9. The lymph nodes are submitted as follaws: D1-D2 -- one node trisected: D3 -- one node bisected; D4-D7 -- intact lymph nodes; D8 -- medial breast tissue; D9 -- Iateral breast tissue. Slides were microscopically examined by the pathalogist Immunohistochemistry Results Formalin-fixed. paraffin-embedded tissue is utilized. Tissue sections are incubated with the following antibodies. Positive and negative controls stain appropriately. Camplete procedural methodology is available upon request. Results indicated below. Material: Block D22 Marker For: Result Comment e-Cadnerin Negative The immunohistochemical findings support the diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma. stigs of atl immunonistochemical stains cted in ths report were determined by the Department ot Pathoiogy at as part of an ongoing quaty assurance program and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn rrom ine Cunical Laboratory #provement Amendments of 1988 (CLiA '88) Some of these fests may rely on the use of *anaiyte specific reagents' and have not been cleared or approved by the U.S Food and Drug Adminrstration The FDA nas determined that such clearance or  approval is not necessary. Nevertheless. federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the fotowng disciaimer be attached to this report. These tests are used for rinral nurnneae and should not be regarded as investigational or for research The immunonistochemistry lataratory at Jepartment ot Pathoicgy is certified by the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services (formerly HCFA) as a hgh complexity laboratory uncer CLiA 88 Pathology Report Page 3 of 4
