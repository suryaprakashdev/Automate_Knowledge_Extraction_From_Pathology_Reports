MARGINS Uninvolved by carcinoma NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY PATHOLOGY Not identified PATHOLOGIC STAGING EXTENT OF INVASION pT1b. (Tumor more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney) REGIONAL LYMPH NODES pNX. (Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed) DISTANT METASTASIS pM0. (No distant metastasis) PATHOLOGIC STAGE Summary Final TNM: pT1bNXM0 I stage: I : The pathologic stage presumes no lymph node metastasis. ** The pathologic stage presumes no distant metastasis.. Attending Pathologist: CLINICAL INFORMATION -year-old female patient with a 4 cm right upper pole renal mass. discovered incidentally on imaging.. SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION A) SOURCE: Right kidney The specimen is received labeled and is designated "right kidney" and consists of a 333 gram right radical nephrectomy with associated adipose tissue measuring 12 x 16.5 x 4.5 cm. The vascular and urethral margins are removed and submitted en face. The kidney is bivalved revealing a 10 x 8 x 4 cm kidney containing a 4.5 x 4 x 2.4 cm yellow-red hemorrhagic-appearing lesion located within the upper pole. There is no tumor identified in the renal vein. The tumor appears to abut the renal capsule; however, no direct extension into the associated adipose tissue is grossly identified. Grossly this lesion comes to within 1.5 cm of the hilum. The remainder of the renal cortex has a pale tan-red appearance with an average cortical thickness of 0.6 cm. No other discrete mass lesions are identified. A portion of the tumor is taken for possible cytogenetic study and representative tissues are frozen for possible ancillary study. No lymph nodes are present within the associated adipose tissue and no adrenal gland is identified. A photo was taken of the specimen. The specimen is sampled in 11 cassettes as follows: 1. Ureteral margin, en face Vascular margins, en face 2 3-5. Representative sections of tumor 6-7. Tumor and adjacent normal parenchyma 8-9. Uninvolved renal parenchyma 10-11. Representative random hilar fat Gross dictation by: MICROSCOPIC The microscopic appearance substantiates the diagnosis. Dictation by. transcribed by Mireto. cARemop repancy m
