L MACROSCOPIC: 0 *Left adrenal gland'. The specimen consists of an adrenal gland, 504 g and 110 x 110 x 85 mm. The adrenal gland is largely replaced by a 100mm tumour. The G tumour is multinodular and has a variable cut surface with solid tan lobules, Y yellow/orange areas, and areas of haemorrhage, cystic change and necrosis. The tumour appears at least partially encapsulated and there is no macroscopic evidence of invasion. A small amount of uninvolved adrenal is identified at the periphery of the tumour. A1/A2 - Tumour with adjacent uninvolved adrenal gland. A3 - A6: Central tumour. A7 - A10: Tumour with overlying capsule. MICROSCOPIC: The left adrenal tumour is an adrenal cortical carcinoma (Weiss criteria). The tumour is composed of polygonal cells showing a predominantly diffuse, A sheet-like growth pattern with areas of myxoid degeneration which are divided N in areas by fibrous septa. The cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with a few scattered clear cells present. The nuclei are enlarged and pleomorphic A with coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Mitoses are readily identified T (13/50hpt), including atypical forms, and there are broad areas of necrosis and haemorrhage. No vascular invasion is identified. While the tumour does extend 0 to the adrenal capsule it appears to be confined to the adrenal gland and local excision is complete. M Immunohistochemistry shows positive staining for inhibin,calretinin and Melan 1 A and negative staining for chromogranin. The rnorphological features and immunohistochemical protile are in keeping with c an adrenal cortical carcinoma. a SUMMARY: L Laft adrenal gland: Adrenal cortical carcinoma. STAGE: II(pT2, NX, MX). (AJCC Staging, 7lh Edition) P ADDITIONAL REPORT A The tumour has a Weiss score of 6. T Ki67 stains between 25-36% of tumour cells in the most proliferative areas. KdS. H 0 L 0 nf2
