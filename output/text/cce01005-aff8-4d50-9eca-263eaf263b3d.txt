SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Surgical Pathology Report Diagnosis: A: Omentum, mass, excision  - Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with colonic primary B: Terminal ileum, appendix and right colon, right hemicolectomy Tumor Histologic Type: Invasive moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma Histologic Grade: 2 Tumor Location: Right colon Depth of Invasion: Through muscularis propria into the subserosa, pericolic soft tissue Lymphovascular Invasion: Not identified Perineural Invasion: Not identified Margins: Proximal margin: Negative Distal margin: Negative Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative but close, <1.0 mm Distance of carcinoma from closest margin (specify): <1.0 mm from serosal surface; 8.5 cm from proximal mucosal margin.. Regional Lymph Nodes: Total number with metastasis: 1 Total number examined: 24 Additional pathologic findings: Appendix with follicular lymphoid hyperplasia and no tumor seen; tumor satellite nodule identified.. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3 pN1a Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical. review and additional information. C: Liver mass, Segment 5, removal - No evidence of metastatic disease. - Benign liver with minimal steatosis and mild portal triaditis D: Hernia sac, removal - Benign fibrovascular and fibroadipose soft tissue, consistent with hernia sac, with focal foreign body giant cell reaction with associated polarizable foreign material; no evidence of metastatic disease. Clinical History: large mass in the ascending colon. Biopsy demonstrates invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. CT imaging confirms mass and evidence of metastatic disease. Gross Description: Received are four formalin-filled containers. Container A: SITE: "omentum" METHOD: excision MEASURE: 6.5 x 3.6 x 1.5 cm COMMENT: yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue with a central firm hard mass; cut section demonstrates a white/yellow firm surface. BLOCK: A1, omental mass Container B:

Specimen fixation: formalin Parts of bowel received: terminal ileum, cecum and proximal ascending colon. Specimen length: 27.3 cm Orientation: The specimen was received with a stitched end which appears to be the right ascending colon, inked blue. The distal ileum is inked black. Tumor location: tumor is located just distal, but apparently involving the ileocecal valve Gross appearance of tumor: distal to the ileocecal valve is a ulcerated mass with whorled edges, this mass is firm; proximal to this is the ileocecal valve and this also appears to be at least superficially studded with tumor Tumor dimensions: 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.2 cm Circumferential growth: 70% Gross depth of invasion: the mass appears to grossly invade the subserosal soft tissues Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: no. Luminal obstruction: no Bowel circumference at tumor site: 6.0 cm. 1.5 cm diameter at tumor site Gross distance of tumor from margins: 9 cm from blue inked distal margin, 8.5 cm from black inked proximal margin Lymph nodes: per block summary Other remarkable findings: The rest of the colon and ileum are grossly unremarkable. Appendix is present with the specimen and is not grossly involved. Tissue submitted for special investigation: tissue submitted to Tissue Procurement Digital photograph taken: no Block Summary: (Inking: proximal ileal margin=black, distal right colonic margin with stitch=blue) B1 - appendix, longitudinal section of tip, cross section of base B2 - proximal (black inked) margin, en face  B3,B4 - distal (blue inked) margin, en face B5 - section of mass. B6,B7 - additional section of mass, bisected B8 - mass in relation to pericolic fat B9 - section of ileocecal valve B10 - additional section of ileocecal valve B11 - five lymph node candidates B12 - five lymph node candidates B13 - five lymph node candidates B14,B15 - one grossly positive node, bisected B16 - four lymph node candidates B17 - two lymph node candidates Container C: SITE: "liver, Segment 5" METHOD: biopsy MEASURE: 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm COMMENT: tan/brown soft tissue mass BLOCK: C1, Container D is additionally labeled "hernia sac." It holds three pink/tan soft tissue fragments measuring 2.5 x 1.9 x 0.8 cm in aggregate
