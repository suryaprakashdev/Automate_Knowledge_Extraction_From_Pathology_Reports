Stomach: final gastric margin:. - negative for carctrioma 12. Stomach and'esoptagus: final #2 gastric and esophageal ring margin:. - negative for carcinoma . Comment 5 and 6. The tumor involves dista! esophagus and extends into the stomach for a distance of 2.0 cm. The tumor is focally ~ 0.5 mm from the esophageal adventitial margin and also involves perigastric fat. The proximal part of the tumor is polypoid and is in a background of intestinal metaplasia in residual glandular mucosa.. There is focal mucinous differentiation with small mucin pools and there is focal area of poorly differentiated tumor. The. mucinous component represents approximately 20% of the tumor. There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 3/17 lymph nodes identified. There is infiltration of perinodal adipose tissue in specimen #7, labeled lymph node station 17.. One lymph node in specimen #6, labeled lymph node station 7, shows small hyalinized nodules with anthracotic pigment and microscopic birefringent particles. There are no acid fast bacilli or fungi are identified by the ZN and PAS stains. Synoptic Data Clinical History: Not known: Specimen: Esophagus Proximal stomach Procedure: Esophagogastrectomy Primary Tumor Site: Distal esophagus (lower thoracic esophagus) Additional Sites Involved by Tumor: Esophagogastric junction (EGJ)  Proximal stomach and esophagogastric junction Relationship of Tumor to Esophagogastric Junction: Tumor midpoint lies in the proximal stomach or cardia and tumor involves the. esophagogastric junction Distance of tumor center from esophagogastric junction: 1.5 cm Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma Histologic Grade: G3:  Poorly differentiated Tumor Size: Greatest dimension: 3.8 cm Additional dimension: 1.9 cm Additional dimension: 0.6 cm Microscopic Tumor Extension: Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the periesophageal soft tissue. (adventitia) Proximal Margin: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. Uninvolved by dysplasia Distal Margin: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. Uninvolved by dysplasia Circumferential (Adventitial) or Deep Margin: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. All Margin Status All margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: 0.5 mm Closest margin: Circumferentia!. Treatment Effect: No prior treatment Page 2 of 5
