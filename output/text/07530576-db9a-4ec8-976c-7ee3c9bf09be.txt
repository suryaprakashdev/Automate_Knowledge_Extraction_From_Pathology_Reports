TCGA-AK-3453 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Clinical History/Diagnosis: Right Renal Mass Source of Specimen(s):. 1: Right kidney, portion of right ureter (with stent) and para caval nodes 2: right ureteral Stent Gross Description: Received in two parts. Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "right kidney, portion of right ureter. and paracaval nodes". Frozen Section Diagnosis: 1FS- ONCOCYTIC NEOPLASM PER Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section evaluation labeled , right kidney, portion of right ureter and. paracaval nodes" is a 333 gram right nephrectomy having a minimal amount of attached perinephric fat. There is a 9.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of attached ureter having a lumen, 0.2 cm containing a stent. The kidney itself is distorted, 9.0 x 8.5 x 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. It is bisected to reveal a 8.5 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm mass protruding from the kidney having. yellow-tan to brown to red-purple focally hemorrhagic cut surfaces Representative sections of the mass are submitted for frozen section evaluation and the frozen section residue is submitted in one block. The remaining renal parenchyma is tan-brown having a well-defined. cortico-medullary junction. There are no palpable lymph nodes in the attached paracaval soft tissue. Representative sections are submitted in six blocks. Designation of Sections: 1FS- frozen section renal mass, 1A- ureter and vascular margins, 1B-1D- tumor, 1E- random kidney section, 1F- representative sections paracaval soft tissue. Summary of Sections: multiple. Note: Tissue is Submitted for Cytogenetic Studies and Gross Photographs are Taken. ************************************ ************************************ Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled # 2, "right ureteral stent". Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled ", right ureteral stent". It consists of a single lumen segment of light green stent measuring 54.2 x 0.4 cm. In the same container is a similar segment of stent measuring 2.9 cm. No blood or tissue present,

gross only.. ************************************************************************ Final Diagnosis:. 1. Right kidney, portion of right ureter (with stent), para caval lymph. nodes, resection:- Low grade renal cell carcinoma, 8.5 cm, suggestive of oncocytoma with transition to chromophobe tuinor.... - Extracapsular extension is not seen. - Lymphovascular invasion is not seen.. - The vascular and ureteral margins are negative, see note. 2. Right ureteral stent:. - Gross description only. Note: The tumor is focally positive for CD10, CK7 and AE1/AE3, and negative for. colloidal iron, vimentin, CD117, E-cadherin and RCC antigen. Positive and negative control slides are satisfactory Background biotin staining cannot be eliminated. These results support a diagnosis of oncocytoma, but appearance shows chromophobe features. These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the immunohistochemistry laboratory at the These tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical. testing. Procedures/Addenda FC Setup Charge Solid Tumor. Results-Comments CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS DIAGNOSIS: Right Renal Mass KARYOTYPE: Specimen inadequate for cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: The renal tumor was minced and distributed among four flasks The specimen was contaminated with bacteria from inception and could not be cultured.
