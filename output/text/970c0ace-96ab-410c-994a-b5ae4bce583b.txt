Clinical Diaanosis & History: vith right renal mass. Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Right kidney & adrenal glan 2: SP: Right paracaval nodes DIAGNOSIS: 1) KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND, RIGHT; RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY: - RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CHROMOPHOBE TYPE. - THE TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER IS 18 CM. - THE TUMOR IS CONFINED WITHIN THE RENAL CAPSULE - NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. -ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR - THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY IS UNREMARKABLE. - THE ADRENAL GLAND IS UNREMARKABLE. 2) LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PARACAVAL; EXCISION:  - EIGHT BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/8). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL),AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Special Studies: Result  Special Stain Comment RECUT RECUT RECUT 1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right Kidney and Adrenal Gland". It consists of a kidney, adrenal gland and.  tumor. The specimen measures 19 cm (superior-inferior) x 14.5 cm (anterior-posterior) x 17.2 cm (lateral).The specimen weighs 1,800 grams.The adrenal gland is disrupted and measures 8.7 x 3.1 x 0.7 cm.The ureter measures 6.5 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm.The. tumor measures 18 x 15 x 13.5 cm.  The adrenal gland appears to be uninvolved by tumor.  On the cross section, tumor has a centrally located scar and appears to be light mahogany in color. There are some areas of hemorrhagic. The tumor arises from the superior pole of the kidney and appears to be well-demarcated.  The kidney measures 9.5 x 7.5 x 6 cm.
