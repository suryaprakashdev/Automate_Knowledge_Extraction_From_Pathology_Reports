Small focus of an atypical ductal proliferation. Surgical resection margin, no invasive or in situ carcinoma identified. Skin, no tumor identified.. See comment. Entire report and diagnosis completed by COMMENT In the left mastectomy specimen, there is extensive DCIS which is associated with both foci of invasive carcinoma. The DCIS involves an area of breast tissue which is estimated to measure 7 to 8 cm. The two toci of invasive carcinoma are separated by approximately 2.0 cm of breast tissue which has foci of DCIS. There is a morphologic spectrum of DCIS ranging from low grade to high grade with necrosis. Both invasive carcinomas have an associated prominent lymphocytic response. The nuclear grade of the invasive carcinoma ranges from intermediate to high grade. The additional submitted margins and final margin status were discussed with Dr.. The additional submitted margins (specimens D-F) appear to cover the superficial aspect of both tumors.. Specimen  has skin and breast tissue and the true surgical resection margins (superior/lateral aspect of the specimen) are negative for invasive and in situ carcinoma. There are some glands at the deep aspect of this specimen which are most likely benign but are difficult to interpret due to cautery artifact. This area does not correspond to true surgical margin.. Specimen F has skin and breast tissue, and the true surgical resection margins (inferior/lateral aspect ot the specimen) are negative for invasive and in situ carcinoma. In this specimen, there is a small focus of a cauterized atypical ductal protiferation present at the superior edge of the specimen which does not represent true margin in this specimen. The differential diagnosis includes a small focus of residual DCiS, atypical ductal hyperplasia or secretory change with cytologic atypia. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, NOT BLUE, COUNT 9 - A single lymph node (1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm). The specimen is serially sectioned and four touch preparations are performed. Entirely submitted in A1-A2.. *TP/DX: NO TUMOR IDENTIFIED. (B) LEFt BREASt, AXILLARY CONTENTS, SHORt STItCH AT 12 O'CLOCK - A radical mastectomy specimen measures 27.0 x 18.0 x 4.0 cm with an ellipse of skin (5.5 x 5.0 cm), unremarkable nipple (0.8 x 0.8 cm) and axillary contents (9.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm). The specimen is serially sectioned trom medial to lateral into 16 slices. The nipple is located on slice 7. Located at the outer upper quadrant, 1 o'clock, approximately 7.0 cm from the nipple is an ill-defined firm, white mass (2.5 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm). The mass is approximately 0.6 cm from the closest superior superficial margin. Another ill-defined firm area (1.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm) is interior to the first mass in the lateral aspect of the breast at approximately 2 o'clock. This lesion is approximately 2 cm from the 1 o'clock tumor, does not appear to be connected to the 1 o'clock tumor, and abuts the inferior superficial margin. There is an exophytic granular area on the skin surtace at about 11 o'clock, measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The remainder of the specimen is unremarkable. The specimen is radiographed after slicing. The suspicious areas are marked by the radiologist. Multiple lymph nodes are identitied.. Representative section of the normal and tumor tissue are submitted for tumor bank. INK CODE: Blue - superior, orange - inferior, black - deep.
