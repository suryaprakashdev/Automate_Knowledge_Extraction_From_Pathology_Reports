LT BREAST SIMPLE MASTECTOMYS B. LT SENTINEL NODE #1 C. LT SENTINEL NODE #2 RECEIVED IN 3 PARTS. PART A RECEIVED LABELED SIMPLE LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK, IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMENS MEASURING 17.5 X 16 X 2.8 CM.  THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 9 X 2.5-CM SKIN ELLIPSE.  ADDITIONALLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER ARE 2 IRREGULARS FRAGMENTS OF FATTY TISSUE WITH NO PALPABLE MASSES TOGETHER MEASURING 4.5 X 3 X 0.5 CM.  THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEPS WITH BLACK.  SECTIONING REVEALS 2 DISCRETE GRAY FIBROUS NODULES; THE MOST LATERAL IS AT 3 O'CLOCK MEASURING 1.5 X 1.1 X 1.5 CM. ADJACENT TO THIS SEPARATED BY 1.5 CM IN THE 6:30 AREA IS A MASS WITH A COIL CLIP MEASURING 2.2 X 1.8 X 2.1 CM. THESE ARE BOTH 0.5 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. CENTRALLY, THE BREAST HAS DENSE TAN FIBROUS TISSUE, BUT THE PERIMETER OF THE SPECIMEN AND THE TISSUE ADJACENT TO THE DEEP MARGIN IS YELLOW FATTY TISSUE.  THE 3 O'CLOCK LESION IS O.7 CM FROM THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN.  THE 6 O'CLOCK LESION EXTENDS TO WITHIN O.6 CM OF THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A1--NIPPLE; A2--TISSUE BETWEEN THE TWO LESIONS; A3--3 O'CLOCK LESION TO INCLUDE DEEP MARGIN; A4--3 O'CLOCK LESION TO INCLUDE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN; A5 AND 6--FULL CROSS-SECTION OF 6 O'CLOCK LESION TO INCLUDE THE DEEP AND SUPERFICIAL MARGIN, RESPECTIVELY; A7--6 O'CLOCK LESION; A8--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT; A9--UPPER INNER QUADRANT; A10--LOWER INNER QUADRANT; A11--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT. TISSUE FROM EACH LESION IS SUBMITTED PER PROTOCOL.S PART B  RECEIVED LABELED LEFT SENTINEL NODE #1 HOT AND BLUE, IS AN OVOID FRAGMENT OF YELLOW-RED SOFT TISSUE MRASURING 1.7 X 1.0 X 0.9 CM. SECTIONING REVEALS A GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE 1.3-CM LYMPH NODE WITH CENTRAL FAT REPLACEMENT AND BLUE COLORATION. THIS IS SUBMITTED LABELED B, BISECTED. PART C RECEIVED LABELED LEFT SENTINEL NODE #2 HOT
