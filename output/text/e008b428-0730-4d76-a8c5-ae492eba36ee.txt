CASE SUMMARY FOR NEPHRECTOMY FOR RENAL CELL CARCINOMA: Procedure: Partial nephrectomy Specimen laterality: Right Tumor site: Anterior upper pole, per operative report Tumor size: 1.3 cm Extent of disease: Tumor limited to kidney. Histologic type: Papillary type 2 Sarcomatoid features: Not identified Histologic grade (Fuhrman Nuclear Grade): Not applicable to papillary subtype. Margins: Uninvoived by invasive carcinoma Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified Pathologic staging (pTNM): as follows: Primary tumor: pT1 (tumor 7 cm or less, limited to the kidney) Regional Iymph nodes: pNx, lymph nodes not sampled. Distant metastasis: Not applicable Pathologic findings in nonneoplastic kidney: Focal chronic inflammation. Other tumors and/or tumor-like lesions: Not identified AJCC Staging (7th edition) pT1 pNX pM- not applicable Right colon, partial colectomy: Mucinous Adenocarcinoma (see case summary). See comment 1. CASE SUMMARY FOR COLON AND RECTUM: Resection, Including Transanal Disk Excision of Rectal Neoplasms Tumor site: Transverse colon, per operative report Tumor size: Unknown size of the primary tumor (previously partially resected). Macroscopic tumor perforation: None detected Macroscopic intactness of mesorectum: Not applicable Histologic type: Mucinous adenocarcinoma Histologic grade: High grade Microscopic tumor extension: Tumor invades muscularis propria. Margins: Negative Proximal margin: Negative Distal margin: Negative Circumferential (radial) or mesenteric margin: Negative Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: 3.5 cm from the distal margin. Treatment effect: Not applicable Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified Perineural invasion: Not identified Tumor deposits (discontinous extramural extension): Not applicable. Type of polyp in which invasive carcinoma arose: Tubulovillous adenoma with at high grade dysplasia (per previous report at outside institution) Pathologic Staging (pTNM):
