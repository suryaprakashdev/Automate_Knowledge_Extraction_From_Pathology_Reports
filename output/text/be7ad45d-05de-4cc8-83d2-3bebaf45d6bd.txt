Surgical Pathology Report : * Final Report *. x 0.7 x 0.6 cm portion of tan-yellow fibroadipose tissue. Within the tissue is a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm lymph node candidate. The candidate is bisected along its longitudinal axis, and one alcohol-fixed touch preparation. as well as. one scrape preparation are prepared from the cut surface. The candidate is entirely submitted as two sections in one cassette. double short medial, is a 5.8 cm (cranial to caudal) x 4.2 cm (medial to lateral) x 2.0 cm (superficial to deep) portion of fibroadipose tissue, oriented. as stated above.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin is inked black. Sectioning demonstrates a stellate, moderately well circumscribed 2.6 x 2.2 x 1.0 cm white, indurated mass.. Within the mass is a 0.4 cm in greatest dimension hemorrhagic biopsy cavity.  The mass demonstrates the following measurements of the margins: medial-0.3 cm, lateral-0.9 cm,  The remainder of the parenchyma is composed entirely of lobulated adipose tissue. There are no additional discrete mass lesions or nodules identified.  Seven sections are submitted in seven: "A-g". Block summary: "A", medial perpendicular; (differentially inked) perpendicular; "p", superficial perpendicular; "e", deep perpendicular; "y", caudal shave; "g", cranial shave. Representative fresh tumor and normal tissue provided to I and the. #5 Labeled right breast mass, cranial margin, is a 5.0 x 3.2 x up to 1.3 cm cup-shaped portion of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue, oriented with a cranial map marker on one surface."  The cranial margin is inked black and tangential. sections are taken. The remaining tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate no gross focal mass or lesion. Six representative sections are submitted in. perpendicular sections through the remaining tissue. #6 Labeled right breast mass, medial margin, is a 3.0 x 3.0 x up to 1.0 cm. cup-shaped portion of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue, oriented with a medial map marker on one surface.  The medial margin is inked black. The tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate no gross focal mass or lesion. The tissue is. entirely submitted as nine perpendicular sections in six: "A-r".. cup-shaped portion of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue, oriented with a caudal map  The caudal margin is inked black. The tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate no gross focal mass or lesion. The tissue is entirely submitted as eight perpendicular sections in five: "A-e".

Surgical Pathology Report * Final Report * #8 Labeled right breast mass, lateral margin, is a 3.3 x 2.3 x up to 0.9 cm cup-shaped portion of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue,  oriented with a lateral. map marker on one surface. The lateral margin is inked black. The tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate no gross focal mass or lesion. The tissue is. entirely submitted as eight perpendicular sections in four: "A-D".. 9  Labeled right breast mass, deep margin, is a 5.0 x 3.2 x up to 1.6 cm. cup-shaped portion of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue, oriented with a deep map. marker on one surface. The deep margin is inked black, and tangential sections. are taken. The remaining tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate no gross focal mass or lesion. Seven representative sections are submitted in five: "A-E"  Block summary: sections through the remaining tissue..
