Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Lefl kidney and ureter 2: SP: Para aortic lymph nodes. 3: SP: Preaortic lymph nodes. 4: SP: Suprahilar lymph nodes and adrenal gland DIAGNOSIS: SP: Left kidney and ureter: Tumor Type:  Renal cell carcinoma - Unclassified type The tumor is high grade with a combinalion of papillary, tubular and clear cell foaturos and focal desmoplastic stroma. Tumor Size: Greatesl diameler is 11.5 cm.. Local Invasion (lor renal cortical types): Involves renal sinus lat Tumor involves perinephric fat Renal Vein invasion: Not identified Surgical Margins: Free of tumor Non-Neoplastic Kidney: chronic pyelonephritis, nephracalcinosis and focal cortical scarring and cysts. Adrenal Gland: Not identified See pait 4 Lymph Nodes: Not identified Slaging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocyloma:  pT3a Tumor invades the adrenal gland or perinephric tissues but nol beyond Gerola's fascia Comment:  The tumor cells are diffusely irnmunoreactive for RACEMASE and CD10; and focally posilive for CEA, 34BE12. and CK7, CAlX and cytokeratin AE1-AE3 are negative in tumor cells.

Para aortic lymph nodes; dissection: -Nine benign lymph nodes (0/9). 3.  Preaortic lymph nodes: - Ten benign lymph nodes (0/10) Suprahilar lymphinodes and adrenal gland:. 4. - Benign adrenat tissue. - No lymphoid tissue identified. TATTEST THAT THE A8OVE DIAGNOSIS I$ HASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Special Studies: Resull Spocial Stain Comment CK7 RACEMASE CA-1X. CD10 348E12 CEA P AE1:AE3 IMM RECUT NEG CONT Gross Description: 1)The specimen is received frosh fabeled "lelt kidney and ureter" and consisls of a kidney with attached ureler, renal vessels and. perinephric tat weighing 853 g in lotal. The kidney measures 17.5 x 11 x 9 cn. The atlached ureter measures 11 cm in length. and 0.3 cm in diameter. The atlached renal vein measures 1.4 Cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identified. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a hemorrhagic brght yellow to tan friable nass at the upper pole of the kidney mcasuring 11.5 x 0 x 8cm.. The mass is sharply circumscribed trom the adjacent kidney parenchyma and grossly extends into the perinephric fat and abuts Gerola's fascia which is inked black. Tunor exlends to within O.5 cn of the ronal sinus. Sections lhrough the remaindor of the kidney reveal a pink brown  parenchyna, with a well-detined corticomedullary junction and several cortical cysts filled with straw colored serous luid in the. inferior portion of the kidney measuring up to 2 cm in greatest dimension each.. The cortex measures 0.7 cm and the calyces. appear normat.  Lymph nodes are not identified in tho perinephric fat. The specimen is photographed. Representative sections are submitted lo id for permanent sections.

The specinen is received in formalin, labeled "Para-aortic lymph nodes" and consists of six pink tan frm, falty lymph nodes. ranging from O.5 to 2.7 cm in greatest dirmension.
