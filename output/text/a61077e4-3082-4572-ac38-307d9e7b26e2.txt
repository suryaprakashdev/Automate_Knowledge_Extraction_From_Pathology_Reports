xx [], mD Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the Resident/Fellow, [], M.D., Ph.D.. Electronically Signed Out by [], MD Clinical History: The patient is a :year-old female with history of bladder cancer undergoing. cystectomy. Specimens Received: A: Right pelvic lymph nodes. B: Left pelvic lymph nodes C: Right distal ureter D: Ovaries, tubes and uterus E: Bladder and round ligament F: Right pelvic lymph node Gross Description: The specimens are received in six containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh for intraoperative diagnosis is a 6.5 x 4.8 x 1.5 cm aggregate of lobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes to reveal multiple apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.2-2.5 cm in greatest dimension. One representative lymph node is submitted for frozen section and read as "reactive lymph node, NEOT" by Dr. []. The frozen section remnant is submitted as A1 FS. The remaining apparent lymph nodes are submitted as follows: A2-4: 2 lymph nodes each cassette; A5-6: 4 lymph nodes each cassette B. The second container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph node". Received fresh for intraoperative diagnosis is a 6.5 x 4.5 x 1.0 cm aggregate of lobulated yellow fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes to reveal multiple appearing lymph nodes ranging from 0.8-3.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections of a small lymph node and a large node are submitted for frozen section and read as "2 active lymph nodes, NEOT' by Dr. [] The frozen section remnant is submitted as B1 FS and B2 FS. The remaining appearing lymph nodes are submitted as follows: B3: Remaining portion of large lymph node; B4: Remaining portion of the small lymph node; B5-7: 5 lymph nodes each cassette; B8: 7 lymph nodes; B9: One lymph node bisected; B10: One lymph node sectioned; B11-12: One lymph node sectioned C. The third container is additionally identified as, "right distal ureter". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.5 cm unoriented segment of ureter. The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted as C1.. D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "uterus, tubes,. ovaries". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a hysterectomy specimen, weighs 479.1 gm with bilateral adnexa. The uterus measures 7.8 cm from fundus to

lower uterine segment by 7.5 cm from cornu to cornu by 11.3 cm from anterior to posterior. The serosal surface is red-tan, and glistening with a prominent serosal bulge (2.4 cm in greatest dimension, at anterior/fundal aspect). The cervix is not present with the specimen. The anterior surface is inked blue and the posterior surface is inked black. The specimen is opened revealing a 0.9 cm endocervical canal remnant lined with tan-pink rugated mucosa and an endometrial cavity distorted by submucosal nodules measuring 0.5 cm from cornu to cornu by 6.5 cm in length and lined with hemorrhagic and thickened, endometrium measuring 0.2 cm in thickness. The specimen is sectioned revealing pink-tan myometrium which is distorted on the anterior, posterior and fundus with multiple, rubbery and whorled nodules measuring from 0.7-6.0 cm. On cut section the nodules are devoid of hemorrhage, calcifications, necrosis, or hemorrhage. The myometrium has a maximum wall thickness of 3.5 cm and is coarsely trabeculated. The right adnexa consist of a 4.5 cm long and 3.0 cm wide portion of soft tissue. The fallopian tube with fimbriated end is not identified. The serosa is pink-red and glistening. The attached white-tan, cribriform ovary measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm and is sectioned to revealed white dense ovarian stroma with a 2.5 cm hemorrhagic cyst filled with semisolid material. The left adnexa consist of a 3.5 cm long and 2.5 cm diameter fimbriated fallopian tube. The serosa is pink-red and glistening. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a pinpoint lumen and a 0.4 cm wall thickness. The attached white-tan, cribriform ovary. measures 3.8 x 2.1 x 1.3 cm and is sectioned to revealed fibrotic white and ovarian stroma with few small cysts measuring up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension and filled with hemorrhagic solid material.. Representative sections are. submitted as follows: D1: Anterior cervix remnant, entirely submitted D2: Posterior cervix remnant, entirely submitted D3-4: Anterior endomyometrium (D3: With nodules, D4: Full thickness) D5-6: Posterior endomyometrium D7: Whorled nodules D8: Right ovary and right adnexal soft tissue. D9: Left fallopian tube D10: Left ovary and surrounding soft tissue. E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, "bladder and round ligament". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 61.9 g, 17 x 13.5 x 3.7 cm cystectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The bladder measures 9 x 7 x 3 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2.2 x 0.6 cm and the left 1.0 x 0.7 cm, and both demonstrate patent lumina. The urethral margin is inked black. The right half of the bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked black. Also received in the same container are 2 detached tubular structures, measuring 2.8 x 1.0 cm and 4.3 x 0.6 cm. The bladder is opened laterally along the urethra. The bladder demonstrates a 6.0 x 5.8 x 2.0 cm exophytic, pink-tan, friable mass attached to the anterior wall and 2.3 cm from the urethral margin. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion into the submucosa to a depth of 0.5 cm, extending to 1.5 cm of the inked margin. There is a 2.0 x 1.5 cm ill-defined area of plaque-like raised mucosa identified in the posterior wall, about 2 cm lateral to the. aforementioned tumor. The remainder of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and glistening with a uniform 1.2 cm wall thickness. The bilateral ureteral orifices are identitied and probe patent. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are

E4-5: Mass at deepest invasion (full thickness, tandem sections) E6-10: Multiple tumor sections, and surrounding normal looking mucosa E11: Raised lesion on the posterior wall E12: Uninvolved dome E13: Uninvolved posterior wall E14: Uninvolved right wall. E15: Uninvolved left wall. E16: Uninvolved trigone F. The sixth container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 7.0 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm aggregate of lobulated yellow fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph. nodes to reveal multiple apparent lymph nodes ranging from 1.0-5.0 cm in. greatest dimension.
