Tumor: Normal: Diagnosis: Low Grade Oligodendroglioma (who grade II) MIB-1 LI= 13.4% Addendum Discussion: Numerous MIB-1 reactive cells are scattered throughout. A labeling index of 13.4% is. calculated. This is indicated of a highly proliferative neoplasm and differs from the low grade histologic features seen on the H&E section. The MIB-1 does demonstrate a few. mitotic figures which were not identified previously. However, their number never exceeds 2 per 10 high power fields and is not sufficient to warrant classification as anaplastic. Microscopic Description: Sections demonstrate a focally markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter. There is focally prominent intratumor hemorrhage.. The neoplasm is composed of cells with mildly enlarged, mildly atypical round nuclei,. most often with perinuclear halos. No mitotic figures are seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.
