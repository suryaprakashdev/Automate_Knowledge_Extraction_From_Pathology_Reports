PROCEDuRE: Operative Findings: left kidney and retroperitoneal lymph nodes removed  Post-Operative Diagnosis: left renal tumor Pre-Operative Diagnosis: left renal tumor SPECIMENS SUBMITTED: 1. ADRENAL GLAND, LEFT, Portio n of Gland 2. KIDNEY, LEFT, Portion of gland 3. LYMPH NODES, Para and Inter Aortic Caval GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received at Surgical Pathology is a formalin-filled container labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, date of birth, and further designated as: 1. "Portion left adrenal gland". The specimen consists of an adrenal gland segment measuring 4 x 1 x 1 cm. There is no palpable nodule within the specimen. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in 5 white cassettes labeled as iA-1E. 2. "Left kidney". The specimen consists of an intact kidney with  attached perinephric fat measuring 16 x 9 x 6 cm and weighing 343 grams collectively. The isolated kidney measures 14.8 x 8.4 x 5.5 cm and weighs 305 grams. The perirenal fat capsule is inked with black. Extending from the renal pelvis are 2 ureters.  The upper  ureter is 5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The lower ureter is 8 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. Renal vein is 0.5 cm in  length and 0.6 cm in diameter and the upper renal artery branch is 1.8 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter, the lower one is 1.0 cm In length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The perirenal fat layer is stripped, revealing the intact renal capsule, which is inked blue. Tumor does not extend to the ureters, arteries, and vein and is not present at the resection margin. The kidney is bisected, revealing an 8 x 7 x 4 cm circumscribed solid pink mass without hemorrhage and necrosis in the upper pole of the left kidney. It is 1.0 cm from the renal hilum. The mass is confined by the renal capsule and does not invade the perinephric fat. The uninvolved renal parenchyma is tan-brown with a well-defined cortical medullary junction and ordery cortical striations and medullary raise. The pelvis and calyx appear smooth. There are no lymph nodes or stones identified. Gross photographs are taken. In the upper pole, there is a 0.5-cm erythematic area, presumably the core biopsy site. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A-D - relationship between tumor and the renal capsule. E-G - relationship between tumor and the pelvis. H - relationship between tumor and normal kidney tissue I-O, X-Z, AA, BB - representative sections of the tumor. R - the upper ureter margin Contidential Patient Intormation.
