SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT * Final Report *. D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "Apical urethral margin-F/s". It consists of a 1 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm soft brown-tan tissue fragment. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette Drs. E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "bladder and prostate".  It consists of a prostatectomy specimen with an overall measurement of 34 x 13 x 4.2 cm. The peritoneum measures 28 x 16 x 3 cm. The bladder itself measures 9 x 9 x 2 cm. The peritoneum is not involved by tumor. Attached to the. bladder is a segment of right ureter that measures 4 cm in length and 2.5 cm in circumference and a left ureter measuring 3 cm in length and 1 cm in circumference. The prostate measures 4.7 x 4 x 3.5 cm. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.5 x. 1.5 x 0.5 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 2 x 1 cm. The outer surface of the specimen is inked black..  Opening the specimen anteriorly reveals a. prostatic urethra that measures 3.7 cm in length and 3.6 cm in circumference. The verumontanum measures 1 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm.  The right posterior bladder mucosa, at the area of the right ureterovesical junction, shows 4 x 4 cm gray-tan ulcerated lesion with necrotic surface.  Sectioning of the ulcerated lesion shows a mass that. invades through the entire wall thickness of the urinary bladder and extends into the perivesical fat. At the request of the surgeon, an intraoperative pathologic consultation is performed in order to aid in the care of this patient. Representative sections are submitted in 26 cassettes.
