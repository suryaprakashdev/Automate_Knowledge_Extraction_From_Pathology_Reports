RUN DATE: PAGE 2 RUN TIME: RUN USER: SPEC #: PATIENT : (Continued) COmmenT(S) (Continued) MARGINS : Invasive carcinoma: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Distance from closest margin: 7 mm, deep LYMPH NODES: Number of sentinel lymph nodes examined: Number of lymph nodes with macrometastases: 0 Number of lymph nodes with micrometastases: PATHOLOGIC STAGING: Primary tumor: pT1c Regional lymph nodes: pN0 (i-) Distant metastases: Not applicable ANCILLARY STUDIES: Estrogen receptor: Results: negative (<1% of tumor cells with nuclear positivity) Progesterone receptor: Results: negative (<1% of tumor cells with nuclear positivity) HER-3: Immunoperoxidase studies: Results: negative (score 0) GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in two parts. Both parts are received labeled with the patient's name. A. Received in formalin. labeled with the patient's name and "right sentinel node" is a 3.5. x 2.5 x 2.0 cm portion of yellow. lobulated adipose. The adipose is trimmed to have a. flattened. 2.6 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm nodular. fatty lymph node. The node is sectioned perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node protocol cassettes Al-A3. B. Received fresh for tissue banking. labeled with the patient's name and "right breast" is a 962 gram. 23.0 x 20.0 x 4.5 cm fibrofatty breast consistent with simple mastectomy specimen. There is a suture designating the region of the axilla and an overlying 12.5 x 4.5 cm black-brown skin ellipse. The skin ellipse has a central. 5.0 x 4.5 cm areola which extends to the skin margins and a central 1.3 cm erect nipple. The deep margin is predominantly smooth and intact with a focal. minor. inferior medial area of disruption. The deep margin will be inked blue and the breast is serially sectioned to have a diffusely fatty parenchyma. The upper inner quadrant has a 1.7 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm tumor mass. The mass. is 2.5 cm from the superior peripheral margin. The . is 17 cm from the inferior peripheral margin. is approximately 4 cm from the medial peripheral margin and at least 16.5 cm from ths lateral peripheral margin. The tumor comes to within 0.7 cm of the deep margin. The remainder of the breast has glistening, yellow adipose with diffuse. delicate and focal scant dense-white fibrous tissue. There is a central area of possible fibrocystic change. The white fibrous tissue makes up between 15 and 20% of the parenchyma and is more pronounced towards the medial aspect of the breast. No additional indurated lesions or tumor-like masses are identified. Representative sections are sampled as labeled: B1 perpendicular section of nipple B2 section of tumor adjacent to tumor collected for tissue banking ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE ** lw g/3 3
