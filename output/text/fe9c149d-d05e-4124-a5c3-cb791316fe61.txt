IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL)AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment RECUT Gross Description: 1).The specimen is received fresh,labeled Right kidney,Perihilar node en bloc, and right adrenal  and consists of a total nephrectomy specimen with attached perinephric fat,renal vessels,ureter,adrenal gland and perihilar nodes weighing 1098 g post fixation.The kidney measures 16.3 x 12.5 x 7.9 cm.The attached ureter measures 9.4cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The adrenal gland measures 5.3 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm. The ureter and vessel margins are identified, and appear pink tan-pink and grossly uninvolved by tumor. In the area of the hilum,few loosely attached possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.4 to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension.The capsular surface of the kidney is pink-tan and smooth,and appears grossly uninterrupted. The specimen is bisected to reveal a well-circumscribed pseudoencapsulated red-tan focally hemorrhagic soft tumor mass measuring 9.5 x 8.9 x 7.8 cm,occupying the superior and mid pole of the kidney.The mass extends to but does not appear to grossly involve the renal pelvis.On cut section, roughly at the center of the tumor mass, an ill-defined paler white tan finely granular and slightly indurated area is identified measuring 5.5 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimension with ill-defined areas of focal hemorrhage also noted. The remainder of the mass is soft tan and focally hemorrhagic with liquefactive necrotic appearing areas noted. A thin rim of focally hemorrhagic pink-tan a firm possible renal parenchyma is identified partially surrounding the tumor Sections of theperi-nephric fatty tissue reveal an unremarkable cut surface.The ureter is opened to reveal pink-tan corrugated mucosa with no discrete abnormalities grossly noted. The inferior renal sinus is grossly unremarkable.On cut section, the adrenal gland is grossly unremarkable. At the inferior pole of the kidney,the cortical medullary junction is well delineated with a cortex measuring up to 1 cm.Further sectioning reveals a 0.8 cm smooth walled cyst at the inferior pole.The remaining renal parenchyma is pink brown and unremarkable.Representative sections of the specimen are submitted fo for permanent section, and photographs have been taken. Summary of sections: UM-ureteral margin shaved VM-vascular margins shaved HN-possible peri-hilar lymph nodes RST-representative sections TWC-tumor with capsule and perinephric fat NK- normal kidney NKC-normal kidney with cyst RP-renal pelvis A-representative adrenalgland RS-renal sinus 2).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "retroperitoneal lymph nodes"and consists of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.All identified lymph nodes are submitted.
