LCD-O-3 leeenora),renaI eeQS Skronyphel type 8317|3 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Case Number : Ce4.9 q/13 W87 Diagnosis: A: Soft tissue, small bowel nodule, biopsy. - Bland spindle cell proliferation, consistent with mesenteric fibromatosis - See comment B: Small bowel, colectomy - Segment of small bowel with bland mesenteric spindle cell proliferation, consistent with mesenteric fibromatosis, 5.1 cm in greatest diameter - Fibromatosis extends into muscularis propria of small bowel and into surrounding fibroadipose tissue'of mesentery and is <l mm from the cauterized margin - Bowel margins appear histologically viable and are negative for fibromatosis with distal small bowel margin (B3) demonstrating mild acute serositis. - Three lymph nodes, negative for malignancy (0/3) - See comment C: Gallbladder, cholecystectomy - Mild chronic cholecystitis Redacted - Negative for fibromatosis D: Kidney, right, partial nephrectomy Procedure: Partial nephrectomy Laterality: Unilateral, right side. Histologic tumor type/subtype: Renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe subtype; see comment Sarcomatoid features: None identified. Histologic grade (if applicable): Fuhrman grade 2 of 4 Tumor size (greatest dimension): 4.6 cm. Tumor focality: Unifocal Extent of tumor invasion (if present specify if macroscopic or microscopic) : Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: Negative for

malignancy Gerota' s fascia: Negative for malignancy Renal sinus: Negative for malignancy Venous (large vessel): Not identified Lymphatic (small vessel): Not identified Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Renal parenchymal margin (partial nephrectomy only): Negative for malignancy; tumor is 5 mm from the parenchymal margin Renal capsular margin (partial nephrectomy only): Negative for malignancy Paranephric adipose tissue margin (partial nephrectomy. only): Negative for malignancy; tumor is 2 mm from the perinephric adipose tissue margin. Adrenal gland: Not received Lymph nodes: Not received Pathologic findings in non-neoplastic kidney: - No fibromatosis identified - Patchy minimal glomerular sclerosis AJCc Staging: pT1b pNX This staging information is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Comment: Immunohistochemical stains are performed on block B4,a representative section of the mesenteric mass, and demonstrate the mass is negative for pancytokeratin, cdli7, s1o0, and muscle specific actin with slight focal staining for desmin and blood vessels outlined by cD34. Note is made of the patient's and Dr. prior pathology and the pathology referral to. opinion. The current specimen demonstrates prominent vasculature and focal fascicular architecture, consistent with mesenteric fibromatosis. Dr. notes in his comments on the prior pathology that a subset of fibromatoses can be beta catenin negative (which was the case with the patient's prior pathology). Given the overall appearance of the tumor and immunohistochemical profile, we favor mesenteric fibromatosis. Dr. has reviewed select slides from specimen B along with the immunohistochemical stains and concurs with the diagnosis of

mesenteric fibromatosis. Immunohistochemical stains are performed on block D1 and demonstrate the renal tumor is positive for cDli7, patchily positive for cdio and negative for racemase, Rcc, and vimentin, consistent with the chromophobe variant of renal cell carcinoma. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis: An intraoperative consultation is requested by Dr. FsAl: Small bowel nodule, biopsy - Blind spindle cell proliferation, defer subclassification to final with IHC. - No overt evidence of sarcoma or carcinoma identified Dr. and, PA at. Frozen Section Pathologist: Clinical History: -year-old male with mesenteric mass; core biopsy diagnosis of. blind spindle cells and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. (see surgical pathology case: ). Gross Description:. Specimen A is labeled "small bowel nodule, biopsy" and is a 2.2. x 0.5 x 0.4 cm wedge of serosa with 0.5 cm nodule. A 2.2 cm staple line is removed and inked blue. The nodule is bisected and submitted entirely in FsAl, Specimen B is labeled "small bowel tumor" and the requisition states "short stitch is proximal, small bowel margin, long stitch is duodenal margin" and holds a tortuous segment of small. bowel approximately 45 cm long with an open circumference of 4.5 cm. The specimen is received oriented as stated above. Within the mesentery there is a 5.1 x 4.6 x 3.5 cm firm mass. The fat overlying the mass at one edge is roughened, focally cauterized and inked green. Embedded within this fat and marked by the surgeon as the duodenal margin is a 2.5 cm long staple line which is removed to reveal small bowel mucosa. This margin is submitted as an en face section. Sectioning through the mass reveals that it has a white whorled firm cut surface. The mass comes to within 1 cm of the green inked roughened mesenteric surface, is <0.6 cm from the stapled duodenal margin, and is >5 cm from the proximal and distal small bowel mucosal margins.

The mass is centered within the mesenteric fat and does not involve the adjacent segment of small bowel. No additional abnormalities are noted. The small bowel serosa is tan/pink and glistening. Opening reveals tan glistening folded unremarkable mucosa. No lesions or masses are noted. A portion of the mass is submitted to tissue procurement.. Block Summary: B1 - Stitched duodenal margin, en face. B2 - Proximal small bowel margin, en face. B3 - Distal small bowel margin, en face B4-B5 - Mass with respect to duodenal mucosa, green inked roughened surface, perpendicular B6-b9 - Additional sections of mass. B10 - Three lymph nodes Tissue remains in formalin. Specimen c is received in one appropriately labeled container. Previously opened or disrupted: No Measurements: 8.6 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm External surface: Purple/smooth Luminal contents: Red liquid bile. Stones present: No Mucosa: Red and velvety Wall thickness: 0.1 cm Other comments:. Block #: c1 - Cystic duct margin and representative sections Tissue remains in formalin. Specimen D is labeled "kidney tumor right partial nephrectomy" and holds a 73.4 gram 6.2 x 5.5 x 4.2 cm partial nephrectomy. The parenchymal margin is red/brown and inked blue. The capsule is red/brown, smooth and inked black. Within the specimen there is a 4.6 x 4.2 x 4.0 cm tan soft well-circumscribed bass that bulges on cut section. The mass comes to within 0.4 cm of the blue inked parenchymal margin and abuts the capsule but does not extend through it. A portion of the mass and normal is submitted. to tissue procurement. The adjacent uninvolved kidney parenchyma. is red/brown and unremarkable. Block Summary:. D1-D2 - Mass with respect to blue inked parenchymal margin, perpendicular D3-D4 - Mass with respect to black inked capsule D5 - Kidney parenchyma away from mass Jw 7/30|i3 Tissue remains in formalin.
