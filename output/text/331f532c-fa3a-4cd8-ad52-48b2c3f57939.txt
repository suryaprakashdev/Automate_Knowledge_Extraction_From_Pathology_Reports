The lesion extends into the dermis and is 0.3 cm from the skin surface. Within the inferior aspect of the mandible, just overlying the salivary gland, there is a 1.8 cm in greatest dimension grossly positive lymph node candidate. Sectioning through the salivary gland reveals a normal lobulated surface with no discrete, grossly suspicious lesions identified. The lesion also extends into the muscular tissue and lies 0.5 cm from the red medial margin. The lesion is 0.7 cm from the anterior margin, 0.9 cm from the posterior margin, 1.2 cm from the blue inked lateral margin and greater than 3.0 cm from the nearest green inferior margin. No additional lymph node candidates are identified. Representative sections are submitted. A portion of tumor is submitted and placed in glutaraldehyde and within the -80 freezer on hold for possible future studies.
