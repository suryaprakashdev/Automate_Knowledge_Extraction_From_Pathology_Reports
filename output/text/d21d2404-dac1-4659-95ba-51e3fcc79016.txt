The specimen is inked as follows: superior-red, inferior-orange, medial-  green, lateral-yellow, anterior-blue, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 6. slices; slice 1 being most lateral, slice 6 being most medial to reveal multiple gray-white nodular areas, the largest of which measures 0.9 cm in greatest dimension and is located 0.3 cm from the anterior margin. The entire specimen is submitted as follows: A1-A3: lateral margin perpendicular sections taken from superior to inferior slice 1 A4: superior margin slice 2 A5: anterior and posterior margin slice 2 A6: inferior margin slice 2 A7: superior margin slice 3 A8: anterior and deep margin slice 3 A9: inferior margin slice 3 A10: superior margin slice 4 A11: anterior and deep margins slice 4 A12: inferior margin slice 4 A13: superior margin slice 5 A14: anterior and deep margin slice 5 A15: inferior margin slice 5 A16-A17: medial margin perpendicular sections submitted sequentially from superior to inferior slice 6 B. LEFT SIMPLE MASTECTOMY Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "left simple mastectomy, stitch in axilla" is a 560 g, 21 x 20 x 3 cm mastectomy with an 11 x 5.7 cm skin ellipse with 0.5 cm well healed scar in the lower outer quadrant, 1.5 cm areola, and a 1 cm everted nipple. Inked as follows: superior anterior = blue, inferior anterior = orange, deep margin = black. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a 2.5 x 2.3 x 1.7 cm well-circumscribed firm tan mass in the upper outer quadrant that is 1.5 cm from the deep margin. A portion of tumor is submitted for tissue procurement. In. the lower outer quadarnt, there is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm hemorrhagic biopsy site, 3.7 cm from the mass. 0.3 cm lateral to the biopsy site is a firm tan nodule, 1.3 cm in diameter.

Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2 HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit), :. Control Stides Examined: External kit-slides. provided by manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and neyative HER2 protein expression), and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma identified for HER2 evaluation.. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern. Negative (0)/Absence of Staining  Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Ceils Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not  indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ resuits. COMMENT  This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall  survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was  determined as IHC 3+ or FiSH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase  disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and  adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical  staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and  guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and  guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC  as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without  knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FiSH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC  and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were  interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FiSH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified.  The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance  and has programs in place to regutarly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The

laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE 1.
