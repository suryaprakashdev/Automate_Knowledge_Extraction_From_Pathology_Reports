I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OFS THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL),AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "sigmoid colon and consists of a segment colon measuring 16.2cm in length with a circumference of 5.0 cm at the stapled resected margin and 4.8 cm the open resected margin. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 1.5 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal an ulcerated mass lesion measuring 1.1 cm in length and 0.7 cm in width.The mass is located 10.0 cm from the stapled margin and 6.3 cm from the open margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the submucosa. The depth of invasion is 0.4 cm grossly.They is a 0.1 cm polyp located 3.0 cm from the open resection margin.There are several diverticuli with. associated muscular wall and pericolic adipose tissue thickening. The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and ali identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS. Summary of sections: S -stapled margin shave 0-open margin shave tumor,entirely RS -0.1 cm polyp and representative section from colon DIV- diverticuli LN-lymph nodes ** Continued on next page **

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Proximal margin" and. consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm.. At the center of the pin, a white plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan. soft tissue is attached measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The mucosal surface is. pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.. Summary of sections: U  undesignated 3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal margin" and consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm.. Multiple sutures and staples are attached..  The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic.  The sutures and staples are removed and the soft. tissue is entirely submitted..
