Comment: This trozen section diagnosis/result was communicated to and acknowledged by. in at per Intraoperative Consultation D LIVER AND GALLBLADDER: Lesion grossly measures 1.1 cm from parenchymal margin. Gross Description A.  Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section labeled *left lateral segment 3 excisional. biopsy." The specimen consists of a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5-cm, tan-gray, soft tissue, which is entirely. submitted for frozen section labeled FSA1. B. Specimen B is received fresh for frozen section labeled *left lateral segment 2 nodule." The. specimen consists of a 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.2-cm, tan-gray, soft tissue, which is entirely submitted for frozen. section labeled FSB1. C Specimen C is received fresh for frozen section labeled "periportal adenopathy.* The specimen consists of a 1.8-cm lymph nade with a small amount of attached fat. The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section labeled FsC1. D Specimen D is received fresh labeled "liver segment 4B and 5, and gallbladder.* The. specimen consists of a 116-g, 8.6 x 5.1 x 4.3-cm wedge of liver with an adherent 8.7 x 3.3 x 2.2-cm gallbladder. The capsule is indurated surrounding the adherent gallbladder with a small amount of attached fat. Sectioning through the liver at the adherent gallbladder reveals a circumscribed, 3.4 x 2.7 x 2.4-cm, gray-white tumor, which extends to the overlying capsule to the soft tissue surrounding. the gallbladder. No extension into the gallbladder wall is identified. The tumor is 1.1 cm from the

The fat adjacent to the neck of the neck of the gallbladder is focally indurated. The medial parenchymal margin is inked red, fateral yellow, superior. blue, and deep black. The fat attached to the liver capsule is inked green. Representative sections are submitted labeled.
