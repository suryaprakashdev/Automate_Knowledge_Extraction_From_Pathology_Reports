Sentinel lymph node #1, left axilla:. - Single lymph node, no tumor (0/1). B. Left breast lumpectomy: - Invasive ductal carcinoma, SBR grade III, with focal necrosis and associated 1ymphocytic infiltrate. See parameters below. - Ductal carcinoma in situ, solid type, high nuclear grade, associated with invasive carcinoma. - Unremarkable uninvolved breast parenchyma. Breast Pathologic Parameters 1. Invasive carcinoma:. A. Gross measurement: 2.8cm B. Composite histologic (modified SBR) grade III - Architecture: 3 - Nuclear grade: 3 - Mitotic count: 3 C. Associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): high nuclear grade, <5% of tumor volume, associated with invasive carcinoma. 2. Excisional biopsy margins: Free of tumor - DCIS >1 cm from nearest margin. - Invasive carcinoma 7mm from posterior (closest) margin 3. Blood vessel and lymphatic invasion: Absent 4. Axillary lymph nodes: Negative for tumor 5. Special studies (performed on current material):. - No reactivity for ER (no staining). - No reactivity for PR (no staining) - Her2/neu (FISH) is pending. 6. pTNM: pT2, N0(sn), MX. Clinical History: year-old female with a left breast cancer undergoing left breast sentinel lymph node biopsy and partial mastectomy..

Specimens Received: A: Left axillary sentinel lymph node #1 B: Left breast partial mastectomy Gross Description: Specimens received in two containers each labeled with the patient' s name and medical record number. A. Part A is additionally designated 'left axillary sentinel lymph node #1.' Received fresh for frozen diagnosis is a 2.4 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm lymph node which is bisected. Half of the lymph node is frozen and read as no carcinoma per Dr. Chang. The remnant of frozen tissue is entirely submitted in cassettes A1FS. The remnant of non-frozen tissue is submitted in cassette A2.. Part B additionally designated '2 left breast partial mastectomy double short stitch superior, double long lateral'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 114 gm partial mastectomy specimen. The measurements are as follows: Superior to inferior 7.0 cm, medial to lateral 9.8 cm, and anterior to posterior 4 cm. There is skeletal muscle on the posterior aspect of the lumpectomy specimen measuring 3.8 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is inked as follows: Superior blue,. inferior green, posterior red, anterior black, lateral purple and medial yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral and to 11 slices. There is a 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm well-circumscribed firm tan-pink mass which demonstrates focal hemorrhage. This mass is 1.1 cm from the inferior margin, 0.7 cm from the posterior margin, 3.5 cm from the superior margin, 1.1 cm from the anterior margin, 2.2 cm from the lateral margin and greater than 5 cm from the medial margin.. B1-B2: medial margin. B3-B7 lateral margin. Clearly sectioned and entirely submitted. B8-B10 : representative sections of mass from slice 7 demonstrating relationship to red ink margin (posterior) B11: representative site of section of mass in slice 8 showing relationship to green margin. B12: representative section of slice 8 showing skeletal muscle on posterior aspect B13-B15: representative sections of mass in slice 9 showing relationship to red.. green, and black inked margins. B16: representative section of slice 9 demonstratingskeletal muscle at closest approximation to mass. B17: representative section of normal breast parenchyma, site unspecified
