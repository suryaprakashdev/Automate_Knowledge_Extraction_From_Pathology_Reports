SIGMOID COLON B. PROXIMAL DONUT C. DISTAL DONUT CLINICAL HISTORY: None GROSS DESCRIPTION: A.  SIGMOID COLON Received fresh is a 20.Ocm. segment of colon with both margins received stapled closed measuring. 4.5cm. in diameter and 5.Ocm. in diameter. The attached portion of pericolic fat measures 20.0x6.5x2.5cm. Upon opening, the mucosa shows a 3.5x3.2x0.6cm. pink tan ulcerated exophytic polypoid mass located 6.8cm. from the wide margin and 11.0cm. from the narrower margin. Remaining colonic mucosa is pink tan and smooth with a single diverticulum located 2.5cm. from the narrow margin. The tumor is noted to extend into the fat but not to the peritoneal surface. The radial margin of. resection is free of any lesion. The peritoneal surface of the tumor and the margins are marked by black ink. No discrete nodule lesion is identified in the pericolic fat. Multiple small lymph nodes are. identified ranging in size from < 0.1cm to 1.0cm. Representative tissue is submitted in nineteen cassettes as follows: A1: 4.5cm. shaved margin A2: 5.0cm. shaved margin A3: mass with deep margin A4: mass A5: mass with lymph nodes and fatty tissue

A6: one lymph node and deep fatty tissue contiguous with A5 A7-A8: mass A9: diverticulum A10: radial margin. A11: uninvolved colonic mucosa A12: five peritumoral lymph nodes A13; four peritumoral lymph nodes A14: two possible peritumoral lymph nodes A15: two possible peritumoral lymph nodes A16: five lymph nodes at narrow margin A17: four possible lymph nodes at narrow margin. A18: two lymph nodes at wide margin A19: one lymph node bisected at wide margin. B. PROXIMAL DONUT Received without fixative is a ring shaped 1.5x1.5x0.7cm. fragment of smooth, stapled colonic mucosa. with slight, focal pink red discoloration. The stapled part is removed and representative tissue is submitted in one cassette. C.DISTAL DONUT Received without fixative is a 1.5x1.5x1.0cm. ring shaped fragment of colonic mucosa with multiple. staples. The mucosa is tan, smooth with no discrete lesion. The stapled part is removed and the. remaining fragment of tissue is submitted in one cassette.
