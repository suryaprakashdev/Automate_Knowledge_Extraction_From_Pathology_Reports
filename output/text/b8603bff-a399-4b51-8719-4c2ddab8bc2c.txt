SURGICAL PATHOLOGY MEDICAL RECORD SURGICAL PATHOLOGY PATHOLOGY REPORT Laboratory: Accession No. Submitted by: Date obtained: rd-6-3 Specimen (Received A.BASE OF LEFT RENAL TUMOR F.S Site O Biny N&5 Ci4.9 B.LEFT RENAL PERITUMOR FAT 1129|13 C.LEFT RENAL TUMOR BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY: UUID:465C49A8-2050-434A-AC95-9144E46972DB TCGA-MH-A857-01A-PR PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Redacted left renal mass OPERATIVE FINDINGS: POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: left renal mass Surgeon/physician: PATHOLOGY REPORT Laboratory: Accession No. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and consists of a 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan-yellow irregular tissue fragment that is submitted in toto for frozen and permanent section in cassette FsA. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: FsA. Base of left renal tumor, biopsy: - NO TUMOR SEEN B. The specimen consists of a 173 gm, 11.2 x 6.5 x 3.2 cm tan-yellow aggregate of fatty soft tissue partially surfaced by a tan-pink smooth glistening peritoneal surface. No discrete lesions are identified. Sectioning reveals a tan-yellow unremarkable fatty cut surface. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes Bl-B6. C. The specimen consists of a 54.7 gm, 5.5 x 5.2 x 3.8 cm partial nephrectomy specimen partially surfaced by a tan-brown scabrous renal resection margin. The capsular margin is partially surfaced by tan yellow lobulated fat. The renal resection margin is inked blue and the capsular margin is inked black.

The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 4.6 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm tan-yellow to brown to red variegated poorly demarcated mass that grossly extends less than 1 mm from the renal resection margin and 0.4 cm from the overlying Gerota's fascia/capsular margin. There is a minimal amount of uninvolved renal parenchyma at the renal resection margin. Representative sections of the majority of the mass, to include the. capsular and renal resection margins, are submitted sequentially in. cassettes C1-c17. (Please note that a representative portion is taken for MICROSCOPIC EXAM DIAGNOSIS: A. Base of left renal tumor, excision: - NO TUMOR IDENTIFIED B.
