There is an ill defined ulcerated brown-tan tumor involving the lateral surface of the tongue. The tumor measures 2.5 SI x 1.0 ML x 3.3 AP cm. It is located at 0.3 cm from the deep soft tissue margin, 1.3 cm away cm from the medial/superior tongue margin, 1.7 cm from the anterior tongue margin, 1.7 from the posterior tongue margin and is 0.8 cm away from the inferior floor of mouth margin. The remaining tongue mucosa is grossly unremarkable. The deep/medial soft tissue margin is painted with India ink and the posterior margin is painted with green dye. A representative section of the tumor including deep soft tissue margin is examined at intraoperative consultation.
