TCGA-P4-AAVO-01A-PR Redacted Tissue Source Site (Tss) #: Patholgy Accession No: Patient ID: Normal Sample ID: IcD-O3 Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS 8QO|3 (A) RIGHT COLON: C44.9 Colon with tubular adenomas (x3, ranging from 0.3 cm to 2.2 cm) and sessile serrated adenoma (1.4 cm). Qs5/4lJ4y No high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma in colon.. Unremarkable non-neoplastic colonic mucosa. Vermiform appendix with small hyperplastic polyp. Terminal ileum, no tumor present. Fourteen lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/14). (B) RIGHT KIDNEY, PARA CAVAL LYMPH NODES: PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (4.5 X 4.0 X 3.5 CM), TYPE 2, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. (SEE COMMENT) Margins of resection free of tumor. COMMENT The renal cell carcinoma is composed of papillae and nests lined by cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical stains for P504S and vimentin are strongly positive in the tumor cells. CD10 is positive with a membranous staining pattern. Cytokeratin 7 is positive in rare cells. The morphologic features and immunohistochemical profile are consistent with a type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma. The right colon specimen has been reviewed by The above diagnosis is. based on her interpretation. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT COLON - A right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of segment of large bowel (30.0 cm in length and 10 cm. circumference), attached segment of small bowel (6.0 cm in length and 4.0 cm circumference), and appendix (4.5 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm). There are five polypoid lesions identified. The largest (2.2 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm) is a sessile colonic polyp located 13.0 cm from the distal margin and 17.0 cm from the ileocecal valve. The polyp is superficial..  There is a second polyp (1.4 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm) in the colon located 5.0 cm from the ileocecal valve and 12.0 cm proximal to the 2.2 cm polyp. The polyp is also superficial. There is a third colonic polyp (0.4 cm in greatest dimension) located 4.0 cm from the distal margin and 8.0 cm distal to the. 2.2 cm polyp. The cecum shows two small polypoid lesions. The first (0.6 cm in greatest dimension) is superficial and is 6.0 cm from the ileocecal valve. The second (0.3 cm in greatest dimension) is also superficial and 3.0 cm from the ileocecal valve. No invasive tumor is identified. The surrounding colonic mucosa is unremarkable. The small bowel mucosa and. appendix are both unremarkable. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified in the surrounding adipose tissue.. SECTION CODE: A1, representative appendix; A2, proximal and distal margins; A3, normal small and large bowel mucosa; A4, 0.6 cm cecal polyp; A5, 0.3 cm cecal polyp; A6, 0.4 cm colonic polyp; A7, A8, 1.4 cm colonic polyp; A9-A14, 2.2 cm colonic polyp; A15, six possible lymph nodes; A16, six possible nodes; A17, six possible nodes; A18, four possible nodes; A19, one possible node, serially sectioned (possibly vessel).. (B) RIGHT KIDNEY, PARA CAVAL LYMPH NODES - A radical nephrectomy specimen (15.0 x 11.0 x 4.0 cm), including a kidney (12.0 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm), segment of renal artery (1.0 x 0.4 cm), renal vein (1.0 cm x 0.7 cm) and ureter (10.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in average diameter). There is no adrenal identified. There is no lymph node identified. There is well-circumscribed firm tumor (4.5 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm) in the lower pole of the kidney. The tumor is gray-tan with small area of hemorrhage (less than 5%). There is no necrosis identified in the tumor. The tumor is confined to the kidney. The tumor does not invade into perinephric adipose tissue and does not extend to Gerota's fascia. The tumor is pushing the renal sinus adipose tissue but does not invade into the renal sinus adipose tissue.. The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. Pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesion. Lymph nodes are not identified..
