The specimen is serially. sectioned and a touch prep is taken. Toto A1. B. SENTINEL NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's identification and 'sentinel. node #2 right axilla' are two tan pink lymph nodes 2 x 1.2 x 0.7cm and 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.3cm. The specimens are serially sectioned and two touch preps are taken.. B1: one lymph node. B2: one lymph node C. RIGHT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast' is a 160g, 15 x 14 x 3.5cm oriented (stitch in axilla) simple mastectomy with attached 8 x 3cm tan brown. skin ellipse and O.9cm everted nipple.
