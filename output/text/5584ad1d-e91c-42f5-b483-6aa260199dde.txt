FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued) : ** Report slogtronicallv Siqned Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: -year-old white female with T2mxnx right breast cancer. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer.. GROSS DESCRIpTION: A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 BIOPsy" is a single lymph node P, measuring 1.6 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm with an attached portion of fat. A portion of the lymph node is submitted for cBcp protocol.~The remaining tissue is submitted for microscopic examination. One cassette, none saved. B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2" consists of a white/tan, somewhat fibrous tissue fragment consistent with a lymph node. Sectioning reveals a dense, white, fibrous nodule located within the specimen measuring 0.8 cm in its greatest dimension. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified. Entirely submitted. One cassette, none saved.. C. Receiued in formalin, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3" consists of a tan/orown, irreguiarly shaped tissue fragment measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. Sectioning reveals a tan/brown, unremarkable cut surface. Entirely submitted. Two cassettes, some saved. D. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "RIgHT BREAsT" is an 883.0 gram total mastectomy specimen, measuring 22.0 cm from the superior to inferior margin, 20.5 cm from the medial to the lateral, and 4.7 cm from the posterior margin. The overlying ellipse of nipple bearing skin measuring 4.6 x 4.2 cm and is without obvious scars or other abnormalities. An ink code is as follows: Blue-superior to anterior margin, green-inferior anterior margin, black-posterior margin. Sectioning reveals a well-defined, firm, tan tumor, measuring 4.0 x 3.2 x 2.5 cm in the mid anterior - left upper quadrant, approximately 1.5 cm from the deep margin. The remaining is mostly fatty with patches of white, fibrous tissue especially J tissue inferiorly. Multiple sections are submitted for the CBcp protocol.. Paraffin sections as follows: Page 2 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 Continued on Next Page.
