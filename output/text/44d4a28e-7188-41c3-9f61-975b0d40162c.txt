RIGHT BREAST INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: TPA, Lymph node, sentinel, right axilla, biopsy: Negative for carcinoma. TPB, Lymph node, sentinel, right axilla, biopsy: Negative for carcinoma. TPC, Lymph node, sentinel, right axilla, biopsy: Negative for carcinoma TPD, Lymph node, sentinel. right axilla, biopsy: Negative for carcinoma Diagnoses called at by Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SLN 1 RIGHT AXILLA  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "sentinel lymph node number one right axilla" is a tan lymph node measuring 2.2 x 1 x 0.8 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely submitted, A1. B. SLN 2 RIGHT AXILLA  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "sentinel lymph node number two right axilla" is a tan lymph node measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely submitted, B1. C. SLN 3 RIGHT AXILLA  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "sentinel lymph node number three right axilla" is a tan lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely submitted, C1.. D. SLN 4 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "sentinel lymph node number four right axilla" is a tan lymph node measuring 1 x 0.6 x 0:4 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely submitted, D1. E. RIGHT BREAST  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "right breast"' is an oriented, 27 g, 5.3 x 4.5 x 3 cm lumpectomy specimen. The short suture designates superior, long-lateral. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-  black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to.  inferior into 5 slices to reveal a firm lobulated tan mass, 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm, located 0.1-cm from the nearest anterior margin. The entire specimen is submitted:. E1-E3: Perpendicular sections superior margin. E4-E7: Slice 2, E5 demonstrating mass and nearest anterior margin E8-E11: Slice 3, E9, E11 demonstrating mass and nearest anterior margin. E12-E15: Stice 4, submitted entirely E16-E18: Perpendicular sections inferior margin DIAGNOSIS: A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:E - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1), MEASURING 0.3-CM WITH EXTRANODAL EXTENSION, SEE NOTE. B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1). MEASURING 0.1-CM WITH EXTRANODAL EXTENSION, SEE NOTE C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1). D. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #4, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1), MEASURING 0.6-CM WITH EXTRANODAL EXTENSION, SEE NOTE.

E. BREAST, RIGHT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 1.9-CM - INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID TYPE - INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT 0.15-CM FROM MEDIAL AND 0.1-CM FROM ANTERIOR SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS - FOCAL LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED - BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS, - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE NOTE: The touch preparation of SLN #1 and 2 shows no tumor cells. Therefore the false negativity is due to sampling error. The touch preparation of SLN #4 shows two clusters of atypical cells. Dr. concurs. A few clusters branching out and focally separated from the main tumor mass are identified in a close proximity to  the medial margin (0.15-cm). The main tumor mass is 0.1-cm from the anterior surgical resection margin.
