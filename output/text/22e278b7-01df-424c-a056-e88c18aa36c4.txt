Synoptic Data Specimen Type:e Resection:Near total glossectomy. Tumor Site: Tongue Histologic Type:. Squamous cell carcinoma, conventional Tumor Size: Greatest dimension: 6.5 cm Tumor thickness: 2.2 cm Histologic Grade: G2: Moderately differentiated Venous/Lymphatic (Large/Small Vessel) Invasion (V/L): Absent Perineural Invasion: Absent Additional Pathologic Findings:. Carcinoma in situ Margins: Margin(s) involved by tumor Location(s): infero-anterior Pathotogic Staging (pTNM): pT3: Tumor or lip or oral cavity more than 4 cm in greatest dimension pN2c: Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension for all aerodigestive sites except nasopharynx Number of regional lymph nodes examined: 55 Number of regional lymph nodes involved: 9 Extra-capsular extension of nodal tumor: Absent. pMX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed Comment All nine positive lymph nodes in the bilateral neck dissection contain micrometastases only. The size of the largest node in each neck is based on the node size and not the size of the metastasis. Page 2 of 4
