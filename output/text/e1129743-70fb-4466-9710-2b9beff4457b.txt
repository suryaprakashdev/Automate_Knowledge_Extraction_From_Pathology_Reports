Left axillary sentinel lymph nodes 8. Left breast - short stitch superior MSARAMERRPRSPECIMENDATA GROSS DESCRIPTION: A.Container A is labelec Received in formalin, is a 3.0 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm slightly blue-dyed tan lymph node. The specimen is sectloned and submitted in cassettes A1-A2 labeled 8. Container B is labeled :eft breast. Received in formalin, is a 1,044 gram, 23.0 x t7.5 x 5.0 cm left simple mastectomy surfaced on one. aspect by a 20.0 x 11.2 cm ellipse ot tan-white skin with a low-central 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm nipple which exudes no discharge. Surrounding tha nipple, there is a 6.0 cm diameter patch of intense blue-dyed discoloration. The specimen is oriented with a suture at the mid aspect of one long axis Indicating. supsrior. The deep aspect of the specimen has been previously sectioned for cotlection of tissue for genomics studies. At the previous incision site, the cut surfaces give rise to a subareolar, 11.0 x 10.0 x 8.0 cm indurated, wellcircumscribed, focally cystic and mucinous tumor. The tumor is 3.5 cm from. the nearest deep margin and 3.2 cm from the nearest skin resection margin. The remaining breast parenchyma is 20% fibrous tissue. There are no. lymph nodes near the upper outer quadrant. n studies labeied and. tepresentative sections of the remaining tissue are submitted in cassettes labeled 3s followa: B1 representative nippie; B2-87 representative tumor, B8-B9 representative uninvoived upper outer quadrant; B10-B11 representative of upper inner quadrant, B12-B13 representative of fower inner quadrant: 814-B15 representative of lowel. outer quadrant.
