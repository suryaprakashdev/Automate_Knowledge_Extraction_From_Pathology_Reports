B3: one lymph node B4: one lymph node B5: one lymph node C. ADDITIONAL AXILLARY TISSUE RIGHT AXILLA Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patients name and designated "additional axillary tissue" is a 1.7 x 1 x 0.2 cm fragment of soft fatty tissue. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted. DIAGNOSIS: A. BREAST, RIGHT, PARTIAL MASTECTOMY: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA WITH LYMPHOPLASMACYTIC INFILTRATE AND GEOGRAPHIC NECROSIS, SBR GRADE 3, MEASURING 1.1-CM - SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR - BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS AND FAT NECROSIS - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT. B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - FOUR LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/4). C. ADDITIONAL AXILLARY TISSUE, RIGHT, AXILLARY DISSECTION: - FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NO TUMOR OR LYMPHOID TISSUE IDENTIFIED. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST Specimen Type: Partial mastectomy Needle Localization:  No Laterality:  Right Invasive Tumor: Present Multifocality: No WHO CLASSIFICATION Invasive ductal carcinoma, NOs 8500/3 Tumor size: 1.1cm Tumor Site: Upper outer quadrant Margins: Negative Distance from closest margin: 0.3cm anterior Tubular Score: 3 Nuclear Grade: 3 Mitotic Score: 2.

ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number:  A2 ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 -- Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11- 30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 - weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 - strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer s. instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: A2 Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL Intensity: 2+ % Tumor Staining: 10% Fish Ordered: Yes METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved HercepTest (TM) test kit ising rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,  information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the  joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.

ADDENDUM: FISH/ISH ANALYSIS REPORT 3 Specimens Involved Specimens: A: RIGHT BREAST PARTIAL MASTECTOMY HER2/NEU RESULTS ANALYTICAL INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical interpretation of the results A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17 centimeter signals and 2 HER2 signals, with a HER2/CEP 17 Ratio 1.3, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Probes identification LSI Her-2/neu 17q11.2-12, spectrumorange CEP 17, 17 p11.1-q11.1 alpha satellite DNA, spectrumgreen Image analysis method - Manual Results interpreted Yes ISCN nuc ish: (CEP17,HER2)x2[200] Number of invasive tumor cells counted 200 Number of observers  Number of Her2 signals/nucleus 2.3  Number of CEP 17 signals/nucleus 1.8 Her2/CEP 17 ratio 1.3 TEST CHARACTERISTICS: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the Pathology Core Facility, Department of Pathology, under the direction of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis. The PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved Iymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu gene amplification status alone.
