Rule out breast CA. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Left breast biopsy", in formalin. Received is a portion of adipose. tissue which measures 4.5 x 4.0 x 1.9 cm in greatest dimensions. A firm nodule is felt within the adipose tissue. Sections through this nodule reveal greatest dimensions. The tumor approaches the margin of resection. Frozen section was done on this tumor. Initially, the tissue is submitted for ER/PR receptors.  The frozen section remnant is submitted in Block Al. Additional representative sections of tumor are submitted in Blocks A2 and A3. B. "Left breast with axillary contents". Received is a 620 gram, 20 x 16 x 3.5 cm modified radical mastectomy with attached axillary tail. The attached axillary tail measures 8 cm x 7.5 cm x 1.8 cm. The skin ellipse measures 20 cm in length x 7.5 cm in width with a medially eccentrically placed nipple. Lateral and inferior to the nipple is a 5 cm sutured incision. The deep. surface is painted with blue ink. Deep to the incision there is a hemorrhagic biopsy cavity which measures approximately 5 cm x 4.5 cm x 3 cm in greatest dimensions.  The biopsy cavity approaches the deep margin of the specimen, but. no residual tumor is identified. Along the superficial edge of the biopsy cavity is a residual firm nodule which measures 1.5 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm is felt. Examination of the remainder of the breast reveals only firm, white breast tissue and adipose tissue. The axillary tail is examined for lymph node candidates. Block Summary: B1: Representative sections of nipple.. B2: Representative sections of skin through incision. B3-B5: Representative sections of biopsy cavity to include deep margins. b6,b7: Nodule along superior aspect of biopsy cavity. B8: Representative section of upper inner quadrant. b9: Representative sections of lower inner quadrant. B10: Representative section of upper outer quadrant. B11: Representative section of normal lower outer quadrant. B12,B13: Lymph node candidates from Level-I. B14-B16: Lymph node candidates from Level-II (a single large lymph node candidate is bisected and submitted in toto in Block A16). B17,B18: Lymph node candidates from Level-III.
