GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "RIght BREAsT" is a 980 gram simple mastectomy specimen measuring 23.5 cm superior to inferior, 18.0 cm medial to lateral, and 5.1. cm anterior to posterior. The overyling ellipse of nipple bearing skin measures 7.4 x 3.8 cm, and is without gross abnormalities. Ink code: blue-superior/anterior, green-inferior/anterior, and black-posterior. Sectioning reveals a 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm stellate tumor with a tan, gritty,. and focally hemorrhagic cut surface in the lower outer quadrant, 2.0 cm from the deep margin, and 2.5 cm from the inferior/anterior margin. The remaining tissue is mostly fatty with interspersed lengths of soft, white, parenchyma. Multiple tissue sections are submitted for cBcp protocol with. matching paraffin sections in cassette Al, A2, A3, and A7. Slide key: Al: Skin. A2: Tumor. A3: Tumor. A4-A6: Margins nearest tumor. A7: Fibrosis (central). A8: Nipple.. A9: Upper inner quadrant. Al0: Lower inner quadrant. All: Lower outer quadrant. A12: Upper outer quadrant. 12CF B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "ADDITIONAL RIGHT BREAST TISSUE" are two fragments of tan-yellow, fibrofatty, non-oriented, soft tissue. The larger measures 11.0 x 9.5 x 3.5 cm. The smaller measures 7.5 x 7.0 x 3.8 cm. The outer portion of both specimens is inked entirely in black. Sectioning reveals a uniform, glistening, yellow, lobular cut surface admixed with a scant portion of white, fibrous appearing connective tissue.. Representative. sections are submitted.

The surface appears to be muscle grossly. Sectioning reveals a white, fibrous appearing band 0.3 cm thick, running the length of the center of the specimen parallel to the deep margin. The specimen is inked deep in black, superior in yellow, and inferior in green. The specimen is entirely submitted lateral to medial. Slide key:. c1: Inferior portion of section 1.0 cm from the lateral margin contiguous with c5.. c2: Inferior portion of section submitted for frozen contiguous with C10. 14CF D. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFr BReAsT" is a 984 gram simple mastectomy specimen. specimen measures 26.0 cm superior to inferior, 18.0 cm medial to lateral,.  The and 5.8 cm anterior to posterior. The overlying ellipse of nipple bearing. skin measures 7.2 x 3.5 cm, and is notable for an inverted nipple. Ink code: blue-superior/anterior, green-inferior/anterior, and black-posterior.  Sectioning reveals a 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm tumor with stellate margins, and tan, gritty, hemorrhagic cut surface in the lower outer quadrant abutting the deep margin. The remaining tissue is mostly. fatty with interspersed widths of soft, white parenchyma. Multiple tissue. sections are submitted for cbcp protocol with matching paraffin sections in cassettes D1, D4, and D5. Slide key:. D1: Skin (medial tip). D2-D4: Tumor with margin. D5: Fibrous, upper outer quadrant, 5.0 cm from tumor. D6-D8: Remaining lateral portion of tumor including deep black inked margin. D9: Two sections of nipple.
