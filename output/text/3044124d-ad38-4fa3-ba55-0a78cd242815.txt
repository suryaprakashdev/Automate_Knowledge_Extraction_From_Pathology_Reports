Ultrasound revealed 12 mm x 15 mm 9 mm lesion.. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: A-excisional biopsy left breast needle localized: Lesion identified 0.5 cm (gross) from superior margin. Diagnosis called by Dr. to Dr. DIAGNOSIS: A. BREAST, LEFT, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - MULTIFOCAL INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, NOTTINGHAM GRADE 2. - 1.7 CM AND 0.1 CM IN SIZE. - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), MICROPAPILLARY TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE 2, WITH MICROCALCIFICATIONS, MINOR COMPONENT. - LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS), PLEOMORPHIC AND CLASSIC TYPES. - MARGINS, NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA, DCIS, AND PLEOMORPHIC LCIS. - VESSELS WITH MICROCALCIFICATIONS.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. EXCISIONAL BIOPSY LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZED Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "excisional biopsy left breast. needle localized" is a previously inked, oriented (single stitch-anterior, double stitch- lateral, triple stitch-superior) 54 g, 3.1 x 3 x 2.9 cm needle localized excision with radiographs. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-right, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 7 slices revealing a 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm firm tan stellate mass that is closest to the superior margin at 0.5 cm and a biopsy clip in slice 3. Tissue is procured; representatively submitted as per the attached diagram (time placed in formalin): A1: perpendicular sections of lateral margin A2: slice 2, mid section A3: slice 3, anterior superior with mass A4: slice 4, anterior superior with mass A5: slice 4, posterior superior with mass A6: slice 4, anterior inferior A7: slice 4, mid inferior A8: slice 4, posterior inferior A9: slice 5, mid superior A10: slice 5, posterior superior A11: slice 5, mid section A12: slice 5, mid inferior A13: slice 6, anterior superior A14: slice 6, anterior inferior A15: perpendicular sections of medial margin B. SLN #1 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with patient's identification and "SLN #1 left axilla" is a piece of yellow-tan soft tissue, 6.2 x 3.1 x 1.2 cm containing 4 lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 1 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The lymph nodes are sectioned and submitted entirely. and separately in B1-B4. C. SLN #2 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "SLN #2 left axilla" is a 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm lymph node. It is sectioned and submitted entirely in C1
