Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis: Frozen section was requested by FsAl: Vagina, posterior, biopsy - Squamous lined fibrous nodule - No carcinoma identified Frozen Section Pathologist: Clinical History: rectal moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, also. tubulovillous adenoma in cecum Gross Description: Specimen A was received fresh for frozen section, labeled "posterior vaginal mucosa nodule for frozen section" and consists of a 1.5 x 0.7 cm red/tan soft tissue fragment. The specimen is bisected and submitted for frozen section. in block FSA1, NTR. Specimen B is received in a formalin-filled container. labeled "left ovary" and consists of a 21.3 gram, 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.3 cm multicystic

ovary. The external surface is thin, smooth and almost translucent pale tan. The cut surface shows cystic multicystic structures filled with clear serous fluid. There is a small amount of fallopian tube which. measures 2.5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in cross. sectional diameter. Representative sections of ovary and tube are submitted in. blocks B1 and B2.. Specimen c is received in a formalin-filled container labeled "right ovary" and consists of a 33.0 gm, 5.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm multicystic ovary. The external surface of the ovary shows a large translucent cystic structure. The ovary. is bivalved to reveal a cystic structure filled with clear. serous fluid. There is a small seqment of fallopian tube, which measures 2.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in cross sectional diameter. Representative sections of ovary. and tube are submitted in blocks c1 and c2. Specimen D:. Specimen fixation: Formalin. Parts of bowel received: Distal sigmoid colon and rectum. with a portion of perianal skin Specimen length: 26.0 cm and up to 6.0 cm in open. circumference Orientation: Inking: proximal/green, stitch marking distal anterior/red, bowel length/yellow Tumor location: Distal anterior Gross appearance of tumor: There is a superficial granular. fungating area, which measures 3.0 x 3.0 cm. In the center of this area is a surgical defect where probable tissue procurement occurred in the operating room. This defect is inked with blue ink.. Tumor dimensions: 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.5 cm. Circumferential growth: Approximately 50% of luminal circumference involved.

Gross depth of invasion: Tumor grossly appears to invade the submucosa but not through the muscularis propria. Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: No Luminal obstruction: None Bowel circumference at tumor site: 6.0 cm Gross distance of tumor from margins: 2.0 cm from distal and 20.5 cm from proximal Lymph nodes: 21 lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm in maximum dimension. Other remarkable findings: In the central area there is a small 3mm polyp which is 12 cm from the distal end and 12. cm from the proximal end. Tissue submitted for special investigation: Tumor was taken by Dr.in the OR for tissue procurement facility and normal tissue was banked in the gross room for tissue procurement facility.

D26 - Three lymph node candidates. D27 - Two lymph node candidates. D28 - Two lymph node candidates Specimen E:. Specimen fixation: Formalin. Parts of bowel received: Terminal ileum and proximal right. colon Specimen length: 25.0 cm, 12.0 cm is terminal ileum and 12.0 cm is right colon. Orientation: Inking: terminal ileum resection margin/blue,. right colon resection margin/black, inner external surface is green beneath the polyp. Tumor location: There is a pedunculated polyp in the cecum,. which measures 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Two tan/brown granular flat polyps in the right colon, which measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm and 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.1 cm. There is a 4th slightly raised polyp in the right colon, which measures 0.4 cm in diameter. Gross appearance of tumor: See above.. Tumor dimensions: There is a pedunculated polyp in the. cecum, which measures 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Two tan/brown granular. flat polyps in the.. right colon, which measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm and 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.1 cm. There is a 4th slightly raised polyp in the right colon, which. measures 0.4 cm in diameter. See above. Circumferential growth: Approximately 10% of luminal circumference involved.

Gross depth of invasion: Tumor does not invade the submucosa and is primarily superficial. Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: No Luminal obstruction: None Bowel circumference at tumor site: 10.5 cm. Gross distance of tumor from margins: The polyp in the cecum is 10 cm from the colon and 13.5 cm from the terminal ileum. The closest flat polyp is. 6.7 cm from the right colon margin and the other flat polyp is 15.0 cm from the. terminal ileum margin. The smallest slightly raised polyp is 2.0 cm from the. right colon margin. Lymph nodes: 15 lymph nodes, ranging from 1 x 1 x 1 mm to 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm in maximum dimension.. Other remarkable findings: The appendix is attached and appears grossly unremarkable and measures 6.0 cm in length and up to 0.8 cm from cross. sectional diameter. There is also a blue discoloration at the right colon margin which is 1.0 cm from the margin. This area is either possible tattooing or submucosal hemorrhage. Both of these areas are submitted (E12-E14). Tissue submitted for special investigation: none. Digital photograph taken: no. Block Summary: Inking: terminal ileum resection margin/blue, right colon resection margin/black, inner external surface is green beneath the polyp
