Few signet ring cells are noted in both the in situ and invasive tumor.. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) FOR IMMEDIATE INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION AND X-RAY IMAGING LABELED LEFT SEGMENTAL MASTECTQMY, SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR, LONG STITCH LATERAL, PURPLE iS DEEP - A breast tissue with needle localization wires measuring 10.0 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm. Surgical margins are inked. The specimen is radiographed before and after slicing and the radiograph is reviewed by the radiologist. The specimen is sectioned from lateral to medial aspect into seven slices. Slice 3 contains an ill-defined, firm tan lesion #1 containing radiological clip. It measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. It is more than 1.0 cm from all the margins. Cut surface of slices 4 and 5 contains a second ill-defined indurated tan lesion with clip measuring 2.0 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm. It is 0.4 cm from the closest anterior surgical margin. Cut surface of slice 5 and 6 shows an ill-defined lesion 3. with clip measuring 1.9 x 1.6 x 1.3 cm. In slice 5, lesion 3 and 2 are grossly connected to each other. Lesion 3 is 0.5 cm away. from the medial surgical margin, 0.2cm from deep margin and more than 1.0 cm from the rest of the margins. Located in fatty. tissue at the inferior aspect of slices 1 and 2 are two possible lymph nodes ranging from 1.1 up to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension which are indicated by the surgeon to represent the sentinel lymph nodes. Lymph nodes identified in slice 1 is sent for protocol Representative sections are submitted. A portion of the tumor is given to tumor bank. INK CODE: Superior - blue; inferior - green; anterior - yellow; posterior - black; lateral and medial -red.
