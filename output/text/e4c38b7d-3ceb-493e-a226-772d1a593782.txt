Page 2 of 3 Non-Neoplastic Bowel: Unremarkable Lymph Nodes: Number with metastasis: 1 Total number examined: 17 Tumor c deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue: Not Identified Tumor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition) : pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues) Lymph Node Stage (AJcc 7th Edition): Nla (Metastasis in one regional lymph node). Rectum, distal ring; excision: - Benign segment of rectum with no pathologic diagnosis.. 3. Colon, proximal ring; excision: - Benign segment of colon with no pathologic diagnosis.. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT.S Gross Description: 1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "sigmoid and upper rectum, open end is proximal". It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 19 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is pink and glistening. The. radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 12 cm from the proximal margin and 5.5 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 2 cm in length and 1.5 cm in width. Serial. sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 0.6 cm, which is 2.5 cm from. the closest radial margin. The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable. Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph. nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. Tps is submitted. The specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection. Summary of sections: PM - proximal margin DM -  distal margin RM - radial margin T - tumor U - uninvolved mucosa LN - lymph nodes BLN  - bisected lymph node ** Continued on next page **

 Page 3 of 3 2. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal ring" and consists of a ring of bowel measuring 1.0 cm in length and 1.5 cm in diameter. It has a stapled line through the middle. The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and smooth. The staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U - undesignated 3. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal ring" and consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 5.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. At the center of the pin, a blue plastic piece is noted.  A ring of pink tan soft tissue is attached measuring 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and smooth. Several sutures are noted. The sutures are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.
