THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 7.5 X 4.2 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. BLUE DYE IS NOTED IN THE SUPERIOR 12 O'CLOCK AREA OF THE BREAST. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP WITH BLACK. AN M CLIP IS IDENTIFIED IN THE UPPER INNER QUADRANT MEDIAL ASPECT, ASSOCIATED WITH A PINK-TAN NODULE AT THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN MEASURING O.9 X O.5 X 1.2 CM. THIS IS 1.3 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN, 1 CM FROM THIS IS A 0.3 CM FIRM GRAY-TAN AREA WHICH IS 1 CM FROM THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN AND 1.1 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN GROSSLY. ELONGATED IRREGULAR PINK-TAN FIRM AREA WHICH ALSO EXTENDS GROSSLY TO THE  IN THE 11 O'CLOCK AREA THERE IS AN SUPERFICIAL MARGIN. THIS MEASURES 3.5 X 0.9 AND IS 1.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. THIS LESION IS GROSSLY 3 CM FROM THE FIRST DESCRIBED LESION. THIS LESION GROSSLY EXTENDS TOWARDS THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN AND IS 1.2 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. THE BREAST TISSUE ITSELF HAS AN OVERALL INDURATED QUALITY TO PALPATION WITH A DIFFUSE YELLOW-GRAY APPEARANCE. THE INFERIOR AND LATERAL ASPECTS DEMONSTRATE A MORE FATTY APPEARANCE. ALSO IN THE AREA OF THE UPPER INNER QUADRANT, THE PARENCHYMA HAS MULTIPLE SMALL PALPABLE LESIONS. THIS IS IN THE AREA OF THE BLUE DYE. IT IS SECTIONED TO DEMONSTRATE THIS WHICH IS SLIGHTLY INFERIOR AND TOWARD THE NIPPLE FROMS THE SECOND DESCRIBED LESION SUBMITTED IN A1O (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL).
