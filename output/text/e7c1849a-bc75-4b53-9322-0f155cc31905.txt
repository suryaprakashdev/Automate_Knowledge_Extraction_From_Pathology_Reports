TUMOR SIZE: 7x5x1.2 CM - MARGINS OF RESECTION, NO TUMOR SEEN. - TWENTY THREE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASIS (0/23) 2) MULTIPLE TUBULAR ADENOMAS AND HYPERPLASTIC POLYPS OF ASCENDING COLON COLORECTAL CANCER TEMPLATE Tumor Size (cm): 7x5x1.2 cm. Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma Grade/Differentiation: Grade 3 with medullary features. Invasion Depth: Subserosa  Invasion Vasc/Lymphatic: Absent Invasion Perineural: Absent Extension to Adj. Areas: NA Margins: Free Lymph Nodes: Negative (0/23) Stage Pathology: pT3N0 MX Implants: Absent Precursor:  Present, tubular adenomas and hyperplastic polyps Non-neoplastic areas:. NA SPECIMEN(S): A. RIGHT COLON TERMINAL ILEUM CLINICAL HISTORY: NA GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT COLON, TERMINAL ILEUM Received fresh and subsequently fixed with matching patient name and requisition number is a 30cm right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of a 5cm in length, 2cm in circumference terminal ileum segment and 25cm in length, 6cm average circumference right colon with moderate amount of pericolonic fat and surgically absent appendix. There is a 7x5x1.2cm light tan fungating tumor mass Iocated in the proximal cecum, 2.5cm from the ileocecal valve, 7cm from the proximal and 17cm from. the distal margin. Cut section of the tumor shows it is penetrating the muscularis propria and focally extending into the subserosal fat. Tumor tissue has been procured. There are multiple flat sessile polypoid lesions scattered in the right colon, ranging from 0.2cm in greatest dimension to 1.0x0.7x0.5cm. The most distal one is more than 1cm away from the distal surgical margin. The uninvolved colonic mucosa as well as the terminal ileum have kept its normal rugosity and are grossly. unremarkable. The mesenteric fat is thoroughly dissected and all Iymph nodes are submitted for microscopic examination. Representative sections are taken as follows:. A1-A7: representatives of the tumor A8: three polypoid lesions. A9: one polypoid lesion, bisected. A10-A11: one polypoid lesion, serially sectioned A12: four polypoid lesions A13: the most distal polyp A14: representatives of the uninvolved colonic mucosa A15: distal surgical margin. A16: proximal surgical margin and uninvolved terminal ileum A17: 6 presumptive lymph nodes. A18: 2 bisected lymph nodes, one inked black A19: 2 lymph nodes, larger one bisected. A20: 2 bisected lymph nodes, one is black.

 A21: 2 bisected lymph nodes, larger is grossly positive A22: 1 lymph node, serially sectioned A23: 3 presumptive lymph nodes A24: 1 bisected lymph node A25: 1 bisected lymph node A26: 2 bisected lymph nodes, 1 inked black A27: 2 lymph nodes
