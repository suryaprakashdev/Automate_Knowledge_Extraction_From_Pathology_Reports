(Gross examination only) Synoptic Data Specimen Type: Resection:contents right neck, left neck, mandibulectomy, and intra-oral resection right. floor of mouth.. Tumor Site: Oral Cavity Histologic Type: Squamous cell carcinoma, conventional. Tumor Size: Greatest dimension: 7.0 cm Histologic Grade:. G3: Poorly differentiated Venous/Lymphatic (Large/Small Vessel) Invasion (V/L): Absent Perineural Invasion:. Present Margins: Margins uninvolved by tumor Margins uninvolved by tumor - Distance of tumor from closest margin: 0.1 cm Margins: The tumor is close to lateral and medial (0.1 and 0.2 cm) soft tissue margins of the neck, and soft tissue margins of floor of mouth (0.3 cm). Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT4a: Oral cavity: Tumor invades adjacent structures (eg, through cortical bone,. into deep [extrinsic] muscle of tongue [genioglossus, hyoglossus, palatoglossus, and. styloglossus], maxillary sinus, skin of face). pN2c: Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in. greatest dimension for all aerodigestive sites except nasopharynx. : Number of regional lymph nodes examined: 56. ' Number of regional lymph nodes involved: 19 Extra-capsular extension of nodal tumor: Present. pMX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed Clinical History oral ca Gross Description. 1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and NCK: Contents right neck, left neck, mandibulectomy, intraoral resection right floor of mouth". It consists of a segment of mandible, with attached floor of mouth and bilateral neck dissections with overall measurements of 11.0 cm AP x 22.5 Sl x 10.0 ML cm. The portion of right mandible measures 6.0 cm AP x 2.5 cm SI x 3.0 cm ML. The lower alveolar ridge is edentulous. There is a tumor arising in the alveolar ridge. The tumor measures 5.5 AP x 7.0 SI x 4.7 ML cm. The tumor appears ulcerated and involves mandibular bone, floor of mouth and the adjacent right neck dissection, where it forms a large, partially necrotic mass, substantially replacing the right level I with extension into level Il. The tumor involves the right parotid and right submandibular glands. The tumor is Iocated at 0.1 cm from the closest right lateral soft tissue margin. The distance from the remaining margins to the tumor are as follows: anterior alveolar mucosa 1.0 cm, posterior alveolar mucosa 1.8 cm, right lateral alveolar mucosa 0.4 cm, anterior floor of mouth mucosa 0.8 cm, posterior floor of mouth mucosa 0.5 cm, medial floor of mouth mucosa 0.6 cm, right anterior soft tissue 1.3 cm, right posterior soft tissue 0.8 cm, medial soft tissue 0.2 cm and inferior to floor of mouth soft tissue 0.3 cm. The right neck dissection measures 9.0 cm AP by 15.3 cm Sl by 5.5 cm ML. and includes levels I, If, I, IV and V. The right submandibular gland measures 4.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm and is grossly involved by tumor. The right sternocleidomastoid muscle measures 10.3 x 4.0 x 2.8 cm and is adjacent to, but not grossly involved by tumor. The left neck dissection measures 5.5 cm AP by 17.3 cm SI by 2.5 cm ML and includes levels I, II, IlI and lV. The left submandibular gland measures 3.8 x 2.7 x 1.8 cm and is grossly unremarkable. The left sternocleidomastoid muscle is absent. Multiple lymph nodes are present in all levels, measuring from 0.2 to 5.0 cm in maximum dimension. Several Page 2 of 4
