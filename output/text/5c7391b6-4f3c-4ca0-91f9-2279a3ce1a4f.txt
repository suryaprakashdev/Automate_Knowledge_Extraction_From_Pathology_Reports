the specimen sectioned, showing a red-tan oval mass in the lateral aspect of the breast. This mass measures 7 cm greatest dimension. It grossly extends to within 0.5 cm of the superior margin of resection which is submitted in block 3, 0.7 cm of the inferior margin of resection which is submitted in block 4, and 1 cm of the deep margin of resection which is submitted in block 5. Additional sections of the mass are submitted in blocks 6-9. The remaining. breast is composed of yellow lobulated adipose tissue admixed with islands of gray-white rubbery tissue. The breast is divided into four quadrants, upper inner, lower inner, upper outer and lower 'outer and sampled in blocks 10-13'respectively.
