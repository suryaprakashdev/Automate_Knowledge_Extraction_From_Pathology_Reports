Page 2 of 12. LEFT COMMON ILIAC, BIOPSY: -Adipose tissue negative for malignancy Comment:  The tumor abuts the ectocervical-vaginal junction. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is not identified; however,. essentially the entire cervix has been replaced by squamous cell carcinoma. HISTORY:  Cervical carcinoma MICROSCOPIC: See Diagnosis. GROSS : 1: RIGHT ADNEXA Labeled "right adnexa" and received in formalin is an ovary with attached fallopian tube. The specimen weighs 13 grams. The ovary measures 3.7 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm and has firm yellow focally hemorrhagic mildly lobulated surface. Sectioning of the ovary reveals a corpus luteum measuring up to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension and also one smooth wall cyst filled with clear fluid and with a wall thickness up to 0.1 cm. The fallopian tube has fimbria at one end and is 3.7 cm long and has an average diameter of 0.7 cm. Attached to the fallopian tubes there are three thin wall translucent fluid filled cysts measuring from 0.1 to 0.2 cm in diameter. Sectioning of the tube reveal a patent lumen measuring up to o.1 cm in diameter. Representative sections submitted. A. Right ovary - 1 B.

Section reveals approximately eight cystic spaces ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.8 cm: The walls are smooth and have maximum thickness of 0.1 cm. The attached fallopian tube measures 4.0 cm in length and has a fimbriated end. The tube measures 0.5 cm in average diameter with tan-pink serosa.  Section of the fallopian tube shows a lumen measuring up to o.1 cm in diameter. Representative sections. C. Left ovary - 1 D.

Entirely submitted. M. 1 8: FROZEN SECTION OBTURATOR Labeled "frozen section obturator", received fresh in the Operating Room for frozen section diagnosis and subsequently fixed in formalin are two lymph nodes measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm and 4.5 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. Two cuts of the larger lymph node was utilized for frozen section. The rest of the lymph node tissue entirely submitted.. N. Frozen section remnant - 2 O-Q. Large lymph node - multiple R,S.

The uterus is symmetric and measures 10.5 cm from fundus to ectocervix, 8.0 cm cornu to cornu and 6.5 cm anterior to 8.5 cm. The cervix is largely replaced by a firm tan-red, ulcerated, fungating mass. The barrel shaped mass measures 8.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm. The mass is 0.1 cm, 0.6 cm, 0.4cm, and 0.6 cm from the (continued on next page) lepartment of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Page: deep cervical margins ot the posterior, anterior, left, and right respectively (deep margin being the external surface of the cervix). A vaginal cuff surrounds the mass and measures .0 cm wide posteriorly to 4.0 cm wide anteriorly.  The tumor is therefore 1 cm from the closest vaginal resection margin.  The mass involves the whole endocervical canal and extends into the lower uterine. segment/isthmus. The bulk of the uterine corpus is grossly uninvolved.  The endometrial cavity measures 4.0 cm long and 3.7 cm wide, and is covered by tan soft, smooth endometrium that measures up to 0.5 cm in thickness. Section of the uterine corpus reveal mildly trabecular myometrium and two intramural and one subserosal, well circumscribed firm tan-white whorled masses without grossly evident hemorrhages or areas of necrosis. inked blue.
