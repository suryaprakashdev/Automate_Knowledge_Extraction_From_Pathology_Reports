Site: Ylosder, Sotiral wall cb7.2 4. Left external iliac. QJ s%|14 5. Left obturator lymph node 6. Right ureteric resection margin. 7. Left ureteric resection margin CLINICAL DETAILS Radical cystectomy for invasive cancer MACROSCOPY 1. A radical cystectomy specimen comprising bladder measuring 55 x 50 x 45mm urethra 35mm in length and stump of cervix 23mm in length. There is no uterus or adnexae. Within the bladder there is a fungating tumour on the left lateral wall and superior wall measuring 35mm x 22mm x 13mm. The specimen includes the entire anterior wall of the vagina and the urethral margin includes vulval mucosa. The tumour extends through the bladder wall into the perivesical soft tissue. 2. Piece of fatty tissue 91 x 32 x 12mm containing six lymph nodes, the largest 28mm maximum dimension. 3. Piece of fatty tissue measuring 64 x 8 x 7mm containing two lymph nodes, the larger 10mm maximum dimension. 4. Piece of fatty tissue 58 x 12 x 6mm containing two lymph nodes, the larger 14mm maximum dimension. 5. Fatty tissue measuring 61 x 32 x 15mm containing five lymph nodes, the largest 21mm maximum dimension. 6. A segment of ureter measuring 5 x 3mm. 7. A segment of ureter measuring 10mm in length, 5mm diameter with an attached suture. MICROSCOPY Pw T35,5% squomous 1. The tumour is a poorly differentiated (WHO grade 3) transitional cell carcinoma, with a largely solid growth pattern. Foci of necrosis and squamous differentiation are noted. No carcinoma in situ is seen in the adjacent or background urothelium. The macroscopic impression of tumour extending beyond the muscularis propria is confirmed microscopically (pT3b). There is tumour invasion into medium sized muscular arteries. The closest margin is the left lateral serosal margin which lies 2mm away. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified. The tumour does not invade into the vagina. The urethral margin is morphologically normal with no evidence of dysplasia or in situ changes. All the surgical margins are clear of tumour. 2. Six nodes have been examined, none of which are involved by metastatic tumour. 3. Two nodes have been examined, neither of which are involved by metastatie tumour. 4. Two nodes have been examined, neither of which are involved by metastatic tumour. 5. Five nodes have been examined, none of which are involved by metastatic tumour.
