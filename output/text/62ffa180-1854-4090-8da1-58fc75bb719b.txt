TCGA-CW-5591 Surgical Pathology REVISED REpORT (Addendum/Procedure included) TISSUE DESCRIPTION:S Right kidney (16 x 15 x 6 cm) with 7 cm of left ureter, biopsy from. right kidney. (3 x 2 x 0.8 cm), tissue from right lower lobe lung retrocaval lymph nodes and intra-aortic caval tissue (2.3 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) DIAGNOSIS: Kidney, right, biopsy: Grade 2 (of 4) renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type.  Coagulative necrosis present. Kidney, right, radical nephrectomy: Grade 2 (of 4) renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, forms a 14.0 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm mass located in the right kidney.
