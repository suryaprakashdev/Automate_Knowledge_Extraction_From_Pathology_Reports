Tumour Size LBD 15mm Height 12mm MICROSCOPY Histologically, the enucleated eye demonstrates a normal. anterior segment with an unremarkable cornea, a deep anterior chamber and open angles. The iris leaves are. unremarkable. The lens shows advanced cataractous changes. ciliary muscle and body. This is bilobed and extends posteriorly into the adjacent choroid. In the central apical.

The tumour is associated with disruption of the ciliary body processes and with a detachment of the retina. It is pigmented and consists of a mixture of cells, both epithelioid and spindle cells, with a dominance of the former cell type.' The melanoma cells are immunoreactive for MelanA, cDli7 and Hsp-27 (score 1). The number of mitoses is approx. 21/40 high power fields.. The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, and closed loops are present in the tissue planes evaluated. The lymphocytic infiltrate within tumour is minimal. Macrophages are scattered throughout the tumour in a moderate. density.There is no evidence of scleral invasion or of. extraocular growth. The optic nerve is tumour free, and demonstrates mild atrophic changes. The examined vortex veins are free of tumour. FINAL DIAGNOSIS Choroidal melanoma of epithelioid cell type. COMMENT Molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the tumour cells will be performed using multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLpA), looking at chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8. A supplementary report will follow as soon as these investigations are complete. MOLECULAR GENETICS In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed. using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLpA). These investigations were performed in the The kit p027 from , which examines for gains or. losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, . 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using and the Reported: Pathologist: Electronlcally Verified:

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLpA products is. printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated: Normal chromosome 1, monosomy 3, normal chromosome 6 and gains in chromosome 8. Taken together, these molecular data would place the patient. in the high risk group with respect to the development of. metastatic melanoma. Consideration of clinical features of the tumour is, however, also required. Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified: j 12/19/13 UALIFIED
