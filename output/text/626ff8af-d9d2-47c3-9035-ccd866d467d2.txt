PAGE 2 RUN DATE: Specimen Inquiry RUN TIME: RUN USER: (Continued) PATIENT: SPEC #: GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for Tissue Banking. labeled with the patient's name and designatod "left breast". Received with two inserted needle localization wires is a 586 gram. 21.0 x 14.0 x 4.5 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast is received with an overlying 20.5 x 12.0 cm skin ellipse. The skin is tan/white and mottled with an eccentric. lateral 9.0 x 8.0 cm areola and indurated 1.5 cm nipple. There are focal pigmented papules on the skin surface. The breast has been oriented with a short suture at one pole of the skin ellipse designating medial. a short double suture designating superior and a double long suture designating deep. The deep margin will be inked blue with the superior margin inked black. the inferior margin inked red. medial is inked yellow and lateral green. The skin surface has an indurated 8.0 x 2.5 cm area extending medial from the nipple. There are focal skipped areas on this lesion with the medial most lesion being 1.5 cm at the medial pole. Sectioning of these indurated areas shows tumor associated with the skin. The tumor extends from beneath the nipple medially with the medial most lesion being 1.2 cm from the inferior. skin edge and approximately 2.2 cm from the medial pole of the skin. No additional areas of induration extend close to the skin margin. The breast is serially sectioned from medial to lateral to have a tumor mass extending across the breast for approximately 5.0 cm. The mass extends from the lateral aspect beneath the nipple medially where it goes from being approximately 1.0 cm in thickness to 2.5 cm. The tumor extends and becomes 5.5 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm and comes within 2.5 cm of the nearest deep margin. The tumor is 3.0 cm from inferior. is approximately 4.5 cm from superior. is 3.0 cm from medial and is approximately 6 cm from lateral with the skin lesion coming within 4.5 cm of lateral. The parenchyma is glistening. yellow and fatty with scant white fibrous tissue. The white fibrous tissue makes up less than 10% of the parenchyma. The tumor predominantly involves ths central medial aspect of the breast. Representative sections are sampled as labeled in the following cassettes: 1 nipple trisected 2 en face section of araola where nipple has been removed. 3 sections with darker papules to include section with subcutaneous tumor adjacent to nearest inferior medial margin. 4-5 additional sections of subcutaneous tumor 6 sections extending lateral and medial from the area where the nipple has been removed 7 lateral most extension of tumor to include overlying skin. 8 nearest deep margin 9-11 near full cross sections of largest area of tumor sampled. 12 upper/outer quadrant sampled 13 lower/outer quadrant sampled 14 upper/inner quadrant sampled 15 lower/inner quadrant sampled PHOTO DOCUMENTATION Image Signed (signature on file). k* END OF REPORT ** lw 31
