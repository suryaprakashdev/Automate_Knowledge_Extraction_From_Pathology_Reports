Resident Pathologist:. Dictated by: received fresh labeled with the patient's name,. The specimen and designated 'right neck level 2-4'. It consists. rous soft tissue measuring 15 x 2.5 x 1.1 cm. Levels 2-4 are designated with staples and arbitrarily separated. Blunt dissection reveals two (2) lymph nodes in level 2, and one (1) lymph node in level 3, and five candidate lymph nodes in level 4.  Those along with soft remaining tissue are submitted.

The specimen. consists of a total laryngectomy measuring 10.5 x 8.5 x 6 cm,. including a portion of the hyoid bone measuring 7.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm, the larynx from epiglottis to subglottis and three (3) tracheal rings. There is an irregular, firm tan white mass with ulceration measuring 3.1 x 3.2 x 1.6 cm located in the supraglottis and grossly involving the false cord and possibly the true cord. The mass is less than 0.2 cm from the closest mucosal margin (left aryepiglottic fold) and 3.6 cm from the distal tracheal margin. The mass invades into the lamina propria, grossly very close (less than 0.1 to 0.2 cm of the inked margin. The mass does not appear to grossly invade into the serially sectioned red brown strap muscles (which are unremarkable). or into the thyroid cartilage. Along with standard sections, a midline section is submitted for decalcification. Approximately 5% of .the total specimen is submitted.
