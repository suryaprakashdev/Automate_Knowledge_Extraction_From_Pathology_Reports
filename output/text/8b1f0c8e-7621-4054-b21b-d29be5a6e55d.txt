SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 3.SP:lymph nodes,left hilar,excision Lymph Nodes: Number of nodes examined:1 Number of metastatic nodes:0 Unremarkable ectopic adrenal tissue IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THESLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL),AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED ANDAPPROVED THIS REPORT Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh labeled "left kidney" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter,renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 1100 g in total. The kidney measures 15.0 x 11.0x 7.0 cm. The attached ureter measures 7.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter.The attached renal vein measures 1.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable.An adrenal gland is not identified.The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a 12.5 x 10.0 x 7.0 cm cortical mass located in the mid portion of the kidney.The cut surface of the mass is tan, hemorrhagic and necrotic.The mass invades the Gerota's fascia grossly but does not invade the renal pelvis.Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma,with a well-defined corticomedullary junction. The cortex measures 0.5 cm and the calyces appear normal. No lymph nodes identified.Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections. Photograph has been taken. Summary of sections: UVM-- ureteral and vessel margins T-tumor THF--tumor with hilar fat TSF--tumor with sinus fat TK-tumor with adjacent kidney U-- ureter representative sections K-- representative sections of kidney TG-tumor with capsule 2).The specimen is received in formalin,labeled "left periaortic lymph node" and consists of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension.All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN- lymph nodes 3).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled left hilar lymph node" and consists of 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm portion of adipose tissue. No lymph node identified.Entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U-undesignated Summary of Sections: Part1SP kidney, left, radical nephrectomy Page2of3
