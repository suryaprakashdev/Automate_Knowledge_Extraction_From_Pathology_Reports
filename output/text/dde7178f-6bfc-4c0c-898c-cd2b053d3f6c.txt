By Dr. called to Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. NON-SENTINEL NODES RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh and labeled with the patient name designated "A -- non-sentinel nodes right axilla", are 2 portions of fibroadipose tissue demonstrating 2 presumptive palpable lymph nodes; one lymph node measures 3.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm, the second measures 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm. Both nodes are bisected. Touch prep performed. One lymph node is submitted in cassette A1 and the second is submitted in cassette A2. B. RIGHT BREAST Received fresh and labeled with the patient name designated *B -- right breast", is a resected mastectomy specimen weighing 1,383 grams and measuring 29.5 x 22.0 x 4.0 cm. The attached axillary tail measures 13.0 x 7.2 x 1.5 cm. A suture indicates the axillary region. The posterior margin is inked black. The white-beige ellipse of overlying skin measures 21.8 x 11.0. The light beige areola measures 3.5 cm in diameter. The inverted nipple measures 1.0 cm in diameter. The surface of the skin is dense and wrinkled. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral. Cut section shows two firm beige distinct lesions; the larger lesion is located in the lower inner quadrant in the subareolar region and measures 3.6 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm located 4.4 cm from the smaller lesion. The smaller lesion is firm present in the upper inner quadrant measuring 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. The larger lesion is 5.1 cm from the deep margin. The smaller lesion approaches the deep margin at a distance of 2.0 cm. The remainder of the specimen shows dark yellow lobulated adipose tissue. Many firm lymph nodes are demonstrated in the axillary tail ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm up to 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1-B2: The smaller lesion submitted entirely with overlying deep margin. B3-B9: Sections from the larger lesion B10: Margin overlying the larger lesion B11-B13: Sections of nipple B14: Section of skin adjacent to nipple B15: Additional section of skin B16-B17: Representative sections upper outer quadrant B18-B19: Representative sections lower outer quadrant B20: Additional section upper inner quadrant B21-B22: One bisected lymph node B23: One-half of one bisected lymph node B24: One bisected lymph node B25: Three possible lymph nodes B26: Three possible lymph nodes UUID:42E3E8C1-D18A-4457-B2F0-FE49F4C027D7 Redacted B27: Four possible lymph nodes TCGA-E2-A1LE-01A-PR 1111 B28: Four possible lymph nodes B29: Four possible lymph nodes B30: One lymph node B31: One lymph node  B32: One lymph node DIAGNOSIS: A.

Biopsy showed an adenocarcinoma, ER/PR-, Her2+, 2 masses at right breast seen. One at 12 o'clock position subareolar, 2nd mass at 1 o'clock posterior to 1st mass (3.0 cm). PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Infiltrating adenocarcinoma ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimen:  Surgical Excision Block Number: B4 ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 PR: Negative Allred Score:  0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0

TsS: COMMENT: The Alred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8.. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY:  Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: B4 Interpretation: POSITIVE Intensity: 3+ % Tumor Staining: 90% Fish Ordered: No METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved HercepTest (TM) test kit using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by tne manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in- house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. Gross Dictation: Pathologist, Microscopic/Diagnostic Dictation: Patholoaist. Final Review: Patholoaist.
