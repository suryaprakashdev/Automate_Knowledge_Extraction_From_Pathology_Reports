REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (pN): pN2a: Metastasis in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2.0. mm) Number examined:18 Number involved: 5 DISTANT METASTASIS (M): pMX: Cannot be assessed MARGINS:  Margin(s) involved by invasive carcinoma Specify which margin(s): Inferior margin at mastectomy (specimen D). See comment.. *EXTENT OF MARGIN INVOLVEMENT FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA *VENOUS/LYMPHATIC (LARGE/SMALL VESSEL) INVASION (V/L): *Present *MICROCALCIFICATIONS: *Present in DCIS *ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Fibrocystic changes, biopsy site related changes, and columnar cell hyperplasia. *COMMENT(S): The inferior margin is invovled by carcinoma in the mastectomy specimen (specimen D).. however, additionally submitted inferior resection margin is not involved (specimen E). Clinical. correlation is necessary for interpretation of these findings. Diagnostic Comment According to previous biopsy, 65% of tumor cells show moderate to strong nuclear staining for estrogen receptors, 80% of tumor cells show nuc!ear staining show strong nuclear staining for progesterone receptors, and Her2-neu gene is not amplified by FiSH (please see report

Snecimen A: Designated "sentinel node #1" is received fresh for intraoperative consultation on fabeled with the patient's name and "sentinel node #1". Specimen consists one piece of yellow tissue measuring 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. The lymph node is bisected. Touch prep is done. No frozen section is performed. Section code: A1 -- two pieces, one lymph node, entire specimen. Specimen B; Designated "sentinel node #2" is received fresh for intraoperative consultation on iabeled with the patient's name and "sentinel node #2". Specimen consists of one yellow/tan irregular fragment of tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. No intraoperative procedure performed. Entirely submitted for permanent sections.. Section code: B1 -- entire specimen.. Specimen C: Designated *sentinel node #3" is received fresh for intraoperative consuitation on labeled with the patient's name and "sentinel node #3". Specimen consists of one yellow/tan fatty fragment of tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is bisected revealing one lymph node. No intraoperative procedure performed. Entirely submitted for permanent sections. Section code: C1 -- two pieces, one lymph node, entire specimen. Specimen D: Designated "right mastectomv (stitch on lateral margin, clip on apex of dissection)" is received fresh for Tumor Bank on. iabeled with the patient's name, MRN and "right. mastectomy (stitch on lateral margin, clip on apex of dissection)". Specimen consists of one right radical mastectomy with attached axillary tail weighing 220.8 g. The specimen measures 30.0 x 7.0 x 2.5 cm. The axillary tail measures 13.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. The breast measures 17.0 x 6.0 x 2.5 cm. There is an overiying ellipse of tan wrinkled skin measuring 15.0 x 6.0 cm. There is an unremarkable nipple measuring 1.5 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in thickness. The areola measures 4.0 x 3.5 cm and is unremarkable. The external palpation of skin reveals two firm masses which are inferior lateral to the nipple, at the outer lower quadrant. One is at 3.5 cm from the nipple and the other is at 2.0 cm from the nipple. The suture is identified which denotes the lateral margin. Cut surface reveals two white/tan spiculated tumors. The medial tumor measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm with what appears to be a. previous biopsy site. The more lateral tumor mass measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and also appears to have a previous biopsy site. The tumor masses appear to be connected by a white/tan tract of tumor

Page 4 of 4 measuring 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The lateral tumor comes within <0.1 cm of the inferior margin and 0.2 cm of the deep margin. The medial tumor comes within 0.1 cm of the inferior margin and appears to abut the deep margin. Both tumors are >3.0 cm from the superior and medial margins. The remainder of the cut sections are grossly unremarkable as yellow/tan fatty fibrous tissue. There is a free floating fragment of breast tissue measuring 8.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm with a staple denoting the media! position. The fragment weighs 3.9 g. This fragment is oriented with the assistance of according to him, it represents the deep margin. The fragment is oriented regarding lateral and medial and aspects. The axillary tall is dissected and eleven lymph nodes are identified. The lateral tumor comes within ~0.2 cm of skin and the medial tumor comes within 1.0 cm of skin.. Inking code - breast: Green -- superior portion of breast; Blue -- inferior portion of breast; Black -- deep. portion of breast: Orange -- area of further resection, inferiorly, adjacent to additional inferior margin (specimen E). Inking code -- additional fragment of tissue (deep margin): Black -- entire external surface of free deep fragment; Green -- medial tip of free deep fragment..

Specimen E: Designated "new inferior margin" is received in formalin iabeled with the patient's name and "new inferior margin". Specimen consists of one yellow/tan fatty fragment of tissue weighing 10.6 g and measuring 5.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The new inferior margin is inked in blue and the specimen is serially sectioned. Cut sections reveal a yellow/tan fatty interior that is grossly unremarkable. Section code: E1-E6 - entire specimen. hw s|3i3
