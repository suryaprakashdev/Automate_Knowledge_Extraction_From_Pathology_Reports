in a separate Molecular Pathology report.. Clinical History: -year-old male with a clinical diagnosis of colon cancer.. Gross Description: Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally labeled "rectosigmoid junction, stitch is distal" and holds a 15 cm in length x 3.5 cm in open circumference segment of large. bowel oriented as stated above. The proximal mucosal margin is inked blue, the distal mucosal margin is inked black, and the tinea and surrounding yellow lobulated fat is inked green for identification purposes. Approximately 6.5 cm from the proximal mucosal margin and 5.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin, there is a 5.2 cm proximal to distal x 4.0 cm circumferential tan firm mass with central ulceration and raised edges.. The mass on section extends up to 1.2 cm through the muscularis propria into the attached yellow lobulated fat. The mass comes to within 0.8 cm from the yellow intact peritonealized surface. The mass is present at the rectosigmoid junction and is not. surrounded by mesorectum. No additional abnormalities are noted. Tumor and normal are submitted to tissue procurement.. Block Summary: Al - Proximal en face mucosal margin. A2-A3 - Distal en face mucosal margin. A4 - Mesenteric vascular pedicle margin. A5 - Lymph node present at mesenteric vascular pedicle margin, bisected A6-A7 - Mass with extension into fat. A8 - Mass with respect to tinea A9 - Additional section of mass with extension into fat A10 - One lymph node trisected Al1 - One lymph node, trisected A12-A13 - Multiple lymph nodes, each cassette. A14 - One lymph node bisected Al5-A16 - Multiple lymph nodes each cassette A17-A19 - One lymph node each cassette, each sectioned. Tissue remains in formalin. Addendum To add the results of immunostains Addendum Comment Immunostains for mismatch repair protein expression are performed on
