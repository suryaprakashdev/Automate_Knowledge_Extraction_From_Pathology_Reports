SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: none provided GROSS DESCRIPTION: A: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, and designated "Right Breast, long-lateral, short-superior, double-deep. stitches" consists of a 344 gm mastectomy specimen oriented with short superior to inferior, 18.0 cm medial to lateral, and 3.0 cm anterior to posterior. The darkly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 9.5 x 3.5 cm and displays a 1.0 cm centrally located, flat nipple free of discharge. The deep margin is inked black and the superficial margin is inked blue. Serial sections reveal a centrally located, well-defined mass measuring 3.0 cm (superior to inferior) x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The mass is subjacent to (and continuous with) the nipple and comes to within 1.3 'cm. of the deep margin. The cut surface is pink-white, firm and gritty with peripheral congestion. The fibrous tissue surrounding the mass is markedly dense and diffusely nodular, suggestive of an additional focal lesion. The remainder of the specimen is composed moderately of dense fibrous tissue admixed with lobulated, yellow-tan adipose tissue. No lymph nodes are. identified. Representative sections are submitted.. Cassette Summary: A1- nipple with subjacent mass; A2- mass with deep margin; A3-A5- mass; A6- mass with skin; A7-A8- deep margin to tumor, central breast; A9- lower mid, adjacent (inferior) to tumor; A1o- margin of A9; A11- central breast, adjacent (medial) to tumor; A12- margin of A1l; A13- upper outer quadrant, 4.5 cm from tumor; A14- margin of A13; A15- lower outer quadrant, 4.5 cm from tumor; A16- lower inner quadrant with deep adjacent to tumor; Al7- upper inner quadrant adjacent to tumor; Matched sections of A1, A3-A7, A9, Ai1, A13 and A15-A17 are submitted in. ocr for protocol. B: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "Sentinel Node #1 Right Axilla" consists 0r a 1.5 x 1.2 x o.7. and cm possible lymph node. The lymph node is bisected to reveal a firm, tan-white cut surface. The specimen is submitted in cassette B1. A matched section of section of B1 is submitted in ocr for protocol. C: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Right Axilla" consists"of" two possible  and lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The cut surface of the larger possible lymph node is pink-white and firm. The lymph nodes are submitted as follows:. Cassette Summary: C1- one lymph node; c2- one lymph node bisected. A matched section of c1 is submitted in ocr for. protocol. Page 3 Continued on Next Page "FOR OFPICIAL USER ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF
