LIVER, SEGMENT III, BIOPSY: -BENIGN LIVER PARENCHYMA AND VESSELS. 3. FALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY, LEFT, RESECTION: -BENIGN FALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY. FALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY, RIGHT, RESECTION: -BENIGN FALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. 1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon. The terminal ilewm measures 3.5 cm in length and 4 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 28 cm in length with a circumference of 8 cm at the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measures 5 cm in Iength and measures 0.4 cm in diameter at its distal end; however dilated to 2.5 cm at the proximal end. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic lohulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 1 cm in thickness.  The specimen is apened to reveal an exophytic mass lesion measuring 6.8 x 5.8 x 1.5 cm. The mass is centered in the appendiceal Orifice, 3.5 cm from the proximal margin and 23 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tunor invades through muscularis propria to the serosal surface. The depth of invasion is 1.2 cm grosaly. The remaining ** Continued on next page **

Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for Tps. Sumnary of sections: P - proximal margin shave.  distal margin shave - appendix from distal to proximal including its orifice involved by the tumor TCE - tumox (cecun) rCO tumor (colon) TIC- tumor (ileocecal valve) LN - lymph nodes 2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Liver biopsy segment. three" and consists of two tan-brown fragments of soft tissue measuring 0.8x 0.3 x 0.2 cm and 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. The larger wedge shaped fragment is. Inked at the surgical margin and bisected. The entire specimen is submitted. Summary of sections: L--larger tissue S--smaller tissue 3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left fallopian tube and ovary" and consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary.. The fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter.. The external surface of the tube is pink tan and smooth with a normal fimbriated end, multiple paratubal cyste are identified averaging 0.l cm. Cut section through the tube reveals a pinpoint lumen. The attached ovary weighs 2.5 g. and measures 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The external surface is yellow.and smooth.. Cut section through the ovary reveals yellow-white ovarlan stroma. No. discrete lesions are grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: - fallopian tube 0 - ovary 4). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right fallopian tube and ovary" and consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary. The fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in dianeter. The external surface of the tube is pink tan and smooth with a normal fimbriated end. Paratubal cysts are identified averaging 0.2 cm. Cut section through the tube reveals a pinpoint lunen. The attached ovary weighs 2.5 g and. measures 3.1 x 1.5  x 1.3 cm. The external surface is yellow and smooth Cut section through the ovary reveals yellow-white ovarian stroma. Representative sections are aubmitted. * Continued on next page.
