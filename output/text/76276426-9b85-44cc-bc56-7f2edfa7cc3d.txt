Department of Pathology Tissue Source Site (TSS) #: Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS (A) RIGHT KIDNEY: RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (SEE COMMENT) TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. TUMOR MEASURES 5.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION. Ureteral, vascular and soft tissue margins are free of tumor. Renal medullary interstitial tumor (0.2 cm). COMMENT The renal cell carcinoma is composed of approximately 70% clear cells and 30% eosinophilic cells. Centrally, the tumor demonstrates an area of marked hyalinization. There is no unequivocal tumor extension into the perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor abuts the renal sinus without invasion into the adipose tissue. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT KIDNEY, EN BLOC - A nephrectomy specimen (18.0 x 10.0 x 9.0 cm). The kidney measures 12.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm with attached grossly unremarkable segment of ureter measuring 4.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. A 5.5 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm, irregular mass is identified at the lower pole of the kidney. The tumor has variegated cut surfaces. with hemorrhagic areas, a central firm fibrotic tan-yellow area and a peripheral fleshy areas. The tumor appears to abut the. perinephric adipose tissue without unequivocal invasion. The tumor approaches the renal sinuses. However, no gross tumor is. identified in the adipose tissue of renal sinus. No tumor is identified within the renal vein or renal calyces.. Four small tan-white, well-circumscribed nodules measuring 0.3 cm in maximum dimension each are identified within the renal medulla. The rest of the renal parenchyma is unremarkable. No lymph node or adrenal gland is identified. A small portion of the tumor is submitted for possible microscopic study. Specimen photographs are taken. SECTION CODE: A1, resection margins of renal vein, ureter, renal artery; A2, A3, tumor with perinephric adipose tissue; A4-A6, representative sections from the central firm and fibrotic area; A7-A9, representative sections of the tumor from the hemorrhagic area; A10-A12, representative sections of the tumor from the fleshy area; A13, A14, tumor with renal sinus; A15, four small medullary nodules; A16, representative sections of the uninvolved kidney. CLINICAL HISTORY None given. SNOMED CODES T-71000, M-83123
