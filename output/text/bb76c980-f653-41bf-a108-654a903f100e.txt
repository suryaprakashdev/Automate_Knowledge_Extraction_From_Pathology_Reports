The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Sentinel node number one, level 1, right axilla" and consists of 7 lymph nodes and measure 3.5 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm in aggregate.

FSC-frozen section control PA 3. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Sentinel node number three, level 2, right axilla" and consists of two soft tan lymph nodes totaling 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: MD 4). The specimen is received fresh in a container, labeled "Right breast and axillary contents levels 1, 2 and 3 with tags attached". The specimen consists of a mastectomy measuring 30 x 19 x 3 cm..  That axillary tail measures 13 x 8 x 2 cm. The overlying ellipse of skin measures i0 x 3 cm.. No scar can be identified on the skin. The nipple measures 1 x 1 cm and it is grossly unremarkable... The deep resection margin is inked blue.. specimen is serially sectioned revealing a pinkish red, relatively The well-circumscribed and firm lesion measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm which closely abuts the inked resection margin. The lesion is 2 cm away from the skin. The lesion is located in the iower inner quadrant. Surrounding the lesion,. are areas of fibrosis which show punctate areas of cheesy necrosis. Away from this lesion, in the lower outer quadrant is a vaguely defined area of fibrosis and nodularity. Approximate measurements of this area are 10 x 6 cm.  The upper inner and outer quadrants show mainly fatty tissue. axillary dissection is performed revealing 3 level one lymph nodes, 4 level An two lymph nodes and 2 level three lymph nodes.
