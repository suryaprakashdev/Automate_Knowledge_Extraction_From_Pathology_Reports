The patient is a. -year-old male wno, per the electronic medical recorr. has three renal masses of the right kidney e now undergoes a laparoscopic right nephrectomy. Gross Description The specimen is received fresh in one part, Iabeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "right kidney," and consists of a single kidney (17.5 x 7.8 x 6.3 cm, 448.5 gm) with attached ureter (4.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm). The specimen contains three nodules. Nodule 1 is located in the Inferior pole and is composed of a well-circumscribed, yellow-brown, soft, spheroid nodule (4.2 x 3.9 x 3.8 cm) and comes to within 0.6 cm of the renal sinus, 4.5 cm of the vascular margin, 3.2 cm of the ureteral margin, and comes to within 0.1 cm of the soft tissue margin. The soft tissue overlying this nodule is loose and non-adherent. Nodule 2 is located on the superior pole of the kidney and is composed of a yellow-tan, rubbery, well-circumscribed, spheroid nodule (1.6 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm). It is 1.6 cm from the renal sinus,. 5.5 cm from the vascular margin, 8.5 cm from the ureteral margin, and 0.2 cm from the soft tissue margin. The overlying soft tissue is loose and non-adherent. Nodule 3 is located at the mid kidney and is composed of a yellow-gold, soft, well-circumscribed, ovoid mass (3.1 x 1.6 x 2.5 cm). It is 0.1 cm from the soft tissue margin, 0.4 cm from the renal sinus, 3.5 cm from the vascular margin, and 9.1 cm from the ureteral margin. The overlying soft tissue is loose and non-adherent. The renal arterial wall is thickened and yellow. The renal sinus is extensively dissected for lymph nodes. The renal vein is free of tumor. There is no adrenal gland present after extensive dissection. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation as follows:. Cassette A1: Ureteral margin and cross-section. Cassette A2: Vascular margins. Cassette A3: Nodule 1, in relation to soft tissue margin, renal pelvis.. Cassette A4: Nodule 1, in relation to capsule. Cassette A5: Nodule 1, in relation to renal sinus, pelvis.. Cassette A6: Nodule 1, in relation to renal capsule.. Cassette A7: Nodule 2, in relation to soft tissue margin, renal capsule.. Cassette A8: Nodule 2, in relation to soft tissue margin.. Cassette A9: Nodule 3, in relation to soft tissue margin, renal capsule.. Cassette A10: Nodule 3, in relation to soft tissue margin, renal capsule.. Cassette A11: Nodule 3, in relation to renal pelvis, soft tissue margin. Cassette A12: One candidate lymph node, bisected.. Cassette A13: Multiple candidate lymph nodes, submitted intact.. Cassette A14: Unremarkable cortex, medulla and sinus, superior pole. Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all pathology slides.. Pathology Resident Pathologist Electronicaily signed out on lw:16114 QUAUFIERS ewed|2 a413 Page 2 of 2
