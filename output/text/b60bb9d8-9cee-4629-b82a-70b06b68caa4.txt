Specimens Submitted 1: SP: Right kidney 2: SP: Paracaval n DIAGNOSIS: 1) KIDNEY, RIGHT; NEPHRECTOMY: - RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CHROMOPHOBE CELL TYPE. THE TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER IS 5.2 CM. THE TUMOR IS CONFINED WITHIN THE RENAL CAPSULE. NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR. THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS A SIMPLE CYST (1 CM IN DIAMETER). THE ADRENAL GLAND IS NOT SUBMITTED. 2) LYMPH NODES, PARACAVAL; EXCISION: - THREE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (O/3). Gross Description: 1)  The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled. "Right kidney". It consists of a kidney, partially surrounded by yellow-tan, lobulated, perinephritic fatty tissue. The specimen weighs 420 grams and measures 12.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm. The kidney has a portion of ureter attached, measuring 7.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The ureter is probed, opened and shows a light tan, smooth and shiny inner surface. The kidney shows a smooth, shiny capsule. The specimen is bivalved. Approximately 0.4 cm close to the capsule in the center, attached to but not. extending to the pelvis, there is a well-circumscribed, pink-dark Page 1of 3

Approximately 1.3 cm from the capsule in the lower pole of the kidney is an oval cystic mass with a smooth surface, measuring. 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm,  containing dark brown fluid. The renal vein and artery are also probed and opened, showing a light tan, smooth and shiny inner surface. The rest of the kidney. parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.
