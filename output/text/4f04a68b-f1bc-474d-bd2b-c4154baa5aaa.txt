FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT Diagnosis: A.-B.)RENAL MASS,RIGHT,AND BASE OF RIGHTRENAL MASS,RESECTION, -RENAL CELL CARCINOMA,PAPILLARYVARIANT, TYPEI. - Tumor measures 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. - Tumor confined to kidney. - No lymphovascular or perineural invasion identified. -MARGINS:INDETERMINATE (SEE COMMENT) -LYMPH NODES:NONE IDENTIFIED PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SUMMARY: Type and grade: Renal cell carcinoma, papillary variant, type I. Primary tumor: pT1a. Regional lymph nodes: pNX. Distant metastasis: pMX. Margin status: Indeterminate Pathologic stage:I. Lymphovascular invasion:Not identified Perineural invasion: Not identified. COMMENT: Immunohistochemical studies show that the tumor is positive for PAX-8, CD10, racemase, and EMA. It is negative for inhibin, CK5/6, p63, CK7, CK20,CD117, synaptophysin, and chromogranin. The staining patterns support the given diagnosis. All the immunohistochemical studies were interpreted hereat The inhibin stain is the only stain which was performed outside, at Due to the fragmented nature of the specimen, the margin status cannot be accurately determined by pathologic examination. Both specimen B and thethree cauterized fragments of renal tissue (in cassette A8) are free of tumor.I am not certain whether the combination of specimen B and the tissue in A8 is the completesurgical margin and whether or not it was fully overlying the pieces of specimenA that have tumor at the edge. Clinical correlation regarding the margin status is suggested. Kidney Tumor Staging Information Page 1 This report continues... (FINAL)

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT A.Mass;right renal mass B.Mass;base of right renal mass Clinical History/Operative Dx: Right renal mass Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled right renal mass and is received without fixative. It consists of an ovoid  fragment of renal tissue which measures 3 x 2.3 x 1.3 cm. The apparent cortical surface has a slightly  irregular contour and is dull red. The opposite surface (deep surface) shows a rim of prominent cautery artifact and approximately two-thirds of the deep surface has a torn and disrupted appearance with friable  tumor present. The cauterized portion of the deep margin of this specimen is inked blue. On serial sectioning of this specimen, there is a partially cavitary and very friable tumor mass present which. measures 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm.Also in the specimen container are multiple fragmentsof friable tan to light x 2 cm in aggregate and weighing 39 grams. The specimen container also has three additional fragments. of heavily cauterized renal tissue which vary from 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm to 1.7 x0.9 x 0.4 cm.Each of these fragments has focally cauterized surface.Sections of the adipose tissue reveal no grossly identifiable tumor. Representative sections of the tumor are obtained for research purposes. The entire resection of. kidney tissue is sequentially submitted in cassettes A1-A6. Representative sections of the separately submitted friable tumor are submitted in cassette A7. The smaller fragments of cauterized renal tissue are submitted in cassette A8 and representative sections of the separately submitted adipose tissue are submitted in cassette A9 B. The specimen is labeled base of right renal (tumor) mass and is received in formalin. It consists of five. fragments of dark brown to nearly black, heavily cauterized tissue which are 1 cm inaggregate. The. largest intact fragment measures 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.The tissue is entirely submitted in cassette B1 Microscopic Description: A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. B. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered.
