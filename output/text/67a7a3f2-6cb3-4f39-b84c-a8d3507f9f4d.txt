Jcs-0 - 3 Fatient. QcF: brust,N63 C50.9 Surgical Pathology: Fina! Surg Path CLINICAL HISTORY: Breast cancer. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Left breast and axilla", received fresh. The specimen is a 22.7 x 11.5 x 2.5 cm mastectomy specimen. The overlying skin ellipse measures 17.0 x 11.0 cm, and includes a 5.5 cm areola and 1.0 cm nipple. ~A well-healed 3.0 cm scar is noted just superior to the areola in the upper inner quadrant. The specimen includes an axillary tail which measures 11.0 cm x 7.0 cm. The margins of the specimen are inked in blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm tumor in the upper inner quadrant, extending medially to the upper outer quadrant. The tumor is firm, tannish-white, with a gritty consistency. It appears to be infiltrating. adjacent tissue. Tissue has been sent for estrogen and progesterone receptor assays. The tumor approaches to 1 cm of the deep margin. It approaches to 1.0 cm to the lateral margins. The remainder of the breast tissue is composed of lobular adipose tissue intermixed with reddish pink fibrous tissue. There is an area of dense white fibrous breast tissue in the upper outer quadrant. The axillary tail measures 13.5 x 8.0 cm. It is composed of yellow lobular adipose tissue. Several nodes are identified grossly. A 3.1 x 1.0 cm node is sectioned to reveal a firm 2.0 x 1.0 cm tan-white mass. The axillary tail is amputated, divided into three sections and searched for lymph nodes which are submitted as described below.. Block Summary: Al- section of skin through nipple and areola.

A9- tissue from the upper inner quadrant. A10- tissue from the lower inner quadrant. A11- tissue from lower outer quadrant. A12- tissue from upper outer quadrant.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: The previous biopsy site is located in the center of a large tumor mass consisting of infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Positive lymph nodes are tail, 2/2 (one macroscopically positive with extracapsular extension); mid axillary tail, 2/8; high axillary tail, 0/6. DIAGNOSIS: A.
