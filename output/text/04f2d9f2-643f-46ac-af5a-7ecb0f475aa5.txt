Entirely submitted for frozen section, FSA. B. LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "left partial nephrectomy" is an. intact, unoriented, partial nephrectomy specimen, 6.5 x 6 x 5.3 cm, with detached fragment of adipose. tissue, 13.2 x 4.5 x 2 cm, collectively weighing 104 g. The parenchymal margin inked black, remainder of kidney specimen inked blue. The kidney is sectioned to show an encapsulated, golden tan, lobulated,. soft friable mass measuring 6.2 x 6 x 5.3 cm, approaching the parenchymal margin at distance of 0.3
