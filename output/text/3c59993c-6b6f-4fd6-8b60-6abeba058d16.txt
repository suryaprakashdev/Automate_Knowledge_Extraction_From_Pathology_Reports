Precaval lymph nodes, frozen section diagnosis: Negative for malignancy. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Performed by A. Received fresh labeled and "precaval lymph node" is a 2 cm fatty lymph node entirely submitted for frozen section in one cassette labeled B. Received fresh labeled and "right renal mass". Procedure: Partial nephrectomy. Specimen laterality: Right. Tumor site: Right posterior mid pole. Tumor size: 2.9 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. Tumor focality: Unifocal. Gross extent of tumor: Extension into perinephric tissue: Absent.. Extension beyond Gerota's fascia: Absent. Extension into renal sinus: Absent. Extension into renal vein: Absent. Extension into collecting system: Absent.. Adrenal gland: Absent. Gross Notes: Gross tumor characteristics: The tumor is 2.9 cm in maximum dimension and has a bright yellow-red color with focal necrosis. The tumor is at least 0.4 cm from the nearest inked parenchymal. margin.  The tumor is adherent to the pericapsular fat which is inked blue. Block summary for specimen 1) tumor with margin. 2-3) sections of tumor. 4) tumor with capsule. Fresh normal tissue and fresh tumor are submitted for C. Received fresh labeled and "additional precaval lymph node" is a piece of adipose tissue, 5 cm in maximum dimension. Within the adipose tissue is one fatty lymph node, 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. The entire lymph node is bisected and submitted in one cassette labeled. Support for the diagnosis in this case may have included the use of immunohistochemistry tests that were developed and whose performance characteristics were determined by They have not been cleared or approved by the U.s. Food and Drug Administration (FdA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not.
