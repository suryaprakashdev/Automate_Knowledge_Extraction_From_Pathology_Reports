LT AXILLARY NODE DISSECTION Sit: breast, No3 C50.9 B. LT PARTIAL MASTECTOMY DESCREPTION PART A RECEIVED FRESH LABELED LEFT AXILLARY NODE DISSECTION, IS YELLOW-RED FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 15 X 12.5 X 4.0 CM. THIS IS EXAMINED FOR LYMPH NODES. THE NODAL TISSUE IS IDENTIFIED PRIMARILY AT ONE END OF THE SPECIMEN, NITH 75% CONSISTING OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE.  MULTIPLE LYMPH NODES ARE IDENTIFIED AND GROSSLY POSITIVE. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A1 THROUGH A8--ONE SECTION EACH OF GROSSLY POSITIVE LYMPH NODES WITH A RIBBON CLIP IDENTIFIED IN THE NODE CORRESPONDING TO A2. NOTE THAT MIRROR IMAGE RESEARCH BLOCKS ARE TAKEN ON EACH. A9 AND 10--ONE NODE EACH BISECTED, A11--TWO NODES EACH BISECTED, A12--TWO NODES, A13--ONE NODE BISECTED, A14--ONE NODE BISECTED, A15--ONE NODE BISECTED, A16 THROUGH A19--ONE GROSSLY FAT-REPLACED NODE TOTAL. PART B RECEIVED FRESH LABELED  LEFT PARTIAL MASTECTOMY LONG STITCH LATERAL SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR, IS AN OVOID PORTION OF YELLOW-PINK FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 11.5 X 7 X 4.7 CM IN GREATBST DIMENSIONS. THE SPECIMEN IS ORIENTED BY TWO SUTURES. A LARGK PALPABLE MASS IS PRESENT MEDIALLY.  SECTIONING REVEALS THIS PALPABLE MASS TO HAVE A FIRM PINK-TAN GRITTY CUT SURFACE MEASURING 4.0 X 2.8 X 3 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSIONS. THIS LESION EXTENDS TO THE INFERIOR MARGIN AND IS O.4 CM FROM THE MARGIN GROSSLY. IT IS 0.6 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN, 0.8 CM FROM THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN AND GREATER THAN 1 CM FROM ALL OTHER MARGINS. SECTIONING THE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE SPECIMEN CONSISTS OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: B1--PERPENDICULAR MEDIAL MARGIN, B2--TUMOR (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), B3--LESION AND DEEP MARGIN, B4--LESION AND DEEP INFERIOR MARGIN CLOSEST TO TUMOR, B5--INFERIOR SUPERFICIAL MARGIN WITH LESION, B6--LESION AND SUPERFICIAL MARGIN (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), B7--SUPERFICIAL SUPERIOR MARGIN, B8--SUPERIOR DEEP MARGIN.  NOTE THAT B2 THROUGH B8 CONSTITUTE ONE FULL CROSS-SECTION OF THE LESION IN ITS GREATEST DIMENSION. B9--PERPENDICULAR LATERAL MARGIN, B1O--TISSUE FROM LATERAL ASPECT OF THE SPECIMEN, B11--TUMOR AND SUPERFICIAL MARGIN (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), B12--TUMOR (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL).S UUID:B3D6A0F7-5E3C-4921-8399-6458E5222CC5 TCGA-A2-A0YG-01A-PR Redacted
