B. RT BREAST SENTINEL NODE #1 C. RT BREAST SENTINEL NODE #2S D. RT BREAST MASTECTOMY RECEIVED IN FOUR PARTS. PART A: RECEIVED FRESH LABELED LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY, STITCH AT 12OO IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN MEASURING 15 X 14.5 X 4 CM IN GREASTEST DIMENSIONS. THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 6.3 X 3.6 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN IS MARKED BLUE WHILE THE DEEP ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS CENTRAL FIBROSIS WITH MULTIPLE CYSTIC AREAS CONTAINING GREY MUCINOUS FLUID. THIS AREA IS MEASURES 1O.5 X 9 X 3 CM AND IS SURROUNDED BY GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE YELLOW FATTY TISSUE. REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A1-NIPPLE; A2-CENTRAL DEEP MARGIN; A3-4 UPPER OUTER QUADRANT; A5-6 UPPER INNER QUADRANT; A7-8 LOWER INNER QUADRANT AND A9-1O-LOWER OUTER QUADRANT. PART B: RECEIVED FRESH LABELED SENTINEL NODE #1 HOT AND BLUE IS AN OVOID FRAGMENT OF BLUE COLORED TISSUE AND SURROUNDING YELLOW FAT MEASURING 2 X 1 X 1 CM. SECTIONING REVEALS A GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE BLUE DYED NODE MEASURING 1.7 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. A PORTION IS TAKEN PER PROTOCOL AND THE REMAINDER IS SUBMITTED LABELED B. PART C: RECEIVED FRESH LABELED SENTINEL NODE #2 HOT IS AN OVOID PORTION OF YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 2 X 1 X 1 CM. SECTIONING REVEALS UNREMARKABLE NODAL TISSUE SUBMITTED ENTIRELY LABELED C. PART D: RECEIVED FRESH LABELED RIGHT BREAST MASTECTOMY,S STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN MEASURING 17 X 15 X 5.0 CM. THE NIPPLE IS GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 6 X 3 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED IN BLUE INK.  THE DEEP MARGIN IS MARKED IN BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS A FIRM FIBROUS NODULE IN THE UPPER INNER QUADRANT MEASURING 2.5 X 1.5 X 1.5 CM. THE LESION GROSSLY EXTENDS TO WITHIN O.8 CM OF THE MOST MEDIAL MARGIN AND IS 0.7 CM FROM BOTH THE SUPERFICIAL AND DEEP MARGINS.  THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE BREAST CONSISTS OF DENSE FIBROUS TISSUE WITH NUMEROUS CYSTIC AREAS AND THIS SURROUNDED BY BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE.  THE CENTRAL AREA MEASURES 13 X 10.5 X 3.0 CM.

MINOR FOCI OF MICROPAPILLARY-TYPE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU ARE PRESENT, BUT OVER 90t OF THE TUMOR IS INVASIVE.  THE TUMOR IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER INNER 5r.2. QUADRANT OF THE BREAST (2 O'CLOCK POSITION) WITH A MICROSCOPIC TENDRIL OF 0% TUMOR EXTENDING TO THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN (SLIDE D3). THE MEDIAL MARGIN Dcis IS FREE OF TUMOR BY A DISTANCE OF 5 MM AND THE DEEP MARGIN BY miuro pap APPROXIMATELY 1 CM. REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS OF BREAST TISSUE AWAY FROM THE PRIMARY TUMOR SITE SHOW PROLIFERATIVE FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH AREAS OF MARKED INTRADUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA PRESENT, BUT NO ADDITIONAL AREAS OF MALIGNANCY.
