"Left kidney and adrenal gland (freeze mass)II. consists of a radical nephreclomy specimen measuring 21.0 x 13.0 x 9.0 cm and weighing 1250 grams total.  There is a 11.0 x 0.5.  x 0.5 cm segment of ureler attached. The specimen is inked black and opened to show the kidney measuring 12.0 x 8.0 x 6.0 cm Thore is a 8.0 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm multinodular yellow mass in the corlex extonding into tho perironal fat..  There are also mulliple black firm nodules in the perirenal fat, measuring up to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Adjacent to the mass is a 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm area of kidney,whichis mottled in appearance The remainder of the kidney. pelvis and renal vein are grossly unremarkable without. tunor.
