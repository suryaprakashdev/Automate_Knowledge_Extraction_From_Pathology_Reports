ICD o-3 Ca cinsno, Isludor irfuststirey D 8520Yi JJ 4/2/) 3 UUID:4C3E3E5B-E24E-447B-A688-68D6EBE15A9F TCGA-AR-A50M-01A-PR Redacted Breast, left, wide local excision: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 2/3; Nottingham score 7/9], forming a mass (4.7 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm) [AJCC pT2]. Lobular carcinoma in situ is present. Biopsy site changes are present. Angiolymphatic invasion is not identified. Calcifications are identified in benign ducts. All surgical resection margins, after re-excision of the superomedial margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.8 cm, deep margin). Multiple (4) left breast intramammary Iymph nodes are negative for tumor. Breast, left "palpable" nodule, excision: A single left breast intramammary lymph node is negative for tumor. Lymph node, left intramammary sentinel, excision: A single left intramammary sentinel lymph node is positive for isolated tumor cells [AJCC pN0 (i+) (sn)]. These isolated tumor cells are seen on cytokeratin immunostaining only. Blue dye is identified. Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel, No. 1 and No. 2, biopsy: Multiple (3) left axillary sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN0 (i-) (sn)]. Blue dye is not identified in any of the three left axillary sentinel lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression. Breast, right, wide local excision: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 2/3; Nottingham score 7/9], forming a mass (1.4 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm) [AJCC pT1c]. Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, low to intermediate nuclear grade, present within (greater than 25%) and outside the invasive component (over an area 1.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm) which extends anteriorly from the invasive tumor. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. Biopsy site changes are present. All surgical resection margins, after re-excision of the anterior/medial margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.9 cm, deep margin). A radioactive seed is identified. Lymph nodes, right axillary, dissection: Multiple (4 of 25) right axillary lymph nodes are positive for metastatic breast carcinoma [AJCC pN2]. The largest metastatic focus is a collection of matted lymph nodes that measure 3.0 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm. Faxitron done. Case seen in consultation with Rj husst
