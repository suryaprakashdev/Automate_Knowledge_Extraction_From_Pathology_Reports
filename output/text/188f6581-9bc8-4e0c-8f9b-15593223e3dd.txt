SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT 1.0 cm in length and0.5 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 1.0 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter.The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable.An adrenal gland is identified,measuring 4.Ox1.Ox1.0 cm.The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a large necrotic mass, completely replacing the entire kidney with rim normal renal parenchyma in the hilar area and measuring 13x12x10cm.Tumor thrombus is identified in the renal vein,but the margin is free of tumor.The renal cortex measures 0.5 cm in thickness and the calyces appear involved by the tumor.The specimen is photographed. Representative sections are submitted for and for permanent sections. Summary of sections: UVM--ureteral and vessel margins Ttumor TH-tumor in the hilar area TK--tumor with adjacent kidney Thr-tumor thrombus K--representative sections kidney AD-adrenal gland HF-hilar fat 2).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled Para-aortic nodes" and consists of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.6 to 3 cm in greatest dimension.All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections LN--lymph nodes BLN--bisected lymph nodes 3).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled Pre-aortic nodes" and consists of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.6 to2.6 cm in greatest dimension.All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN--lymph nodes BLN--bisected lymph nodes 4).The specimen is received in formalin,labeled "Interaortocaval lymph node" and consists of two pink tan firm lymph nodes measuring from 0.8 and 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN--lymph nodes BLN--bisected lymph node 5).The specimen is received in formalin,labeled "Suprahilar nodes and portion of left adrenal" and consists of a piece of brown tan fibrous adipose tissue measuring 6 x2.7 x 1.3 cm.Multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes are isolated ranging from 1 to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. All identified lymph nodes are submitted.A golden yellow portion of adrenal gland is identified measuring 3.5 x 2.2 x 1cm.Serial sections of the gland reveal a homogeneous golden yellow parenchyma and is entirely submitted.
