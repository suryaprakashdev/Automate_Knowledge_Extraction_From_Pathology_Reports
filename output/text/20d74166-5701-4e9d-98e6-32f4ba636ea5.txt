FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT Source of Specimen: A.Whipple B. Left tube, ovary, uterus, and right adnexal mass C.Appendix D.Gallbladder E. Ovary and fallopian tube;right Intraoperative Diagnosis: A.Whipple procedure:Pancreatic mass, pelvic mass:FSA1) pancreatic margin negative.FSA2) Bile duct margin negative. The intraoperative interpretation(s) was/were performed and rendered at B. FS: Left tube, ovary, uterus and right adnexal mass: Favor leiomyoma The intraoperative interpretation(s) was/were performed and rendered at Gross Description: A. The specimen received at this time previously designated as #3, now designated as part A Whipple procedure. Initially received in a fresh state for frozen section analysis is a generous portion of tissue consistent with a Whipple procedure, consisting of a 10.3 cm distal portion of gastric tissue,4.5 cm in diameter at the proximal margin of resection, a 17.5 x 3.2 cm fragment of small bowel, and the head pancreas measuring:3.4 cm in length,4.8 cm superior-inferior, and 4.3 cm anterior surface to posterior uncinate margin.The common bile duct extends 0.7 cm, and is 1.2 cm in diameter,with the dilated 0.6 cm lumen involved with a metallic mesh stent. The surface of the pancreas is now differentially inked as follows: anterior-yellow, inferior-green, posterior uncinate-black, superior-blue, pancreatic notch/medial surface-red.The gastric and small bowel serosa demonstrates a glistening hyperemic appearance.The length of gastrointestinal tissue is now opened to reveal luminal contents of blood tinged mucinous fluid, that is cleared to reveal erythematous pink and tan gastric mucosa, with the small bowel circular plicae prominent, semi-congested distally, to light pink and tan.At 3.5 cm distal to the pylorus is a 0.2 cm unremarkable ductal orifice that is probe patent with the pancreatic duct through the distal margin. This ductal tract perpendicularly bypasses the common bile duct without involving the CBD lumen.At 1.1 cm distal to the pancreatic duct orifice, or 4.6 cm distal to the pylorus and 12.9 cm from the distal small bowel margin resection, a prominent ampulla, with a 1.0 cm Iumen, demonstrates obvious communication with the common bile duct and involved with a metallic mesh stent. The stent is sectioned lengthwise and removed, revealing a waffled-granular, deep red

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT congested mucosa. The small bowel periphery of the ampulla is raised, semi-congested and granular, over an area of 2.2 x 1.5 cm, with the immediate transition in the common bile duct suspiciously raised The pancreatic margin and the common bile duct margin are now shaved and submitted for frozen section analysis, with residual frozen tissue submitted for permanent sections. Sectioning through the pancreas, medial and posterior to the common bile duct tract, demonstrates diffusely dense, light gray cut surface,with mucin filled spaces up to 0.2 cm, grossly suspicious for malignant change. These changes grossly approach within 0.1 cm of the posterior margin of the uncinate and 0.1 cm of the superior-medial inked surfaces.This possible mass lesion is up to 3.1 x 1.8 cm.The remaining cut sections of the pancreas toward the anterior surface and distal margin of resection demonstrates tan, lobular, glandular parenchyma, grossly uninvolved with tumor, with exception of a 0.6 cm focus, suspicious for tumor involvement near the pancreatic groove periphery, and within 0.9 cm of the pancreatic distal margin of resection (A11). Examination of the peripancreatic fat reveals thirteen Iymph node candidates ranging from 0.3 cm to 1.4 x 0.9 cm. Examination of the discrete portion of perigastric fat reveals two lymph node candidates, 0.3 and 0.4 cm each. Representative sections are submitted including entire submission of lymph node tissue candidacy.

B.Part B designated left tube, ovary,uterus, and right adnexa mass - stitch. Initially received in a fresh state for frozen section analysis is a supercervical hysterectomy specimen with attached left fallopian tube segment and ovary, and right adnexal mass. The right adnexal mass measures 4.5 x 3.7 x 3.5 cm and is encapsulated and partially glistening pink-red soft tissue. Sectioning reveals an encapsulated -well circumscribed rubbery, yellow-tan nodular cut surface, with a faint whorled appearance, grossly consistent with a leiomyoma. Two representative sections are submitted for frozen section analysis with residual frozen tissue submitted in B1 for permanent sections. The right fallopian tube segment and ovary is not appreciated, nor placed within the container, and the left adnexal tissue is now removed, to demonstrate a 74 gram uterine corpus including attached "right adnexal mass" measuring 5.7 cm superior to inferior, 4.5 cm cornu to cornu and 2.4 cm posterior-anterior. The uterine serosa is partially glistening light pink to congested deep purple-red. The uterine corpus is now bisected, revealing a triangular endometrium, 1.9 cm cornu to cornu and 3.0 cm in length, flattened light tan to focally congested deep red, and 0.1 cm in thickness.The dome of the fundus demonstrates an additional circumscribed whorled appearing nodular

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT mass, 2.4 x 2.2 cm. The myometrium is rubbery semi-congested pink and tan and includes an additional 0.4 and 1.3 cm whorled appearing and somewhat degenerated yellow-gray nodules.. The left fallopian tube segment with fimbria is 4.7 x 0.4 cm congested deep red, with a delicate light tan lumen. The attached ovary is glistening bosselated pink-yellow, 2.4 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm. The ovary is partially cinched by a black suture, removed and the ovary is sectioned to demonstrate a soft to rubbery grossly atrophic pink and yellow-gray cut surface. Examination of the cinched area demonstrated increased indurated changes, including a 0.3 cm cyst, this area is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation. The remaining cut sections of the ovary reveal discrete nodularity or grossly unusual areas of change suggestive of neoplasia.Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: B1) frozen section, "right adnexal mas", B2) cervical stump/distal margin of lower uterine segment, B3-B4) endomyometrium,including smallest nodularity,B5) large nodular mass and dome of fundus, second larger intramural mass represented, three pieces total, B6-B7) additional representation of large right adnexal mass, including surrounding margins, six pieces, B8) left fallopian tube and ovary represented. C. Part C designated appendix. Received is a container initially designated as part 1 appendix and part 2 gallbladder, includes a vermiform appendix, 7.0 cm in length, and 0.6 cm in diameter. The serosa is hyperemic pink and tan. Sectioning demonstrates a lumen dilated up to 0.4 cm containing loose green fecal matter.The apex demonstrates stenosis of lumen, thickened yellow-gray appearance. omission of the apex, bisected, mid length, and Representative sections are submitted to include entire proximal margin of resection represented (blue) in C1. D. Part D designated gallbladder. Received in formalin is a container formally designated as #1 appendix and #2 gallbladder, is a gallbladder, 7.0 x 2.6 x 1.5 cm.The serosa is glistening lightly fatty congested purple-red. The bile duct margin is received opened, demonstrating an obvious patent 0.3 cm lumen exuding hemorrhagic mucin. Examination of the attached fat near the cystic duct margin does not reveal Iymph node content. The wall is 0.2 to 0.4 cm including serosal fat, and the lumen includes hemorrhagic mucin and blood clot, without calculi. The material is cleared to reveal velvety congested deep red mucosa with a few raised yellow flecks. No grossly unusual areas of change suggestive of neoplasia. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation in D1 E. Part E designated as right tube and ovary.Received in formalin is a 6 gram portion of adnexal tissue, that includes a 4.0 x 0.3 cm fallopian tube segment with fimbria, and an attached 2.4 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm.The fallopian tube is hyperemic pink and tan, with a delicate light tan lumen. Sectioning through the ovary demonstrates a soft to rubbery semi-congested pink and yellow-gray, grossly atrophic parenchyma. No discrete nodularity or grossly unusual areas of change suggestive of neoplasia.Representative sections are submitted, to include entire submission of the ovary, and representation of the fallopian tube in E1 and E2 Microscopic Description: A.Microscopic sections have been examined.The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered.
