Icd- u - > bnfiltrati`Ng duct, NU5 850v|3 Palieni hisiry: Carcn mi. The patient is a tw PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer.. POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same. c50.3 PROCEDURE: Left total mastectomy. . CQCF: bunst,Nvs L5D.9 ADDENDA: Addendum Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed on block 1D using the DNA probe for Her-2/neu gene. The ratio of Her-2/neu gene signals to chromosome 17 centromere signals was determined to be 2.05. Therefore, the interpretation is:  borderline amplification of the Her-2ineu gene. UUID:D24BB508-6E9A-4CF7-93C6-975E79F6E86D TCGA-BH-A18P-01A-PR Redacted My signature is attestation that ! have personally reviewed the submitted materia vove dlagnosis reflects that evaluation Addendum ESTrOGen/prOgeSterONe AND hER-2ineU REPORt Using appropriate positive and negative controls, the test for the presence of these hormone receptor proteins is. performed by the immunoperoxidase method, and reported according to the ' consensus statement on adjuvant. therapy for breast cancer, oty A positive ER or PR tumor shows any nuclear immunostaining, and is  semiquantitated as indicated below. Result Semiquantitative Statement ER positive Percent cells staining as: (0 95%; 1+ 5%, 2+ 0%, 3+ 0%)  PR negative Percent cells staining as: (0 100%, 1+ 0%, 2+ 0%, 3+ 0%) HER-2/NeU DAKO hERCEPTEST: A WEAK TO MODERATE COMPLETE mEMBRANE STAInInG IS OBSERVED IN mORE tuan 10% OF THE TUMOR CELLS. hER-2/NEU iS iNTERPRETEO AS WEAKLY POSITIVE ISCORE 2+l. NOTE: Her-2/Neu FISH was ordered and will be subsequently reported. The Her-2/neu and estrogen/progesterone receptor assays were performed with FDA approved methods. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Part 1: teft Breast, total. mastectomy - A.-tNFILTRATiNG DUCTAL CARCINOMA, 2.0 CM, nOTTiNGhAm SCORE 7/9 (tubules 3, nuclei 2, mitosis 2), TOcaTed in tHe LoWeR inner qUaDrANt And exTenDInG tO the Lower Outer quaDrant. TUmOR COMES TO WITHIN O.1 CM FROM THe inNER LOWER Of QUADRAnT MARGIN. C.  MICROCALCIFICATION ASSOCIATED WITH TUMOR. D. DUCTAL CARCInOMA IN SITU, nUCLEAR GRADE 2, SOLID TYPE WITH COMEDO NECROSIS, REPRESENTING 10-15% Of THE TUMOR VOLUmE. E. MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR. F.  REMAINING BREAST TISSUE WITH FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES, SCLEROSiNG ADENOSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATION. G. SKIN AND NIPPLE NOT REMARKABLE. H.  Three lymph nodes negative for tumor. PaRt 2: LEft AXILLA, SenTinel Lymph nOde #1, EXcISiOnal BIOpsy -  One Lymph nOde negaTIve fOr TumOR, COnfIRmed by negativE AE1/ae3 immunOstain. PArt 3: Left AXIlLA, Sentinel Lymph nODe #2, EXcisiOnal BIOpsy : ONe LyMPH NODe NEGATIVE fOR TUMOR, CONFIRMED BY NEGATIVE AE1/AE3 immUNOSTAIN. COMMENT: Estrogen and Progesterone receptors and HER-2/Neu will be performed on block 1D and the result will follow in a. separate report.
