Sigmoid colon, segmental resection: Adenocarcinoma. -Histologic grade: Moderately to poorly differentiated. -Tumor size: 6.3 cm in greatest dimension. -Tumor extension: Tumor penetrates muscularis propria and extends into pericolonic fat. -Lymph-vascular invasion: Definite lymph-vascular invasion is not identified. -Perineural invasion: Present, focal. -Surgical margins:  Proximal and distal margins negative for neoplasm. Radial margin negative for neoplasm. Mesenteric vascular margin negative for neoplasm. -Closest surgical margin: Proximal. Tumor comes to within 5.3 cm. -Lymph nodes: Thirteen (13) of thirteen (13) lymph nodes negative for neoplasm (0/13). AJCC pathologic stage: pT3,N0 STAge eA IIA Geade 2-3 Clinical Information Colon cancer. Gross Description "A. Superior hemorrhoidal lymph node." Received is a 0.5 cm lymph node with attached fat. "A." all "B, Sigmoid colon." Received Is an 18.8 crn segment of colon with attached pericolonic fat. There is a stitch attached to one. end of the specimen which is designated as proximal. The proximal margin will be inked orange. There is a 6.3 x 5.8 cm full circumferential ulcerated mass on the mucosa which is 5.3 cm from the proximal margin. There is black ink on the radial margin adjacent to the mass. The mass grossly appears to extend through the ful thickness of the wall of the colon and to. involve the adjacent pericolonic fat. No other masses or lesions are grossly identified on the remaining mucosa. There is a. vascular pedicle identified on the per icolonic fat. The mass grossly appears to come within 3.8 cm of the pedicle. The margin of the pedicie will be shaved and submitted. On sectioning the pericolonic fat, there are 11 possible lymph nodes ranging from. 0.4-0.8 cm. *B1." proximal and distal margins and vascuiar pedicle margin; "82-B4," random sections mass; "B5." possible regional lymph node; "86." possible lymph nodes remaining pericolonic fat ary Tumor Site Discrepan ase is (circle)
