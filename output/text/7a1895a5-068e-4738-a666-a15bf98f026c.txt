HATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATON OF THE SLIDES ANDIOR OIHER MATERIAL), AND IHAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORI Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment CK7 CA-1X. RACEMASE E-CADHERIN CD117 NEG CONT IMM RECUT Gross Description:. 1).The specinen is received fresh for. mrenal mass.It consists of a 6.0 x 5.0 x 2.8 cm wedge shaped  portion of kidney wih a suture marking the deop margin. The margin is inked black and the specimen is serially seclioned lo. reveal a 3.8 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The clearance from the reseclion margin is 0.1 cm. A representalive section of the nearest margin is. subniltod for frozen section diagnosis. Representatively submilted. Portions of the tumor are submilted for TPS. Summary of sections. FSC - trozen seclion control. T-tumor RS - representative sections. 2). The specimen is recoived fresh. laboled leff kidney" and consists of a kidnoy with altached ureter. renal vessols and. perinephric fat weighing 162 g in total.. The kidney measures 12.0 x 5.5 x 3,4 cm.  The attached ureter measures 8.0 cm in length. and 0.2 cm in diameler. The attached renal vein measures 1.5 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter.
