Cytogenetics Report: Status: Signed Out Cytogenetics Case Number: Karyotype: 46,xx,t(3;6)(q27;q15)[4]/46,xx{16] Interpretation: This is a tumor from the left eye of a patient with ocular melanoma. Cytogenetic analysis of this sample shows an abnormal clone of cells with a translocation between chromosomes 3 and 6. The most common recurring abnormalities seen in uveal melanomas are nonrandom changes of chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8. More specifically, deletions of 1p, monosomy for chromosome 3, gains of 6p, losses of 6q, and i(8q). Structural rearrangements of chromosomes 3 are rare in uveal melanomas, most often seen with unbalanced translocations resulting in deletions of 3q. The significance of the. rearrangement of chromosomes 3 and 6 in this sample is not known.. Ref: K. Sisley "Tumors of the Eye", in Cancer Cytogenetics, 3rd Edition, S Heim & F Mitelman eds, wiley-Blackwell, 2009, 62l-640. ***Electronically Signed Out By*** MD --MICROSCOPIC: - Specimen A shows sections of a globe with a large choroidal tumor (l.5cm diameter and 1.4 cm height) composed predominantly of a cohesive spindle cell proliferation. Focal areas with cells having an epithelioid appearance are also noted. Mitotic figures are rare. The tumor is partially pigmented.The ciliary body is not involved by the tumor. Also, scleral or extrascleral extension is not identified. The optic nerve is not observed Page 2 of 5

Specimen B shows a vascular channel not involved by malignant melanoma. --SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED:- A: Eye, enucleation B: Neuropathology, BX, NOs ---GROSS DESCRIPTION:--- The specimens are received in two properly labeled containers with the. patient' s name and accession number. A. The specimen is designated "enucleated left eye" and consists. of a 2.8 x 2.4 x 2.6 cm globe with a clear cornea measuring 1.1 x 1.0 cm in diameter. The optic nerve stump is 0.2 cm in length. The specimen is. trisected revealing a brown-black, partially fragmented mass measuring 1.5 cm in maximum diameter and 1.4 cm in maximum height. The mass is in the inferior aspect of the posterior chamber. RS 2 Summary of Cassettes: Al, lower calotte with tumor; A2, central eye slab B. The specimen is designated "vortex vein left eye" and consists. of a 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.05 cm portion of tan-red soft tissue. TE 1.
