GRSS DESCRIPTION: A. . APILLOMA MEDIAL LEFT BREAST Received fresh/in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "papilloma medial left breast" is an oriented (single anterior, double lateral, triple superior), previously inked, 14 g, 4.3 x 3.2 x 2.1 cm needle localized excision. Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing firm, focally hemorrhagic breast parenchyma. No lesions or nodules are grossly appreciated.

B. EXCISION LEFT BREAST CANCER Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "excision left breast cancer" is an oriented (triple - superior, double - lateral, single - anterior), 46 g, (Medial to lateral - 6.5 cm, superior to inferior - 5.4 cm, anterior to posterior - 3.5 cm) lumpectomy specimen. (The specimen is previously inked) Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 9 slices revealing a 2.3 x 2.1 x 2 cm, tan- white to tan-pink, firm to hard mass that is closest to the posterior margin at 0.2 cm, in. slices 6 to 9. Tissue is procured. Representatively submitted in 18 cassettes as per the attached diagram: B1: slice 1 entire, perpendicular sections of the medial margin B2: slice 2, representative anterior margin B3: slice 3, representative posterior margin with the mass. B4-B5: slice 4, sections of the mass showing the closest posterior margin, B6-B7: slice 5, mass with anterior and posterior margins B8: slice 5, superior margin B9-B10: slice 6, mass with anterior and posterior margins. B11: slice 6, inferior margin B12-B13: slice 6, superior margin B14-B15: slice 7, representative anterior and key and posterior margins. B16: slice 8, posterior margin B17-B18: slice 9, lateral margin, perpendicular sections.. C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA Received in formalin with the patient's identification and designated "sentinel lymph node #1 left axilla" is a 3.2 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm fibrofatty tissue within which 2 lymph nodes, 2 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm and 2.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm are identified. The lymph nodes are serially sectioned and entirely submitted in 2 cassettes, C1-C2. D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA Received in formalin with the patient's identification and designated "sentinel lymph node #2 left axilla" is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm fibrofatty tissue within which 2 lymph nodes,. 1.2 x 1 x 0.5 cm and 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm are identified.
