Tumor: Three distinct separate tumors are identified. The largest tumor occupies the left lateral wall and extends to include portions of both the. anterior and posterior wall. In some areas, the tumor appears to abut the inked posterior bladder surface. This tumor measures 4.5 x 3.6 cm. The central portlon of the tumor is rough, hemorrhagic, and somewhat shaggy and has a somewhat necrotic appearance. The necrosis involves 80% of the surface of the tumor. There are tan-gray, nodular, vlable areas at the peripheral margin of the tumor. On section, this tumor can be seen to deeply invade the bladder wall  and appears to have extended through the full thickness to invoive the adjacent periveslcular adipose tissue. The second tumor occuples a portion of the posterior wall and extends laterally to surround the right ureteral orifice. This tumor measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The tumor is largely exophytic extending 0.9 cm above the lining of the bladder wall. The third tumor occuples a portion of the Inferlor anterior bladder wall and measures 1.7 x 1.5 cim and rises 0.6 cm above the lining of the bladder wall. The lumen of the bladder contains a large volume of form friable blood clot. The clot measures 7.0 x 7.0 x 2.5 cm. Uninvoived mucosa: The invoived mucosa has a norma! tan-gray appearance with no additional lesions noted. Sectioning through the prostate reveals a norma! tan-gray, lobulated, spongy cut surface.. Prostate, seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia:. Ink code: Anterior: blue Posterior: black Right side: orange Left side: blue Section key: C1 en face urethral resection margins. C2 largest tumor of left lateral wall, anterior surface C3 C8 largest tumor of left laterat wall and posterior surface C9, C10 second tumor of right lateral wall C11, C12 third tumor anteror wall. C13 left ureteral orifice C14 right ureteral orifice C15 right lateral wall C16 section of dome C17 C19 right prostate submitted distal to proximal C20 C22 left prostate submitted distal to proximal C23 right seminal vesicle and vas deferens. C24 teft seminal vesicle and vas deferens Specimen D is received in formalin labeled with the patlent's name and designated "right ilac lymph node". The specimen consists of an aggregate of yellow, fatty tissue measuring 5.0 x 4.3 x 2.5 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.5 cm up to 2.1 cm in greatest dimension. Section key: The lymph nodes are entirely submltted as follows: D1, D2 largest lymph node trisected D3 two lymph nodes, bisected, one marked with ink  D4 two lymph nodes, bisected, one marked with ink Specimen E is received In formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated "right obturator lymph node". The specimen consists of an aggregate of yellow, fatty tissue measuring 5.5 x 3.8 x 2.0 cm. Three lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.8 cm up to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. Section key: The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: E1 E3 largest lymph node trisected. E4, E5 one lymph node, bisected. E6 one single lymph node Specimen F is recelved in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated *left iliac lymph node". The specimen consists of an aggregate of yellow, fatty tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Three lymph nodes are Page 4 of 7
