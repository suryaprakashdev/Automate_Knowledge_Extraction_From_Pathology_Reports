Surgical Pathology Report Clinical Diagnosis and History:. ear old female with left invasive CA/DCIS ? extensive DCIS 12-1:00 cT1,cNo,cMo clinical stage I Tissue(s) Submitted: 1: LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODES #1 2: LEFT AXILLARY PALPABLE LYMPH NODES 3: LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 4: LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 5: LEFT TOTAL MASTECTOMY SUTURE IN AXILLARY TAIL Gross Description: Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left axillary sentinel lymph nodes, and consists of three lymph. nodes with attached fat, ranging from 0.2 cm to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety for permanent microscopy as follows:. 1A: two lymph nodes 1B:  one lymph node serially sectioned. Specimen #2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left axillary palpable lymph nodes, and consists of four lymph nodes, ranging from 0.8 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are serially sectioned to reveal predominantly pink. tan cut surfaces, one of which displays a white focus. A smear preparation from the lymph node with the white focus is performed. The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety for permanent microscopy as follows: 2A-D:  one lymph node per cassette. Specimen#3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left axillary lymph node, sentinel #2, and consists of one, 0.9 cm lymph node, which is serially sectioned and submitted in its entirety labeled 3A. Specimen #4 is received in formalin labeled left axillary sentinel lymph node #3, and consists of six lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected and the lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety as follows: 4A: five lymph nodes 4B: one lymph node, bisected. Specimen #5 is received fresh labeled left total mastectomy, suture in axillary tail, and consists of an 858 gm, 25 x 23 x 5 cm left total mastectomy specimen, with a suture marking the axillary tail. There is a 24 x 17 cm, ovoid to elliptical portion of brown skin on the anterior aspect, displaying a 2 x 2 x 1 cm everted nipple. The skin displays multiple brown-black, flat to raised,. predominantly keratotic skin lesions, ranging from 0.1 cm to 1.0 cm and 0.6 to 0.2 cm. The largest lesion is located at 12 o'clock,. 1.7 cm from the nearest 12 o'clock margins. One of the smaller lesions appears to be transected at the 5 o'clock margin. The specimen is inked as follows: superoanterior -- blue, inferoanterior -- green, posterior -- black. The posterior margin is intact. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 1.6 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm tan-white, ovoid, lobulated, indurated mass located retroareolar, 6 cm from the deep margin and 3 cm from the overlying skin. Sectioning of the mass reveals a clip. Anterior to the mass is some dense. fibrosis, displaying possible comedonecrosis. Sectioning of the remaining tibrous tissue reveals a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm rubbery, but stellate area of fibrosis at 1-2 o'clock, 11 cm trom the nipple. Sectioning of this area reveals a clip. The clip is located 3 cm from the deep margin, and 6.5 cm from the overlying skin. No definitive gross tumor is associated with this clip. The remaining breast. parenchyma consists of approximately 90% yellow, lobulated adipose tissue, and 10% scattered white, rubbery fibrous tissue. A small portion of tumor and normal are submitted for TCGA studies. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 5A: nipple 5B-5D: mass with clip, no margin. 5E-5G:  representative tibrous tissue anterior to mass, no margin 5H: representative deep margin to mass 5I-5K: stellate area of fibrosis with clip 5L: posterior margin and anterior skin to stellate area of fibrosis with clip 5M-5O: representative fibrous tissue at 12-1 o'clock 5P: representative upper inner quadrant 5Q: representative lower inner quadrant 5R: representative lower outer quadrant 5S: representative upper outer quadrant 5T: representative margin in second largest skin lesion 5U: representative medium five skin lesions 5V: representative smaller skin lesions Time in formalin: 1 p.m, submitted same day Page 2 of 3
