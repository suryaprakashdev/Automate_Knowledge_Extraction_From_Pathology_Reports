Surgical Pathology - Working Draft - Resection margins for ductal carcinoma in situ: Widely clear (see above for invasive tumor.. - Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCis): Not identified.. - Number of lobules involved: N/A. - Nuclear type/size: N/A.. - Resection margins for pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ: N/A. - Lymph node status: Negative. - Number of positive lymph nodes: 0. - Total number sampled: 2. - AJCC/UICC stage: pT2N0Mx. - Nontumorous breast tissue: Non-proliferative fibrocystic change; duct ectasia. - Nipple: Unremarkable.. - Skin/dermis: Unremarkable. Pagetoid spread of carcinoma is seen in benign ducts adjacent to the tumor. No such spread is seen away from the tumor. Atypical lobular hyperplasia is present in the contralateral (right) breast.. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed on block c3. The test for estrogen receptors is positve. There is moderate nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is moderate to strong nuclear staining in 90% of. tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive.. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression.. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of O or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FisH testing, and almost always show gene amplification.

Parts A through I are received fresh, and Part J is received in formalin. Part A, additionally labeled "1 consists of one pink, unoriented, fibroadipose tissue fragment measuring 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 1, and subsequently submitted in cassette A1. Part B, additionally labeled consists of one pink-red, unoriented fibroadipose tissue fragment measuring 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in cassette B1. Part C is additionally labeled " It consists of a mastectomy specimen, measuring 15.8 cm from superior to inferior, 15.6 cm from medial to lateral, and 8.2 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen weighs 442.5 gm. In the lateral aspect of the specimen is a spiculated, firm, tan mass, measuring 2.4 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm. This mass is 2.0 cm from the deep margin, 5.5 cm from the superior margin, >6 cm from the inferior margin, 2.8 cm from the lateral margin, and >6 cm from the medial margin. In the anterior-inferior portion of the breast, there are dilated ducts, filled with cheesy material This area is O.2 cm from the deep margin. The remainder of the breast parenchyma is unremarkable. Two pieces of tumor are banked, one for tissue banking and one for the epithelial cell study. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette C1: Nipple. Cassettes C2-C3: Spiculated mass. Cassette C4: Deep margin beneath tumor. Cassette C5: Lateral margin. Cassette C6: Lower outer quadrant. Cassette C7: Lower inner quadrant. Cassette C8: Medial margin.

Part D is additionally labeled It consists of a mastectomy specimen, measuring 18.2 cm from superior to inferior, 16.2 cm from medial to lateral, and 4.8 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen weighs 688 gm. A short stitch is designated by the surgeon as superior, and a long stitch is designated by the surgeon as lateral. In the inferior-medial portion of the specimen is a fragment of skin, measuring 7.5 x 4.9 cm. It is white and unremarkable. There is a nipple, measuring 1.3 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm. The specimen is notable for dilated ducts with a viscous, yellow-tan material within them. This material extends into one of the nipple ducts. No masses are noted, nor are any areas suspicious for DCIS appreciated. The anterior-superior portion of the specimen is inked blue, the anterior-inferior portion of the specimen is inked green, and the posterior aspect of the specimen is inked black. Multiple sections of unremarkable breast parenchyma are taken for two studies, including a high-risk study and an epithelial cell study. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassettes D1-D2: Nipple and surrounding skin. Cassette D3: Representative section of anterior-inferior breast with dilated duct. Cassette D4: Representative section of lower inner breast with dilated ducts. Cassette D5: Representative section of upper inner breast. Cassette D6: Representative section of medial breast. Cassette D7: Representative section of upper outer breast. Cassette D8: Representative section of upper inner breast. Cassette D9: Representative section of lateral breast. Part E is additionally labeled " It consists of a single irregular fragment of soft, yellow tissue, measuring 5.4 x 3.8 x 1.5 cm. A suture has been placed on one aspect of the specimen and is designated the new margin. That aspect of the specimen is inked black, and the specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes E1 through E5. Part F is received fresh labeled, It consists of an Page 4 of 12
