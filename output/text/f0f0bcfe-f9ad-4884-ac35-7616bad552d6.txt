Margins of resection (renal artery, renal vein, ureter, perinephric soft tissue), no tumor present. Adrenal gland, no tumor present.. (B) ANTERIOR AORTA, INTER-AORTOCAVAL LYMPH NODES Four lymph nodes, no tumor present. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT KiDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND AND PERIAORTIC MASS - A nephroureterectomy specimen (17.0 x 12.0 x 6.5 cm) including a kidney (11.5 x 6.5 x 7.0 cm), ureter (12.0 cm length, average diameter of 0.5 cm), and adrenal gland (5.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm), and attached perinephric fat (9.0 x 7.5 x 2.0 cm).. There is a well-circumscribed tumor (4.5 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm) in the mid portion of the kidney. The cut surface of the kidney  tumor is tan-white and homogeneous. The tumor extends to the perinephric fat and approaches the perinephric fat margin on the  posterior aspect of the specimen within 0.1 cm. The tumor does not appear to extend into the sinus. There is a perihilar lymph  node (8.0 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm) in the attached perinephric fat. Serial sectioning of the hilar lymph node shows a tan-white, firm and  homogeneous cut surface with focal area of hemorrhage and necrosis The uninvolved kidney is tan-brown and grossly unremarkable. The adrenal gland is grossly unremarkable. The remainder of the urothelium of the peivicalyceal system is grossly unremarkable.. Representative sections are submitted in A1-A21. Representative sample of the tumor is submitted for electron microscopy (on hold). INK CODE: Blue - retroperitoneal fat margin.  SECTION CODE: A1, vascular and ureter margin; A2, adrenal gland; A3, tumor and perirenal soft tissue; A4-A6, tumor  and renal sinus; A7-A12, tumor; A13-A18, representative sections of the perihilar lymph node; A19, A20, uninvolved kidney; A21, renal pelvis. (B) ANTERIOR AORTA INTER-AORTOCAVAL LYMPH NODES - An irregular fragment of adipose tissue (5.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm). Four lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 to 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm.. SECTION CODE: B1, B2, one lymph node serially sectioned; B3, three lymph nodes.. CLINICAL HISTORY None given.
