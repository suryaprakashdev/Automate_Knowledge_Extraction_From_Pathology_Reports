Due to the above HER-2/neu immunohistochemical staining result, gene copy level (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio) will be evaluated by FISH and a separate report will be issued. FOOTNOTE Estrogen receptor was assessed by immunohistochemistry using antibody 6F11 (* Progesterone receptor was assessed by immunohistochemistry using antibody PgR1294( HER-2/neu was assessed by immunohistochemistry using antibody AB8 t GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, LEFT AXILLA, IN VIVO 69, EX VIVO 55, BLUE - Two fragments of tissue including one Ivmph node measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.

Released by: Start of ADDENDUM ADDENDUM Addendum completed by ! SPECIMEN SOURCE Left breast SUMMARY Tissue section ot the invasive carcinoma 1 D6 was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the PathVysion HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu /CEP17 Slide adequacy is satistactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.67 copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.50 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by ) with this batch are appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION The tumor cells demonstrated no amplitication of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.11) The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing: Normal HER-2/neu levels: <1.80; Equivocal HER-2/neu leveis: 1.80 -- 2.20; Amplified HER-2/neu levels: >2.20 (Ref: Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43) NOTES

The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP 17 DNA probe is specitic tor the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of. Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1 -q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specitic uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration. Its system is operating within the performance specifications stated in the product  insert. Released by: --END OF REPORT--
