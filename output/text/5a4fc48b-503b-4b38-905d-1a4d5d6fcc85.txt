I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Blectronically Signed Out *** Gross Description: 1. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled "sentinel node number one, level 1, left axilla" and consists of a single submitted for frozen section consultation. Summary of sections: rsc-frozen section control 2).  The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled "sentinel node number two, level 1, left axilla" and consists of a single lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm, which is entirely submitted for frozen section consultation. Summary of sections:. FSC-frozen section control 3).  The specimen is received fresh labeled, "left breast, stitch marks axillary tail, ink margins" and consists of a breast measuring 17.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm.  Situated centrally on the skin surface is an everted nipple measuring 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm and areola measuring 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The skin is grossly unremarkable. suture demarcates the axillary aspect. The posterior surface of the breast A is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a firm from the deep margin, in the upper inner quadrant.  No additional lesions are identified. Tissue is given to Tps..  Sectioning of the axillary aspect Continued on next page **
