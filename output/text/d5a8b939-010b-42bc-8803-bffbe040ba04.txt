Result Narrativ SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Pre-Operative/Clinical History. Right renal mass Specimen(s) Received A: RIGHT KIDNEY MASS Gross Description. The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled right kidney mass:. Specimen type/procedure: Partial nephrectomy Laterality: Right. Description of specimen:. The specimen consists of a 25 gm, 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm partial nephrectomy. There is a thin Gerota' s fascia with multiple fibrous adhesions. The margins are inked as follows:. Margin of resection Black Gerota' s fascia Green. Adrenal gland:. Absent. Tumor site: Cortical. Tumor size: 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm. Tumor description: Well-circumscribed, bright yellow, focally. hemorrhagic solid mass..

Focality: Unifocal. Extent of invasion:. Tumor abuts Gerota' s fascia and the parenchymal margin of resection. Renal vessel involvement: Absent. Renal hilum: Uninvolved. Perinephric lymph nodes: Absent. Renal parenchymal lesions: None identified. Other: The mass encompasses approximately 90% of the. specimen. The uninvolved parenchyma shows the usual corticomedullary junction. Gross bench photographs are taken. Sections: (A1-A3) Mass and closest parenchymal margins of resection (A4, A5) Mass to include parenchymal margin and Gerota' s fascia. (A6) Mass and surrounding uninvolved parenchyma (A7) Uninvolved parenchyma. Microscopic Description Sections include kidney with a sharply circumscribed, partially encapsulated epithelial neoplasm. The neoplasm is characterized by a predominantly solid or. The predominant tumor cell is a small cuboidal cell with uniform, round, small bland nucleus and modest amounts of predominantly clear cytoplasm. There is a. second cell population present in the lumina of the tubules. The luminal population consists of larger polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a. single,  slightly enlarged oval to reniform nucleus with granular chromatin and a small nucleolus. The latter cells form intraluminal poorly cohesive sheets. There are scattered foci of foamy macrophages within the interstitium of the. tumor. Focally the tumor extends through its thin fibrous capsule and infiltrates into native renal parenchyma in a broad front. Focally tumor abuts. on an inked parenchymal resection margin (black ink, A2). In the histologic sections convincing extrarenal extension into perinephric soft tissue is not identified. A PAs stain is applied to sections of uninvolved nonneoplastic kidney (A7). It. demonstrates very focal mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with rare colocalized ischemic sclerotic glomeruli. The glomeruli are unremarkable.. Neither crescents nor mesangial proliferation nor primary glomerulopathy is Seen. Summary of Pathologic Findings Renal Carcinoma Operative procedure: Laparoscopic robotically assisted right partial nephrectomy. Tumor size: 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm. Laterality and focality: Unilateral, right kidney
