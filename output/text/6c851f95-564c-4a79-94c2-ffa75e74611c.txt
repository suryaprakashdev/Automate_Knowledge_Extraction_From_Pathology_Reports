FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATAS SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued) : Specimen #: AND AxILLARy cONTENTs" consists of 380 gram left mastectomy oriented with. single stitch medial, two stitches superior, stitch on highest axillary portion. Specimen measures 23 cm medial to lateral 15 cm superior to. inferior, 3 cm anterior to posterior. Attached skin ellipse displays a centrally located everted nipple measuring 1 cm. No discharge is. identified. No scars are identified.. There is a well-defined pink white firm gritty mass in the left outer. quadrant measuring 4.1 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. Tissue surrounding the mass is. remarkably nodular and firm with possible superior extension of primary lesion to approximately 5 cm (c4). Focal hemorrhage consistent with previous biopsy is also noted. Remaining quadrants are also composed of remarkably nodular focally indurated dense fibrous tissue. No additional masses identified. Fatty tissue comprises 20% of specimen and is unremarkable. The attached axillary tail measures 9 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. Sectioning reveals sixteen lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.. Sectioning of lowest lymph node shows a firm pink white cut surface with possible involvement by lesion.
