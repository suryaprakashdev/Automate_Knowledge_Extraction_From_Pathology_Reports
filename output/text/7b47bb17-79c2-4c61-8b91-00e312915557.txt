SPECIMEN: UUID:6D2FA4DD-285F-4815-9494-76B297FA04AF TCGA-PE-A5DE-01A-PR SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Redacted DOB: Sex: F Location: Date Collected: Icd-o-3 Date Received: Physician: Copy To: uyLelTa Liirg NoS 852s13 Clinical History/Diagnosis: Left breast cancer Dte DYusastNs S c3o 9 Source of Specimen(s): HJ 6Jx4/L3 1: Sentinel Nodes-left axilla 2: left breast lumpectomy 3: Margin-final medial Gross Description: Received in three parts. Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled # 1, "sentinel node left axilla" Touch Preparation Evaluation: 1TP- NO TUMOR SEEN PER (VERIFIED). Gross Description: Received fresh for intraoperative consultation/touch impression in a container labeled "sentinel node left axilla". It consists of a tan to light brown rubbery lymph node measuring 1.6 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. There is a stitch at one end marking the bluest portion. The node is sectioned. Touch impression of the bluest end was submitted as 1TPA and the tissue is subsequently submitted in 1A. Touch impression of the opposite end was submitted as 1TPB and subsequently the tissue is submitted in 1B. ********** ***************** Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled # 2, "left breast lumpectomy" Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled "left breast lumpectomy". It consists of a 7.4 x 7.4 x 3.5 cm ovoid rubbery fragment of fibroadipose tissue. There is a short stitch marking the superior and a long marking the lateral. The anterior is inked blue and the remaining margins are inked black. The specimen is. sectioned disclosing a large firm tan lesion with moderately defined borders measuring 3.8 x 2.6 x 1.9 cm. The lesion occupies an appreciable. amount of the lumpectomy specimen. Laterally in the tumor there is inspissated blood consistent with previous biopsy site changes. The lesion comes very close to the medial, superior, and anterior resection margins. Also adjacently the breast parenchyma is fibrous and there is a. 0.4 cm blue dome cyst noted. Representative sections are submitted in 2A-K. 3013

Designation of Sections: 2A-2C- breast tissue with tumor in relationship to anterior margin, 2D-2F- breast tissue with tumor in relationship to posterior margin, 2G- additional sections of tumor, no margins are represented with biopsy site, 2H- perpendicular sections of superior resection margin, 2I- perpendicular sections of medial resection margin [Note: specimen 3 presumably supercedes this margin.], 2J- perpendicular sections of inferior margin, 2K- perpendicular sections of lateral margin *********************************************************************** Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled # 3, "final medial margin" Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled " final medial margin". It consists of a fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. There is a stitch marking the final margin which is inked black prior to sectioning. Sections disclose no obvious residual lesional tissue. Entirely submitted in 3A and 3B. Final Diagnosis: 1. Sentinel lymph node, left axilla, excision: - One lymph node with no tumor seen (0/1). - Negative immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3. 2. Left breast, lumpectomy:. Invasive and in situ lobular carcinoma - Invasive lobular carcinoma, 3.8 cm in greatest dimension grossly, grade II-III. - Lobular carcinoma in situ, nuclear grade II-III, comprising approximately 5% of the tumor mass.. - Lymphovascular invasion is not identified. - Invasive carcinoma is less than 1mm to the inked closest medial margin (see specimen 3 for final medial margin status), and remaining margins with no tumor seen. - Changes consistent with prior biopsy site seen. - Non-neoplastic breast tissue shows fibrocystic changes with microcalcifications. 3. Left breast, final medial margin, excision: - Benign breast tissue, no tumor seen. Note: Case reviewed with. who concurs with the. diagnosis.
