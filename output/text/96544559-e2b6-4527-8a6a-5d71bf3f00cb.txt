*** Diagnosis / Diagnoses: *** Right hemicolectomy specimen with an ulcerated colon carcinoma conforming to the histological type of a moderately differentiated, partially mucus-producing, colorectal adenocarcinoma, located 3.5 cm aborally from  and almost circularly occupying the intestinal wall over a length of 4 cm. Invasive tumor spread within all layers of the intestinal wall and extending into the neighboring mesocolic fatty tissue Appendix with apparent post-inflammatory fibrosis of the wall. Oral and aboral resection margins and large omentum tumor-free. Seven of twenty-six lymph nodes with metastases from the colon carcinoma that are restricted to the lymph nodes. Remaining lymph nodes with uncharacteristic reactive changes. Tumor stage thus: pT3 pN2 (7/26), L0, V0; G2. Based on histological findings sent for information purposes (Examination no. not clearly legible, findings of. dermatopathological test laboratory,  there is a skin metastasis from an adenocarcinoma in a location that is not indicated. Based on the negative CK-20 results for the tumor cells, this is apparently not a skin metastasis from a colorectal carcinoma, but a skin metastasis from a primary tumor located elsewhere.n.
