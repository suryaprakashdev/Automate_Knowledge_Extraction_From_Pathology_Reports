CD-O-3 trocytoma,grodle III 9401/3 Clatscylere, anaplastie. 9451/3 Surgical Pathology Report Sute : Bain, eupaterleuil NsS 071.0 Patient Name: Phone #: Accession #: Med. Rec. #: Client: Taken: QpJ 7/q4113 DOB: (Age: ) Location: Received: Gender: F Accnt:  Reported: Physician(s): Phy Location: UUID:7FA0F0F7-F7B8-4127-988E-C3A43496CCCA Clinical History TCGA-DU-A6S7-01A-PR Redacted Brain tumor. Operative Diagnoses Operation / Specimen A: Brain, left frontal, craniotomy Pathologic Diagnosis A. Brain, left frontal, craniotomy: 1. Anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade 3 2. Negative for co-deletion of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q 3. Positive for IDH1-R132S mutation 4. Ki-67/ MIB1 proliferation index: up to approximately 10% See comment. Comment The diffuse astrocytoma has an area with up to 4 mitoses in 10 high power fields. There is no definite microvascular proliferation and no tumor necrosis identified in the initial and deeper sections. The immunostain for the  mutant IDH1-R132H protein is negative. A point mutation is detected in IDH1 by DNA sequencing (see) attached report). Overall, this diffuse glioma is consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade 3. ***Electronically Signed Out*** Senior Staff Pathologist Consultant: Senior Staff Pathologist Procedures/Addenda Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH) Date Ordered: Date Reported: Interpretation NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected. Surgical Pathology Page 2 of 4 Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S1592, D1S552, D19S219, D19S606, and D19S1182 Results-Comments Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A2). DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control. H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with D19S606 and

D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are. uninformative or otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion.. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the as required by CLiA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the detection of allelic loss. ***Electronically Signed Out*** Senior Staff Pathologist IDH1 Mutation Detection Assay Date Ordered: Date Reported: Interpretation POsirivE - There is evidence of IDH1 point mutation as indicated by the nucleotide change in codon 132 compared to the electropherogram of the reference normal sample (wild type).. The amino acid substitution is p.Arg132Ser Results-Comments TEST DESCRIPTION: IDH1/2 Mutation Analysis Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. -A1 H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. Mutation of IDH1 occurs early in glioma progression with somatic mutations of the R132 residue of IDH1 identified in majority (>70%) of grades Il and Ill astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, as well as in secondary GBMs that developed from these lower grade lesions. Mutation analysis of closely related IDH2 revealed mutations of IDH2 residue R172, with most mutations occurring in tumors lacking IDH1 mutations. Tumors with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations have distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors have a better outcome than those with wild type IDH genes.  Surgical Pathology Page 3 of 4 Mutations in IDH1/2 are detected by DNA sequencing procedures. The limit of detection of standard bidirectional sequencing is approximately 20-25%. In order to increase assay sensitivity tumor enrichment must be performed by manual microdissection when tumor cells in the block constitute less than 50% of nucleated cells FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
