Negative (0 ) Page 5of6 (0% of invasive tumor cells exhibit complete membranous staining; Uhiformity of staining: absent; Homogeneous, dark circumferential pattern: absent) Comment: Controls are satisfactory. FDA-approved rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (clone 4B5) directed against PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu is an the internal domain of the c-erbb-2 oncoprotein (Her2) for immunohistochemical detection of HeR2 protein overexpression in breast cancer tissue routinely processed for histologic evaluation. The Her2 test results are reported in accordance with the Asco/cAp guideline reconmendations for HeR2 testing in breast cancer (J clin Oncol 2007; 25(1):118-145). The ER and pR rabbit monoclonal antibodies are also FDA approved. 1.
