The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as "right marginal mandibulectomy", contains one piece of right floor of mouth mucosal tissue measuring 4.0 cm Sl x 3.0 cm ML x 5.5 cm AP. It includes a portion of upper posterior mandible body with 1 tooth. There is a tumor arising on the mucosal surface. The tumor measures 1.5 cm Sl x 1.5 cm ML x 1.8 cm AP. The tumor is elevated. There is no involvement of bone by the tumor. The turmor is located at 0.7 cm from the closest anterior margin. Remaining margins are as follows: Medial 1.0, posterior 1.8, lateral 1.8 cm respectively The resection margins are painted with silver nitrate. On sectioning, a small portion of gland measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm are included in the submucosa anterior-medial part of the specimen. Three pieces of tumor and three pieces of mucosa are taken by tissue bank. Representative sections are submitted as fotlows: 1A-1D mucosa with anterior margin, from lateral to medial. 1E-1l mucosa with medial margin, from anterior to posterior. 1J-1M mucosa with posterior margin, from medial to lateral. 1N-1P mucosa with lateral margin, from posterior to anterior. 1Q center of tumor with no margin. 1R mandible bone, anterior margin, en face. 1S, 1T mandible bone, closest to mucosal tumor. 1U mandible bone, posterior margin, en face. 2. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as "right anterior margin", contains one piece of mucosa tissue measuring 2.7 cm SI x 2.5 cm ML x 1.0 cm AP. It includes a portion of mandible bone with one tooth. The posterior resection margin of the this piece of mandibular bone matches the anterior resection margin of the mandibular bone of specimen 1. No tumor is identified in this specimen.. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 2A-2C mucosa submitted in total, all sagittal sections, from lateral to medial, with anterior margin painted with India ink 2D anterior margin of bone, en face Page 2 of 4
