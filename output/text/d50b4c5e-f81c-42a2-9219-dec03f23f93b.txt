 Page 2 of 3 1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon. The terminal ileum measures 6 cm in length and 3.5 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin.. The remaining colon measures 33 cm in length with a circumference of 7 cm at the distal resected margin.  The attached The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 3 cm in thickness. Attached unremarkable omental fat measures 18 x 6 x 1.3 cm.  The specimen is opened to reveal a mass lesion measuring 5.2 cm in length and 4.1 cm in width. Sectioning show that the tumor invades into the muscularis. The depth of invasion is 0.3 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached adipose tissue and are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.

Page Addendum Diagnosis. #1) SITE: LARGE BOWEL, RIGHT COLON  IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING FOR DNA MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS HAS BEEN PERFORMED. THE RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: MLH1: STAINING PRESENT IN TUMOR MSH2 : STAINING PRESENT IN TUMORS MSH6: STAINING PRESENTS IN TUMOR PMS2 : STAINING PRESENT IN TUMOR CONCLUSION: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING FOR THE TESTED DNA MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS IS RETAINED IN THE TUMOR. Some of the immunohistochemistry and Ish tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the department of pathology.. They have not been cleared or approved by the us food and drug. administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is. not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not. be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified. under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. ** End of Report *.
