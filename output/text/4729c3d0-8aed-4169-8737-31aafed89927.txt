SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Specimen entirely examined 4 Left vas deferens, resection:.  Benign fibromuscular and vascular tissue. 5. Left kidney, nephroureterectomy:. Histologic changes consistent with end-stage renal disease with diffuse glomerulosclerosis, extensive thyroidization and atrophy of tubules and interstitial chronic inflammation Vasculature with diffuse concentric myointimal hyperplasia Benign renal pelvic urothelial mucosa with proliferative changes 6. Portion of left adrenal gland, resection: Benign adrenal gland 7. Right kidney, nephroureterectomy: Histologic changes consistent with end-stage renal disease with diffuse glomerulosclerosis, extensive thyroidization and atrophy of tubules and interstitial chronic inflammation Vasculature with diffuse concentric myointimal hyperplasia Benign renal pelvic urothelial mucosa with proliferative changes I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT 1 HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Electronically Signed Out *** Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Right ureter" and consists of a segment of ureter measuring 1 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: FSC - frozen section control 2). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles".  It consists of a bladder with attached prostate and adnexa measuring 16.5 cm from superior to inferior, 10.5 cm laterally and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior.  The bladder measures 6.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm, the prostate measures 4.4 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm, the right seminal vesicle measures 3.4 x 2.0 x 0.9 cm, the right vas deferens measures 8.0 x 0.5 cm, the left seminal vesicle measures 3.2 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm and the left vas deferens measures 6.5 x 0.5 cm.. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is. shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal an ulcerated lesion measuring 3.2 x 2.2 cm grossly situated within the left lateral wall. The lesion measures 1.5 cm from the left orifice and 3.5 from the right. Both ureters are probe patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal underlying fibrotic papillary tissue extending to a depth of 1.3 cm grossly approaching into the perivesicular fat. The remaining bladder mucosa is inked tan. and otherwise grossly unremarkable.  Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are not grnssly identified. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal diffuse tan-yellow nodularity. The entire prostate is submitted. is submitted. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections:. UTHM - urethral margin RUM - right ureter margin. LUM - left ureter margin T - tumor Page 3 of 6

The entire specimen including all identifiable lymph nodes is submitted. Summary of sections: LN - lymph nodes ADD - remainder of the specimen 4) the specimen is received in formalin labeled" left vas deferens", and consists of a 6.5 cm in length, 0.5 cm diameter tubular soft tissue.  Representative sections are submitted.. Summary of sections: R - representative 5). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left kidney", and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels, and perinephric fat. The kidney weighs 76.5 g.  The kidney measures 10 x 4 x 3 cm. The attached ureter measures 23 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 0.2 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter are grossly unremarkable.  The adrenal gland is not identified. The kidney is bivalved to reveal focal hemorrhagic pelvic mucosa and  diffuse fatty infiltration in the renal parenchyma. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal thin cortex measuring 0.4 cm in thickness and pink brown parenchyma.  No lymph nodes identified in the perinephric fat. Representative sections are submitted for permanent sections.. Summary of sections: UVM -- ureteral and vessel margins. P -- Renal pelvis, representative sections K -- Representative sections 6) the specimen is received in formalin labeled" portion of left adrenal gland", and consists of golden yellow glandular soft tissue in  aggregate measuring 3 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. There is a moderate amount of the fat tissue attached to it. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: R - representative sections Page 4 of 6

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 7) The specimen is received fresh labeled "right kidney" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels, and perinephric fat weighing 550 g in total. The kidney weighs 71 g and measures 9 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm. The attached ureter measures 16 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 0.8 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identified. The kidney is bivalved to reveal tan-pink atrophic renal parenchyma with cortex measuring 0.6 cm in thickness.80% of the renal parenchyma is replaced by fat. The cortico-medullary junction is not well-defined. The calyces appear atrophic. No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric fat.  Representative sections are submitted for permanent sections.
