GROSS DESCRIPTION: Part 1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with patient' S name, initials xx, and "right glossectomy". The specimen consists of hemiglossectomy that measures 6.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 3.5 cm from

--- Page 2 ---
midline to lateral, and 3 cm from superior to inferior. There is an ulcerated lesion on the lateral side of the tongue with the ulceration measuring 3 x 1.5 cm. The inferior mucosal margin was taken for intraoperative. consultation. The specimen was inked and serially sectioned revealing a firm white tumor measuring 3.5 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm. The tumor comes to within 0.8 cm from the midline, 1.2 from the anterior tip mucosa, 2.3 from the posterior, 0.6 from the inferior mucosal margin, and 0.3 cm from the deep margin. The tumor focally abuts the deep edge (see part two which is additional tissue taken around this area). Gross photographs are taken. Representative. sections are submitted as follows: lAFs- frozen inferior mucosal margin resubmitted. 1B- anterior tip margin 1C- posterior shave margin. 1D- tumor and midline margin, perpendicular cut 1E-F- remainder of midline margin shave. 1G- Tumor and area where it abuts deep edge 1H- Tumor and deep margin. 1I-J- tumor INK CODE: Blue- anterior Green- posterior Black- medial Red- area banked Yellow- inferior mucosal edge. Orange- deep Time in formalin: 32 hours. Part 2 is received fresh labeled with patient' s name, initials xx, and. "right floor of mouth". The specimen consists of salivary gland and attached soft tissue that measure 3 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. The specimen was oriented by the. surgeon who communicated that this was deeper tissue taken from the area of concern in part 1. The deepest margin is inked orange according to the surgeon' s orientation. Two separate pieces of tan-brown soft tissue is also. present and measure 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm and 1 x 1 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted as follows: 2A-B- salivary gland with deepest margin inked 2C- separate fragments of soft tissue Time in formalin- 32 hours. Part 3 is received fixed labeled with patient's name, initials xx, and "level 1A". It consists of adipose tissue and associated lymph nodes with an overall measurement of 4.3 x 4 x 1.5 cm. Several lymph nodes are identified and. range in size from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm up to 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted in two cassettes labeled 3A and 3B.

Time in formalin- 1l hours. Part 4 is received fixed labeled with patients name, initials xx, and "right neck level 1B". It consists of adipose tissue, submandibular gland and. associated lymph nodes with an overall measurement of 5.7 x 4 x 2 cm. The submandibular gland measures 4.5 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm and is serially. sectioned to reveal a lobulated white parenchyma. Several lymph nodes are identified and range in size from 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm up to 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows: 4A- One lymph node bisected 4B- Lymph nodes 4C-D- representative sections of the submandibular gland. Time in formalin- 1l hours.. Part 5 is received fixed labeled with patient' s name, initials xx, and "right neck level 2, 3, 4, 5". The specimen consists of an unoriented radical neck dissection which measuresl3 x 8.5 x 3.5 cm, a separate piece of muscle which measures 4.5 x 3.8 x 2.0 cm and a separate piece of fibroadipose tissue which measures 4.5 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm. The radical neck dissection piece also contains a piece of muscle which measures 3.8 x 3.5 x 2.8 and a jugular vein (3.5 cm long and 0.7 cm in diameter). Between level 2 and 3 is a mass formed by two ill-defined nodules, one that is proximal (2.7x 2.2 x 1.7 cm) and another that is distal (2 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm). The proximal mass is adjacent to the jugular vein and the distal mass involves the muscle. The remaining fibroadipose tissue contains multiple lymph nodes (0.2 to 1.7 cm in maximal dimension). The piece of muscle that was separate grossly is not involved by tumor. Section Code: 5A- Level 2 lymph nodes 5B- Proximal mass 5C- Proximal mass and jugular vein 5D- Jugular vein proximal resection margin 5E- Jugular vein distal resection margin 5F-5G- Distal mass and muscle. 5H- Muscle proximal resection margin 5I- Muscle distal resection margin 5J-5K- Level 3 lymph nodes 5L-50- level 4and 5 lymph nodes (5L and 5M one lymph node in each, bisected) 5P- lymph nodes from separate fibroadipose tissue Time in formalin-ll hours. Part 6 is received fixed labeled with patient' s name, initials xx, and "left neck level 1B". It consists of adipose tissue, submandibular gland and

--- Page 4 ---
associated lymph nodes with an overall measurement of 5.5 x 4.5 x 2 cm.. The submandibular gland measures 5.0 x 4 x 3 cm and is serially sectioned. to reveal a lobulated white parenchyma. Two lymph nodes are identified and measure 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm and 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows: 6A- Lymph nodes 6B-c- representative sections of the submandibular gland. Time in formalin- 1l hours. Part 7 is received fixed labeled with patient' s name, initials xx, and "left neck level 2, 3, 4, stitch marks level 2". It consists of adipose tissue and associated lymph nodes with an overall measurement of 12.0 x 4.3 x 1.5. cm. Several lymph nodes are identified in level 2, 3, and 4 and range in size from 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm up to 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted as follows: 7A- One lymph node bisected, level 2 7B- level 2 lymph nodes 7C-D- level 3 lymph nodes 7E-G- level 4 lymph nodes Time in formalin- 1l hours.. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1AFS: INFERIOR MUCOSAL MARGIN, RIGHT TONGUE (frozen seCtion): A. SUFFICIENT FOR ANCILLARY STUDIES. B. BENIGN. C .
