PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS CANCER OF THE RIGHT BREAST AND AXILLARY NODES OPERATION PERFORMED DATE: 1es-0-3 DOCTOR(S) : PROCEDURE :  MASTECTOMY MODIFIED RADICAL carciiwmn, infltnnfrg 1obulw mmxeL wiH othu+ypw 85x4f3 TISSUE REMOVED. (SiqntRrm9) A. RIGHT BREAST B. RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS S1fxr Brst Nos c5s.9 GROSS DESCRIPTION 10/31 RECEIVED IN 2 PARTS. PART A RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT BREAST DOUBLE BLACK STITCH 12 O'CLOCK AT NIPPLE IS A 1,416 GRAM MASTECTOMY MEASURING 28.5 CM FROM MEDIAL TO LATERAL, 26.5 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, AND UP TO 6 CM FROM ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR.  A SUTURE DENOTES 12 O'CLOCK.  THE NIPPLE IS FLAT WITH THE SURROUNDING AREOLA MEASURING 6 CM IN DIAMETER. IN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT 6 CM FROM THE NIPPLE THERE IS A O.3 CM ULCERATION. 0.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. THIS IS 16 CM FROM THE NIPPLE.  THE SKIN ELLIPSE MEASURES 25.6 X 11.5 CM.. THERE IS A PALPABLE MASS AT 12 O'CLOCK. "MRM" IS WRITTEN ON THE SPECIMEN AT 12 O'CLOCK. THE ANTERIOR MARGIN IS MARKED BLUE AND THE DEEP IS MARKED BLACK. SECTIONING REVEALS THE MAJORITY OF THE BREAST TO CONSIST OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE WITH FINE FIBROUS BANDS. THERE ARE BROADER AREAS OF FIBROSIS IN THE MORE CENTRAL ASPECT OF THE SPECIMEN. IN THE 12-1 O'CLOCK AREA THERE IS A FIRM GRAY-TAN MASS WHICH IS GREATER THAN 1 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN MEASURING 5.8 CM FRCM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, 2.5 CM FROM ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR, AND 4 CM FRCM MEDIAL TO LATERAL.  CENTRALLY THERE IS AN IRREGULAR AREA OF RED-BROWN DISCOLORATION. THIS IS ALSO GREATER THAN 1 CM FROM THE OVERLYING SKIN. A COIL CLIP IS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE LESION.  SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS:  A1--NIPPLE, A2--SKIN ULCERATIONS AND 12 O'CLOCK SKIN MARGIN, A3--DEEP MARGIN TO CENTRAL LESION, A4~-ANTERIOR MARGIN TO CENTRAL LESION, A5 THROUGH A7--A SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR CROSS SECTION THROUGH THE LESION AT LEVEL OF CLIP, A8--THE MOST MEDIAL ASPECT OF LESION, A9--MOST LATERAL ASPECT OF LESION, A1O AND

PART B RECEIVED LABELED AXILLARY CONTENTS ARE 4 FRAGMENTS OF YELLOW-PINK FATTY TISSUE TOGETHER MEASURING 1O X 7.S X 1.5 CM. THE SPECIMEN IS THEN EXAMINED FOR LYMPH NODES. ALONG ONE EDGE OF THIS SPECIMEN THERE ARE STRANDS OF RED MUSCLE FIBERS. EXAMINATION REVEALS 8 NODAL STRUCTURES. THESE ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS. FOUR (4) OF THESE MEASURE LESS THAN O.5 CM AND ARE SUBMITTED AS BI.  ONE OF THE LARGER NODES IS GROSSLY POSITIVE, ONE-HALF IS SUBMITTED IN B2, THE MIRROR IMAGE AS P11 PER THE CLINICAL BREAST CARE PROJECT RESEARCH PROTOCOL. THE REMAINING 3 LARGE NODES ARE EACH SUBMITTED BISECTED AND SEPARATELY LABELED B3 THROUGH B5. B6 IS REPRESENTATIVE MUSCLE.  A BIOPSY CLIP IS NOT GROSSLY IDENTIFIED. COMMENT : THIS CASE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH CAP/ASCO GUIDELINES OF 6-48 HOURS FORMALIN FIXATION TIME.

A REPRESENTATIVE SECTION OF SKELETAL MUSCLE IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.  BIOPSY CHANGES ARE NOT IDENTIFIED GROSSLY OR MICROSCOPICALLY IN THE NODAL DISSECTION.S ADDENDUM Addendum #l Entered: THE LATERAL UPPER OUTER QUADRANT IS RE-EXAMINED AND A WING CLIP IS IDENTIFIED IN AN AREA OF FATTY TISSUE, WITH THE TISSUE ANTERIOR HAVING A YELLOW-WHITE INDURATION CONSISTENT WITH A PREVIOUS BIOPSY AREA. THE AREA OF THE CLIP PROPER IS SUBMITTED IN A17 AND 18.  THE TISSUE ANTERIOR TO THIS AREA IS SUBMITTED IN A19 AND 20.  LATERAL TO THIS, THERE IS A GROSSLY POSITIVE NODAL STRUCTURE O.6 CM IN DIAMETER.
