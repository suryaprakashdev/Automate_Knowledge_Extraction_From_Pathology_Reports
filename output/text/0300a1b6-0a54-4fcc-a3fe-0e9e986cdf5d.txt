Surgical Pathology Histopathological Examination Pre-Op Diagnosis : Right Renal Mass On Native Kidney.Right Hydronephrosis Of Transplanted Kidney Order Physician. Specimens : Kidney, Right. Frozen Diagnosis. Report : GROSS EXAMINATION: The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with the name of the patient and labeled as kidney, right. The specimen consists of a kidney and attached perinephric fat. The kidney measures 6 x 3.8 x 2.2 cm and weighs 47 g. The ureter and vascular margins of resection are submitted in block 1. The renal sinus/hilar margin is submitted in block 2. Sectioning shows an oval tan mass in the mid lateral aspect which measures 3.1 cm in greatest dimension. The mass. bulges against the capsule but is not grossly adherent to the capsule. A section of capsule overlying the mass is submitted in block 3. The mass does not grossly involve the. renal sinus. Sections of the mass are submitted in blocks 4-7. The pelves and calyces are not grossly dilated. The cortex averages 0.l cm. A random section of kidney is submitted in block 8. Sectioning through the attached fat shows no lymph nodes or adrenal tissue. This case was reviewed with DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Kidney, right, nephrectomy:  Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type I, Fuhrman grade 2, 3.1 cm, confined to kidney with negative margins (see cancer case summary checklist below). KIDnEy: Nephrectomy, Partial or Radical (Version 3.l.0.0) PROcEuRE: Radical nephrectomy SPECIMEN LATERALITY: Right THIS CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED DOCUMENT/INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAW.

TUMOR SITE: Middle TUMOR SIZE: Greatest dimension: 3.1 cm TUMOR FOCALITY: Unifocal MACROSCOPIC EXTENT OF TUMOR: TumOr limited to kidney HIsToLogic TypE: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type I SARCOMATOID FEATURES: Not identified HISTOLOGIC GRADE (FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE): Grade 2: NuClei slightly irregular, approximately 15 microns, nucleoli evident. MICROSCOPIC TUMOR EXTENSION: Tumor limited to kidney. MARGINS:  Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified. PATHOLOGIC STAGING (pTNM): Primary Tumor (pT): pTla: Tumor 4 cm or less in greatest dimension, limited to kidney. Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pNx: Cannot be assessed, no nodes submitted or found. Distant Metastasis (pM): Not applicable. PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN NONNEOPLASTIC KIDNEY:  End stage renal renal disease with numerous sclerotic glomeruli,. thyroidization of tubules, fibrosis, and chronic inflammation.. COMMENT: This case was delayed to perform a panel of immunostains which shows the tumor cells to be positive for ck7, EMA, pankeratin, vimentin, CDl0, Rcc, pAx8, and P504S. They are negative for wTl. Positive and negative controls stained appropriately. Based on the histologic appearance and immunoprofile, this neoplasm is best interpreted as papillary renal cell carcinoma, type I. A fragment of tumor is associated with the edge of the soft tissue on the section of the ureteral and vascular margins. Multiple step sections are examined. Based on the very peripheral location of the tumor with no macroscopic evidence of involvement of the medulla or renal sinus, this tumor focus is best interpreted as a knife carry-over or a floater.
