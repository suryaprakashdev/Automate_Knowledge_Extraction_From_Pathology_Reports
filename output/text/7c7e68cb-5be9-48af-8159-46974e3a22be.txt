Note: The tumor is predominantly papillary in architecture with cells that mainly have an abundant cytoplasm that ranges from completely eosinophilic to clear. Although, the morphologic features in general are in favor of papillary renal cell carcinoma type I, the cytological features of "clear cells" are concerning for clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, racemase, carbonic. anhydrase and vimentin and are negative for TFE3 and SDHB. Controls stained. appropriately. The immunohistochemical profile and morphologic features are consistent with the diagnosis of renal papillary carcinoma type I. Dr.  has reviewed the case and concurs with the diagnosis. Gross Description: Received are two formalin filled containers, each labeled with the patient's name Part A Specimen components and dimensions: The specimen is the product of a left nephrectomy, having aggregate dimensions of 15 x 11 x 10 cm and consists of a kidney having dimensions of 10 x 7 x 5 cm, ureter with length of 5 cm. Adrenal gland is not present. Size, appearance, and location of tumor: 5 x 3 x 2 cm located in the mid/superior pole, well encapsulated, inside the capsule the tumor is a friable tissue, yellow tan- to grey tan in color. It is contained within the kidney parenchyma boundaries. Renal capsule/renal sinus: The renal capsule strips with ease. Renal vein: The renal vein is free of tumor. Lymph nodes (size, number, & location): Perihilar fibrofatty tissue weighs 100 grams, it was placed in a fat clearing agent for 30 minutes. Serial sectioning and palpation does not reveal any obvious lymph nodes. Portions of fibrous fatty tissue with probable lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes A13-14 for microscopic analysis. Other findings: Multiple cortical cysts that measure from 0.5 cm up to 2 cm in greatest dimension. Blocks submitted: A1 ureter and vascular margins; A2-4 tumor to renal capsule; A5-6 tumor to renal sinus fat; A7 tumor to collecting system; A8 tumor; A9-12 representative sections of the cysts; A13-14  Perihilar fibrofatty tissue with possible whole lymph nodes Part B is additionally labeled "periaortic lymph nodes" and consists of multiple portions of fibrofatty tissue that measure in aggregate 3 x 3 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals four possible lymph nodes that range from 0.5 cm up to 2 cm in greatest dimension.

Blocks submitted: B1-2 multiple whole lymph nodes; B3 one lymph node bisected; B4  one lymph node bisected;  one lymph node bisected. Microscopic Description: The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination findings. END OF REPORT Surgica! Pathology Report Taken DOB: Gender: F lw 12///13
