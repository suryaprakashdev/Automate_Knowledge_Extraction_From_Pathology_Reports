EXCISION RIGHT BREAST: Single Stitch-Anterior/Double Stitch-Lateral/Triple Stitch-Superior Received fresh is a 59g oriented tan pink WLE breast specimen, 7.0cm from superior to inferior, 6.0cm from anterior to posterior and 5.5cm from medial to lateral. The specimen is inked as follows: Red-. Superior, Orange-Inferior, Biue-Anterior, Black-Posterior, Green-Medial, Yellow-Lateral. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 7 slices; slice 1 being most lateral, slice 7 being most medial.

TSS ID SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 PR: Positive Allred Score: 6 = Proportion Score 3 + Intensity Score 3 COMMENT:  The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8.. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by  following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. interpretation of the ER/rk irnmunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL Intensity: 2+ % Tumor Staining: 20% Fish Ordered: Yes , on Date METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit  using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides.  providea oy tne manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in- house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force.

TSS ID ' by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17 signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block usedD9 Source of case: RPCI formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No:NA Tissue fixation breast Results interpreted: yes Tissue source HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.05 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration:  manual count Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free and overall survival in stage ll, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No treatment decision for stage li, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test FDA APPROVED REAGENT  PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of patients fnr whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the , , Institute under the direction of. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
