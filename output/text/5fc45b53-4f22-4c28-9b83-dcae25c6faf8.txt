Signature (Case signed Case clinical Information BILATERAL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA Gross Description Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "right kidney and proximal ureter" is a previously inked and bivalved 400 gram Total nephrectomy specimen with attached perinephric fat. Ovetall dimensions of the specimen are 18 x 10 x 7 cm. The kidney proper measures 9 x 4 x 5 cm. The vessels at the hilum are identified. The ureter is identified and measures 2. cm in length. Grossly, no lymph nodes are identified at the hilum. On the bivalved kidney, the cut surface is remarkable for an engapsulated, circumscribed, tan/yellow mass measuring Prepared for

The mass grossly appears to be pushing the capsule  Adjacent to the mass is a 2.5 cm cystic structure that is lined with a tan, glistening and grossly unremarkable tissue with no excrescences. The mass measures to the Up junction of the specimen 3.8 cm. The remainder of the cut surface reveals several|additional cortical cystic structures ranging in size from 0.$ cm down to 0.2 cm. Further sectioning the kidney, on the opposite pole of the mass the cut surface reveals a smooth 0.5 cm nodule measuring to the capsule and fatty tissue 0.8 cm. The remainder of the cut surface is grossly unremarkable. No adrenal |gland was identified in the specimen. Representative sections  are submitted as follows: Al=right ureter resection margin; A2=remainder of vessels at hilum; A3-A7-entire mass demonstrating mass to capsule and fat; A8, A9=representative sections of cystic structure adjacent to mass previously described; Al0=representative section of additional smaller nodule;  All=representative section of additional smaller. cortical cyst; A12-representative section of up junction tissue, A13= ureter.
