Surgical Pathology - Working Draft Clinical History The patient is a year-old woman with breast cancer. A. tracking sheet accompanies the specimen and indicates a high family risk for cancer and preoperative diagnosis of known left breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant. No specimen radiograph is requested. Multifocality is suspected on the left side. Special stains for ER, PR, and HER2/neu are requested as a repeat. The diagram indicates that the known tumor is in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast, and a suspicious area is present in the upper inner quadrant at approximately the 11 o'clock position above the nipple. Recent MRI indicates the presence of a known 2-cm tumor with clip present in the lateral breast of the left breast in addition to an adjacent 5-mm lesion that is immediately posteromedial to the primary lesion. A 5-mm suspicious area is also identified in the slightly upper inner quadrant.. Gross Description The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. Parts A through D and F are received fresh, and Part E is received in formalin.. Part A is additionally labeled "right breast nodule." It consists of a single unoriented, irregular piece of soft, pink tissue, measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis as FS1, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette A1.. Part B is additionally labeled "sentinel lymph node left axilla, count - 180o, frozen section.* It consists of a single irregular piece of soft, yellow-pink, fatty tissue, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis as FS2, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette B1. Part C is additionally labeled "right breast." It consists of a mastectomy specimen, oriented with a short suture considered superior and long suture considered lateral; oriented as such, the specimen measures 3.2 cm from anterior to posterior, 14.7 cm from medial to lateral, and 13.7 cm from superior to inferior. The mastectomy specimen weighs 212.5 gm. The specimen includes an area of skin, measuring 14.5 x 6.7 cm, with nipple, measuring 1.7 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm, and areola. measuring 3 x 3.8 cm. The specimen has been previously inked and serially sectioned by the serial slices. Inking follows standard inking, with posterior black, anterior superior blue, and anterior inferior green. The accompanying research paperwork indicates that a fragment of tissue has been taken for tissue banking. Cut sections reveal that the breast is composed almost entirely of homogeneous, firm, white, fibrous tissue that abuts the deep margin. Thin layers of adipose tissue are present in the anterior surface as well as the medial aspect of the specimen. No grossly evident lesions are identified. The nipple and skin similarly appear unremarkable. Slice 1 is considered medial, and slice 10 is considered lateral. The nipple, thereby, is in slice 5. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. Cassettes C1-C2: Nipple, entirely submitted. Cassette C3: Upper outer quadrant from slice 8. Cassette C4: Upper outer quadrant from slice 7.. Cassette C5: Lower outer quadrant from slice 8. Cassette C6: Lower outer quadrant from slice 7. Cassette C7: Upper inner quadrant from slice 4.. Cassette C8: Upper inner quadrant from slice 3. Cassette C9: Lower inner quadrant from slice 3.. Cassette C10: Lower inner quadrant from slice 2 and section of skin from slice 4.. Part D is additionally labeled "left breast," with further specification in the requisition form indicating that a green stitch - questionable secondary cancer, correlate with MRI, and black short - superior, long - lateral. A firm, pale-tan, circumscribed lesion, measuring 1.6 x 1.2 x 1.4 cm, is present at the 3 o'clock position, 3 cm from the nipple; this contains a surgical clip. The lesion is 0.1 cm from the deep margin, 0.9 cm from the skin, 2.2 cm from anterior superior, 1.9 cm from anterior inferior, 3.5 cm from the lateral margin, and <10 cm from the medial margin. Immediately inferior and medial to main lesion, a 0.4-cm area contains multiple punctate, firm, yellow spots. This lesion is 0.5 cm from the large lesion and is 0.5 from the deep margin. The remainder of the specimen is composed mostly of firm, fibrous tissue, showing multiple. small cystic areas, with a maximum diameter of O.4 cm, throughout. The area adjacent to the green suture on slice 6 similarly consists of dense, fibrous tissue, and no definitive lesions are identified in this area. The skin, nipple, and areola appear unremarkable.

Surgical Pathology  Working Draft Accompanying paperwork from the ' : ndicates that a portion of the. specimen has been taken for tissue banking. The specimen contains a short stitch and long black stitch, taken to be superior and lateral, respectively, and has been previously inked and sectioned by the research technician into ten slices, from medial to lateral. Inking is as per standard, with posterior in black, anterior superior in blue, and anterior inferior in green. The blue ink appears faint. The most-medial slice is taken as slice 1 and the most-lateral slice as slice 10. The specimen, thereby, measures 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 15.6 cm from medial to lateral, and 16.6 cm from superior to inferior and weighs 192.5 gm. A skin ellipse is present, measuring 6.6 x 13.1 cm, with the long axis in the mediolateral extent. The areola measures 3.4 x 3 cm, and the nipple measures 1.8 x 1.6 x 1.6 cm. The nipple lies in slices 5 and 6. The green nylon suture is in the posterior aspect of slice 6 at the 12 o'clock. position, 3.5 cm superior to the nipple. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette D1: 1.6-cm lateral lesion in relation to deep margin from slice 8. Cassette D2: Punctate, yellow lesion from slice 8. Cassette D3: Nearest anterior-superior margin in slice 8. Cassette D4: Nearest anterior-inferior margin from slice 8. Cassette D5: Additional 1.6-cm lesion in relation to skin.
