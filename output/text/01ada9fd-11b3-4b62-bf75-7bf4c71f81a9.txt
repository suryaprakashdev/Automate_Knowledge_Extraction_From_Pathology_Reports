No lymph nodes identified. IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL).AND THAT IHAVE REVIEWEDANDAPPROVEDTHISREPORT. Special Studies: Result SpecialStain Comment RECUT RECUT RECUT Gross Description: 1).The specimen is received in fresh state for intraoperative consultation, labeled as"right kidney,ureter, and bladder cuffand it consists of a total nephrectomy specimen weighing in total 502 g.The specimen surface is inked.No adrenal gland is identified. Kidney measures 11x 6.0 x 3.9 cm,and the segment of ureter measures 19 cm in length and 0.8 cm in circumference.The distal end of the ureter may actually represent "bladder cuff.Sectioning reveals a well-circumscribed brown soft cortical mass measuring 3.2 x 3.2 x2.9 cm in the lower medial aspect of the specimen.The majority of the tumor is in close contact with sinus fat, but frank invasion is grossly not identified. Grossly evident venous invasion is not seen. Perirenal fat is uninvolved. Background renal parenchyma shows mildly thinned cortex (0.7 cm) with sharp cortical medullary junction. Pelvic mucosa and ureteral mucosa appears grossly unremarkable.No possible lymph nodes are identified in the perirenal fat.The specimen is photographed. TPS is taken.

Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: U--undesignated 3).The specimen is received in formalin,labeled as paracaval lymph nodes",and it consists of multiple possible lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0 cm.Entire lymph nodes are submitted.

The specimen is received in formalin, labeled as "right common iliac lymph nodes",and it consists of a single possible lymph node measuring 0.6 cm.Entire lymph node is submitted Summary of sections LN-- lymph node Akihiko Yoshida,M.D. 5).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled as precaval and inter-aortocaval lymph node",and it consists of multiple possible lymph nodes measuring up to 3.5 cm.The largest lymph node is trisected. Entire lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: TLN--trisected lymph node LN--lymph nodes Akihiko Yoshida,M.D 6).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled as "suprahilar nodes and right adrenal gland",and it consists of an adrenal gland and surrounding adipose tissue.Adrenal gland measures 7.0 x 3.5 x 1.6 cm and weighs 10.5 g after the removal of fat. Section reveals grossly unremarkable adrenal tissue. Surrounding adipose tissue does not contain grossly evident lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted.
