Sex:F Source of Specimen(s): 1:Para caval Lymph Node 2:Right Kidney, resection 3:Para caval Lymph Node 4:Peri renal fat Gross Description: Received in four parts. Source of tissue:1.Labeled#1,paracaval lymph node (VERIFIED). Intraoperative Consultation:NO TUMOR SEEN PER Gross Description: Reccived fresh for frozen section diagnosis labeled paracaval lymph nodeis a 1.8 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm brownish-tan firm rounded lymph node.Submitted entirely for frozen section as1FSA. ****************************** Source of tissue:2.Labeled#2"right kidncy Gross Description:Received fresh labeled " right kidney"is a 273 gram/13 x 7 x 5 cm kidney partially covered by retractcd perinephric fat.Upon sectioning, obliterating approximately two-thirds of the kidney by volume located within the mid/inferior pole is a 8.5 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm hemorrhagic golden orangish-tan partially necrotic, encapsulated rounded tumor mass.Along the outer surface vantage point this mass appears very unevenly lobulated, and some points appcar to extend through the capsule to the inked outer surfacc. Also,this impinging mass significant reduces the volume of the pelvocaliceal collecting system, and the remaining viewable pclvic mucosa appears pale-tan and glistening.The outer superior pole kidney surface is lobulated, and this somewhat normal appearing renal parcnchyma has somewhat demarcated corticomcdullary borders with a cortex thickness of 0.9 cm. Upon opening, the 13.5 x 0.5 cm uninvolved uretcr has an unremarkable mucosal surface, and a very short vein segment is probed closely along, but uninvolved by a tumor edge. Within the hilar fat are three pale grayish white hard rounded mctastatic appcaring lymph nodes ranging in size 0.4-0.9 cm, and within the superior pole fat is a 0.9 cm hemorrhagic firmness for probable lymph node,and no obvious adrenal gland.

Gross Description:Received fresh labeled" paracaval lymph node" is an 8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm portion of soft lobulated fat containing four potential lymph nodes ranging in sizc 0.2-1.9 cm.The largest lymph node is color-coded by the application of black ink prior to sectioning. Entirely submitted in 3A. *********************************************************** Source of tissue:4.Labcled #4,"fat around kidney" Gross Description:Received fresh labeled" fat around kidncyis a 6.5 x 5.5 x 0.4 cm portion of partially hemorrhagic soft lobulated fat.Upon palpation, the 0.3 x 0.2 cm firm focus is designated by the application of black ink.Otherwise, there are no other obvious findings.Representative sections1 k******* Final Diagnosis: 1.Paracaval lymph node, excision -No tumor seen in one lymph node, (0/1). 2.Right kidney,nephrectomy: -Papillary renal ccll carcinoma type 2, 8.5 cminvolving renal sinus and perinephric fat. -Surgical resection margins are free of carcinoma -Metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma involving four of five hilar. lymph nodes,4/5. -Extracapsular cxtension is identificd 3.Paracaval lymph nodes,excision: -No tumor seen in eight lymph nodes,0/8) 4.Fat around kidney,excision: -Benign adipose tissue. pTNM:T3 N2 Mx
