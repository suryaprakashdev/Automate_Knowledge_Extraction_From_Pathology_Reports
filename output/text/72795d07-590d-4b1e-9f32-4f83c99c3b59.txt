Within the lower pole there is an 8.0 x 7.2 x 7.0 cm tan/yellow/red firm, well circumscribed, variegated mass. The mass bulges the capsule, but does not grossly appear to invade through it. The majority of the mass is solid (90%) with the remaining 10% being cystic. The cysts are filled with dark brown liquid. There are no white myxoid areas grossly noted. The mass does not invade into the sinus fat or involve the pelvis. The remainder of the kidney parenchyma is red/brown with a distinct corticomedullary junction. The renal vein artery and ureter are all patent. The adrenal gland is not grossly identified.. Block summary: Al - ureter, vein and artery margins, en face A2-A3 - mass with respect to capsule.
