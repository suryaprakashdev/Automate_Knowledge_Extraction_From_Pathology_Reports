Labeled #1, "sentinel node right axilla'" Touch Preparation/Frozen Section Evaluation: TOUCH PREP NO TUMOR SEEN, FROZEN SECTION NO TUMOR SEEN PER Gross Description: Received fresh for touch preparation/frozen section evaluation labeled "sentinel node right axilla" are two tan focally blue dye stained firm 1ymph nodes, 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. They are sectioned, touch preparations are made and frozen sections are performed on each lymph node. The frozen section residues are submitted in two blocks. The remaining lymph node tissue is entirely submitted in four blocks.. Designation of Sections: 1FSA- frozen section lymph node A, 1FSB- frozen section lymph node B, 1A-1B- 1TPA, 1C-1D- 1TPB Summary of Sections: multiple. Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "right breast lumpectomy" Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "right breast lumpectomy" is a 9.0 x 7.5 x 4.5 cm yellow-tan fragment of breast tissue. It is covered in part by a 5.0 x 2.5 cm light-tan skin ellipse. There is a short stitch denoting the superior margin and a long stitch denoting the lateral margin. The margins are inked in black, the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal predominantly yellow-tan adipose tissue. There is an ill-defined, 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm firm mass having tan gritty cut surfaces with infiltrating borders. This grossly appears to jw 3|as|i>

come closest to the inked anterior, posterior and medial margins. Representative sections are submitted in ten blocks. Designation of Sections: 2A- superior, 2B- inferior, 2C-2D- medial, 2E- lateral, 2F-2H- anterior, 2I-2J- posterior Summary of Sections: multiple. ******************** Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, "final posterior margin (pectoral margin)" Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "final posterior margin (pectoral margin)" is a 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm red-purple fragment of soft tissue and muscle. There is a stitch present marking the final margin and this area is inked in black. The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted in one block Designation of Sections: Block 3 Summary of Sections: undesignated-multiple. Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled #4, "final anterior and medial margin" Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "final anterior and medial margin" is a 6.0 x 0.6 cm tan elliptical fragment of skin excised to a depth of 0.4 cm. The margins are inked in black, it is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in two blocks. Designation of Sections: 4A-4B Summary of Sections: multiple Final Diagnosis: 1. Right axilla, sentinel lymph nodes, excision: - Two lymph nodes with no tumor seen (0/2), see note. Note: Immunohistochemical stains for Cytokeratin will be reported as an addendum. 2. Right breast, lumpectomy:- Invasive lobular carcinoma, grade II with. microscopic focus of pleomorphic changes (3.0 cm); lymphovascular invasion is not seen. - Invasive carcinoma extends to the inked and cauterized lateral and inked anterior breast parenchymal margin; approximately 2.0 mm from the inked. posterior margin. - Focal atypical ductal hyperplasia approximately 1.0 mm from inked. superior margin. 3. Final posterior margin:. - Fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle, no tumor seen.

Pathology Fellow: Pathologist(s): Electronically Signed By Pathologist Procedures/Addenda Addendum Date Ordered: Status: Date Complete: By: Date Reported: Addendum Diagnosis Immunohistochemistry stains for the sentinel lymph nodes (specimen #1) do not reveal metastatic carcinoma, comfirming the histologic diagnosis. These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the immunohistochemistry laboratory at the These tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food. and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or. approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes.. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This. laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1998 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical. testing.
