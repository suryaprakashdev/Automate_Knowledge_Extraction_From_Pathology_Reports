TISSUE DESCRIPTION: l A2 B1 Cl D1 E1 E2 Fl F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 tallbladder (8.0 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm), peritoneal biopsies (No.l, 3 mm; No.2, 3 mm), peri choledochal lymph node (2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm), and right adrenal gland (5.82 grams, 6 x 3.7 x 1.5 cm), right lobe liver (2,680 grams, 27.5 x 19.5 x 12.5 cm), and cystic duct lyuph node (0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm). DIAGHOSIS: Liver, right lobe, hepatectomy: Grade 3 (of 4) hepatocellular carcinoma, usual type, forming a dominant 16 x 15 x 13 cm mass with innumerable satellite nodules ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 6 cm. The tumor is located in the right lobe. The hepatic capsule is involved, but adjacent organs spared. The surgical margins are involved grossly. Extratunoral vascular invasion is identified, involving portal veins microscopically. The tumor is partially encapsulated, infiltration of parenchyma being of infiltrating type. A single separately submitted periportal lymph node is negative for tumor. Information regardiny the uninvolved hepatic parenchyma will be reported in an addendum. Adrenal gland, right, excision: Metastatic grade 2 (of 4) hepatocellular carcinoma forming multiple (2) separate masses (l.4 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm and 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm). Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis. Negative for tumor. Peritoneal, No.l and No.2, biopsies: Negative for tumor. Lymph nodes, cystic duct and pericholedochal, excision: A single ystic duct lymph node and a single pericholedochal lymph node are negative for tumor. ADDENDUM: The non-neoplastic liver is non-cirrhotic and shows changes that are likely related to adjacent mass effect. No ground-glass hepatocytes are seen.

DIAGNOSIS: Liver, right lobe, hepatectomy: Grade 3 (of 4) hepatocellular carcinone, usual type, forming a dominant 16 x 15 x 13 cm mass with innumerable satellite nodules ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 6 cm. The tumor is located in the right lobe. The hepatic capsule is involved, but adjacent organs spared. The surgical margins are involved grossly. Extratumorel vasculer invasion is identified, involving portal veins microscopically. The tumor is pertially encapsuleted, infiltration of parenchyma being of infiltrating type. A single separately submitted periportal lymph node is negative for tumor. Information regarding the uninvolved hepatic perenchyma will be reported in an addendum. Adrenal gland, right, excision: Metastetic grade 2 (of 4). hepatocellular carcinone forming multiple (2) separete masses (l.4 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm and 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm). Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Chronic cholecystitis with. cholesterolosis. Negative for tumor. Peritoneal, No.l and No.2, biopsies: Negative for tumor..  Lymph nodes, cystic duct and pericholedochal, excision: A single negative for tumor.. ADDEHDUM: The non-neoplastic liver is non-cirrhotic and shows changes that are. likely related to adjacent mess effect.  No ground-glass hepatocytes are seen.
