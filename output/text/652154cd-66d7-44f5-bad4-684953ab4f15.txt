UUID:E49FAC55-434A-429B-8E61-C5E0FBD7C15C W ai3 TCGA-GM-A5PX-01A-PR Redacted 92 DIAGNOSIS (A) LEFT BREAST, SKIN-SPARING TOTAL MASTECTOMY: TWO FOCI OF INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, NOTTINGHAM HISTOLOGIC GRADE 1 (WELL- DIFFERENTIATED). (SEE COMMENT 1) AT 6 O'CLOCK INVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES 1.5 X 0.4 CM IN CONTIGUOUS SECTIONS/SLICES. INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS PRESENT O.6 CM FROM CLOSEST INFERIOR MARGIN. FOCAL DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), LOW GRADE, SOLID PATTERN. AT 2 O'CLOCK INVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES 3.5 X 3.0 CM IN CONTIGUOUS SECTIONS/SLICES. MARGINS ARE WIDELY FREE, PRESENT AT LEAST 1.0 CM FROM CLOSEST SUPERIOR MARGIN. FOCAL DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), LOW GRADE, SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM PATTERNS. Associated fibroadenoma. Atypical lobular hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia. Secretory changes. OBuiastNo S 85&0 056.9 Reactive changes consistent with previous biopsy site. S:t. Dense fibrosis consistent with capsule.. 9o 81sl13 Microcalcifications present in association with invasive and in situ carcinoma, and with benign breast tissue. Nipple and skin, no tumor present. Skeletal muscle, no tumor present.. Intact breast implant, gross examination only.. (B) LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: MICROMETASTASIS PRESENT IN ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE. (SEE COMMENT 2) TUMOR CELLS ARE HIGHLIGHTED BY CYTOKERATIN IMMUNOSTAIN AND ARE PRESENT WITHIN AN AREA MEASURING 0.75 X 0.1 MM IN LARGEST SINGLE SLIDE DIMENSION (C) LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY:  SINGLE CYTOKERATIN POSITIVE ISOLATED TUMOR CELL PRESENT IN ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE, MEASURES 0.01 MM IN GREATEST SINGLE SLIDE DIMENSION. (SEE COMMENT 3) (D) LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: Fibroadipose tissue, no lymphoid tissue identified. Immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin is negative. COMMENT 1) Immunohistochemical stains for biologic markers are pending. 2) In specimen B, the frozen sections are reviewed but the tumor cells are not evident. In H&E stained permanent sections, the. Iargest group of tumor cells can be identified but the tumor cells are bland and well differentiated. The tumor cells are best seen on immunostained slides and are present in four areas in the lymph node sections. The majority of the tumor cells are clustered within a 0.75 x 0.1 mm area. In addition, isolated tumor cells, singly or in pair, are present in three other regions of the lymph node sections. 3) In specimen C, tumor cells are not evident in the frozen and permanent H&E sections. GROSSDESCRIPTION (A) LEFT BREAST, SHORT SUPERIOR, LONG LATERAL - A 16.0 x 15.0 x 7.0 cm skin sparing total mastectomy specimen that is oriented by the surgeon with a short stitch designating superior and a long stitch designating lateral. The specimen is partly surfaced by a 4.5 x 3.5 cm ovoid portion of pale tan wrinkled skin. Located on the surface of the skin is an everted nipple surrounded by a rim of areola that measure 1.2 and 3.5 cm in diameter, respectively. The specimen is serially sectioned from. medial to lateral into eleven slices. The nipple is located in slice #5. In slices #2 through #10 there is a 12.0 x 12.0 x 2.7 cm breast. implant and cavity lined by a pink-white smooth, glistening, fibrous capsular tissue. The specimen contains an intact brand breast implant filled with a translucent viscous material. Identifying information is as follows: The breast implant measures 12.0 x 12.0 x 2.7 cm and is for gross only. Radiographs are taken of the specimen and display at the 6 o'clock position, within slices #5 and #6, a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm firm, gray-white mass that grossly comes to within 0.6 cm from the anterior inferior margin, 3.5 cm from the deep margin, 3.5 cm from the nipple and abuts the implant capsule. There is a metal biopsy clip located in this mass in slice #5. At the 2 o'clock position, in slices #8 through #10, there is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.3 cm firm gray-white mass that grossly comes to within 3.0 cm from the deep margin, 1.0 cm from the anterior superior margin, 2.5 cm from the anterior inferior margin, and abuts the implant capsule. There is a metal biopsy clip located in slice #9 in this mass..

Negative cases. are defined as those with no staining (Score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (Score 1+). Equivocal or indeterminate cases are  those with strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells, or complete membrane staining that is either non-uniform or weak in intensity, but with obvious. circumferential distribution in at least 10% of tumor cells (Score +2) Reference Wolff AC, Hammond EH, Swartz JN et al.
