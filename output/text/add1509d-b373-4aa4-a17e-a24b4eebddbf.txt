Frozen Section Diagnosis FSA1 AND TOUCH IMPRINT: CORE BIOPSY OF RIGHT KIDNEY: Positive for carcinoma. Comment: This frozen section diagnosis/result was communicated to and acknowledged by Dr. M.D., nave performed the intraoperative consultation (s) and issued the above. diagnosis. Gross Description A. The specimen is received fresh in 2 containers. Specimen A is labeled, *core biopsy, right kidney". The specimen consists of 3 core biopsy fragments of pink-tan tissue which are ranging from. 1.5 to 2.5 cm in length. Touch and print of the specimen is prepared for cytological evaluation. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section as FSA1.. B. Specimen B is labeled, *right nephrectomy". The specimen consists of a partial nephrectomy which measures 4.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm, weight 26g. The renal capsule is tan-red, brown, focally hemorrhagic, smooth and glistening. Prior to sectioning, the specimen is inked as follows: Parenchymal resection margin: Black. Capsular surface.d Blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an irregular to roughly ovoid, ill detined, rubbery intraparenchymal tumor which measures 3 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The tumor bulges capsule and partially involves central area of the parenchymal resection margin. Cut surface of the tumor is tan-gray to pink, focaly hemorrhagic, without evidence of necrosis. Aiso received in the same container,

completion nephrectomy specimen including a kidney (10.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm, weight 116 g) which is surrounded by perinephric adipose tissue ranging from 1 to 2.5 cm in thickness. There is a 3 cm length of ureter attached to the kidney, which is grossly unremarkable. There is a partial nephrectomy site on the lateral aspect of the kidney measuring 4 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. Prior to sectioning, the specimen is inked as follows:. Perinephric adipose resection margin:. Orange. Renal capsule surrounding partial nephrectomy site: Black. Deep aspect of the partial nephrectomy site:. Black. The deep aspect of the partial nephrectomy site extends to the renal pelvis, partially involving it. The urothelium of the renal pelvis adjacent to the nephrectomy site is focally hemorrhagic. No residual tumor is grossly identified within the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis adjacent to the partial nephrectomy site. The remaining renal parenchyma and urothelium of the caliceal system, renal pelvis, and a portion of the ureter are grossly unremarkable. The renal artery, renal vein and their branches are grossly unremarkable and do not appear to be involved by the tumor. No lymph nodes are grossly identified within the hilar adipose tissue. No adrenal gland is found within the perinephric adipose tissue. Representative sections of the specimen were submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in 23 cassettes, as follows: B1: Resection margin of the ureter. tangential section B2: Resection margins of the renal artery and vein, tangential sections. 83 and B4 Perinephric adipose tissue resection margin closest to the tumor, perpendicular cross sections. B5-B12:Representative sections of the tumor,bulging capsule, and involving the deep aspect of nephrectomy specimen. B13-818: Deep aspect of the partial nephrectomy site adjacent to the tumor with a portion of renal pelvis. B19-822 Additional sections of the deep aspect of partial nephrectomy site. 823 Grossly unremarkable renal parenchyma.. DISQUALIFIED
