Tumor: Normal: Addendum Discussion: Sections demonstrate gray and white matter with a moderately hypercellular, infiltrative, moderately atypical fibrillary astrocytes. Neither tumor necrosis nor microvascular. proliferation are seen.. Numerous MIB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen. In the most. proliferative areas, a labeling index of 13.8% is calculated, consistent with a highly. proliferative high grade glial neoplasm . Addendum Diagnosis: Left Temporal and Periventricular tumor Anaplastic Astrocytoma (Grade III)  MIB-1 Labeling Index= 13.8% Microscopic Description: Permanent sections of the frozen section specimens demonstrate a moderately hypercellular, diffusely infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm. The tumor cells demonstrate. moderate to focally marked atypia. A few mitotiz figures are seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.
