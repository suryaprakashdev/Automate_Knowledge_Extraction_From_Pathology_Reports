Surgery Date TCGA-CJ-4905 DIAGNOSIS (A) RIGht KiDNEY: RENAL CELL CARCINOmA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 2. (SEE COMMENT) TumoR measures 3.8 Cm In mAxImum DImensiOn. Vascular, ureteral and soft tissue margins of resection free of tumor. Adrenal gland, no tumor present. COMMENT Histologic sections show tumor focally pushing into but not directly invading the renal sinus adipose tissue. In a few areas, only a thin rim of fibrous tissue separates tumor and sinus adipose tissue. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT KIDNEY - A specimen of right kidney (14.0 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm) with surrounding adipose tissue, overall 20.0 x 12.0 x 5.0 cm. Palpation reveals a firm nodular region in the lower pole. The specimen is opened along the ureter and bivalved to reveal a 3.8 x 3.5 x. 3.0 cm tumor that abuts the renal sinus and extends to within 5 mm from the surface of Gerota's fascia. The tumor is confined within the kidney and appears to be generally well circumscribed. The cut surface of this tumor is variegated, bright-yellow, cystic, with dark-  brown hemorrhagic areas. A portion of unremarkable adrenal gland measuring approximately 2 cm x 2 cm x 0.5 cm is also identified at the superior pole of the adipose tissue. The 10 cm segment of ureter is up to 0.5 cm in diameter, and is unremarkable. INK COdE: Black - surface of Gerota's fascia overlying tumor. SECTION CODE: A1, vascular and ureter margins; A2, adrenal gland; A3-A9, tumor adjacent to renal sinus; A10-A13, adjacent tumor with renal parenchyma; A14, tumor closest to inked surface; A15, normal renal parenchyma. Representative tumor and normal kidney are submitted to tumor bank. CLINICAL HISTORY SNOMED CODES T-71000, M-83123
