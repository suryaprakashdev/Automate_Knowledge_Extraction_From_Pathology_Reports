There are two grossly identified tumor masses, microscopically show invasive ductal carcinoma. The submitted tissue between these two masses. shows microscopic foci of invasive tumor as well as DCis. The largest confluent invasive tumor measures 3.3-cm. Breast biomarkers were ordered on the right breast tumor and addendum report to follow. These markers were reported on the needle biopsy of the left breast ().

TSS: : The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cellis staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2.. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by Following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimens Involved SpecimenS: E: RIGHT BREAST & AXILLARY CONTENTS Specimen:  Surgical Excision Block Number: E6 Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL Intensity: 2+ % Tumor Staining: 20% Fish Ordered: Yes , on Date METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.  Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved HercepTest (TM) test kit ! 'sing rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in- house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.. Additional presumptive lymph nodes from part E (right mastectomy) were submitted in 15 blocks, from E31 to E45. Three additional lymph nodes are identified, negative for metastasis (0/3).. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FisH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome  17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the 3y Dr. majority of tumors cells displayed extensive polysomy 17. with 4 to 8 chromosome 17 signals and 4 to 8 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block usedE6 Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No:NA Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 0.95 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic

Method of ratio enumeration: manual count Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free and overall survival in stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.. No treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test FDA APPROVED REAGENT  PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of patients for whom Hercentin theraov is being considered. These tests were performed in the under the direction of Dr.. The resuits of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
