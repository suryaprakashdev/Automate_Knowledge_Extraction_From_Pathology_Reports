Physician: Account #: Patient Address: Billing Type: Additional Copy to: Ref Source is & History: With right renal mass and caval thrombus. Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Right kidney, renal vein thrombus, vena caval thrombus; radical nephrectomy 2 SP: Portion ol right gonadal vein; biopsy. 3: SP: Para caval and pre caval lynph nodes; excision.  4: $P: Right renal lymph nodes; excision. DIAGNOSIS: 1. SP: Right kidnoy, renal vein thrombus, vona caval thrombus; radical nephrectomy: Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma - Unclassified type with high nuclear grade; see note. Tumor Size: Greatesl diameter is 12.2 cm. Local Invasion (for renal cortical types). Involves renal sinus fat Involves ronal hllar fat Renal Vein Invasion: Identified Tumor is also seen in muscular veins in the region of the renal sinus/hilum Surgical Margins. Tumor present al renal vein margin.  Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Unremarkable Adrenal Gland: Not identified Lymph Nodes. Not identified Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma:. pT3b Tumor grossly extends into the renal vein(s) or vena cava below the diaphragm Noto: The tumor displays predominant papillary and focally solid archilecture and is composed of cells with abundant eosinophilic cyloplasm and high nuclear grade, Immunohistochemical stains are strongly positive for racemase and CD10 (the lalter in a luminal" paltorn), show patchy positivity for CA-IX, and are negativo for CK7, 34BE12, TFE-3, TFE-B and CEA. The combination Page 1 of 4

 of these findings raises a differential diagn! cell carcinoma and a tumor ol distal nephron origin. This case has been reviewed wit? which concurs with the diagnosis.. 2. SP: Portion of right gonadal vein; biopsy: Benign segment of vascylar tissue. 3. SP: Para caval and pre caval lymph nodes; oxcision: Lymph Nodes: Not involved Number of nodes examined:11. SP: Right renal lymph nodes; excision: 1.ymph Nodes: A ganglioneurona (1. icn) and adjacent benign adrenal tissue are seen: no tymph nodes identified Somo of the immunohistochemistry and ISh tesls were developed and their performance charactoristics were detorminod by the Department o!

CD10 RACEMASE CK7 CEA P 348E12 IMM RECUT NEG CONI IGH Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh labeled "right kidney, renal vein thrombus, vena caval thrombus" and consists ol a xidney willh. allached ureter, renal vossels and perinephric fat weighing 526 g in total. The kidney measures 12.2 x 8.6 x 6.8 cm. The attached.  ureter measures 4.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The atlached renal vein measures 6.6 cm in length and 1.8 cm in  diameler, and is completely filled with tan, friable feshy lumor mass. The ureter margin is grossly unremarkable. The kidney is.  inked black and bivalved to reveal a 12.2 x 9.2 x 7.4 cm irregular lobulaled, friable tan tumor mass, comptelely replacing upper pole.  and mid kidney. The tumor grossly invades into the renal sinus and renal vein. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-modul nclion. The cortex measures 0.6 cm. The specinen is photographed. Representative soctions are submitted for Id for permanont seclions. Summary of sections:.  RAM - renal artery margin. RVM -- ronal vein margin. UM -- ureteral margin Page 2 of 4
