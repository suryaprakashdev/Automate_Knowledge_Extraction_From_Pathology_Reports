(See Comment) (B) SENTINEL LyMPH NODE #2, LEFT AXiLLA, BIOPSY: One lymph node, free of tumor. (See Comment). (C) LEFT BREAST, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY: INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA OF BREAST, MODIFIED BLACK'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (POORLY DIFFERENTIATED). INVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES 1.2 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. Lymphatic/vascular invasion is not identified. INTRADUCTAL CARCINOMA (DCIS), MODIFIED BLACK'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (POORLY DIFFERENTIATED), COMPRISING SOLID TYPE, WITH NECROSIS, COMPRISING <5% OF THE TUMOR AREA. INVASIVE CARCINOMA EXTENDS TO WITHIN 5.O MM OF THE NEAREST DEEP MARGIN All margins are free of tumor. (D) LEFT BREAST, SECOND DEEP MARGiN, EXCISION: Skeletal muscle, no tumor present.. (E) LEFT BREAST, SECOND MEDIAL MARGIN, EXCISION: UUID: 8CF4E53E-924F-40C6-8748-BC8A1F705662 No tumor present. TCGA-GM-A2DL-01A-PR (F) LEFT BREAST, SECOND SUPERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION: Redacted No tumor present. (G) LEFT BREAST, SECOND INFERIOR MARGIN: No tumor present. Entire report and diagnosis completed by v OMMENT Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratins have been requested on tissue sections from both sentinel lymph nodes. Those results will be reported as an addendum. Molecular pathologic assays have been requested on tissue sections from block C1 of the primary tumor. Those results will be reported as an addendum. The invasive carcinoma measures 1.2 cm in greatest  microscopic diameter (slide C1) and focally invades pectoralis muscle, extending to within 5.0 mm of the deep margin (slide C2). GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT AXILLA, SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY #1, IN VIVO 216, EX VIVO 4 - A 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm lymph node. The specimen is transected and two touch imprints were performed. The remnant of the tissue is submitted in toto in A. *TP/DX: NO CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED. (B) LEFT AXILLA SENTINEL BIOPSY #2, IN VIVO 416, EX VlVO 887 - A 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm lymph node with surrounding fat tissue. Specimen is bisected and two touch imprints are performed. A remnant of the lymph node is submitted in B1-B2. *TP/DX: NO CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED. (C) LEFT NEEDLE LOCALIZATiON, SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY - A segmental mastectomy specimen (7.0 x 7.0 x 4.0 cm) with a skin ellipse (2.8 x 1.2 cm). The specimen has two clips indicating anterior aspect and one clip indicating the middle aspect. e specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral. The cut surface shows an ill-detined, white-tirm lesion measuring O.8 x 6 x 0.6 cm that is 0.7 cm trom the deep margin. The remnant of the breast tissue is predominantly composed ot fatty tissue. INK CODE: Green - inferior; blue - superior; black - deep; yellow - superficial; red - lateral; orange - medial. SECTiON CODE: C1-C2, tumor in relation to the deep margin; C3, extra section from the tumor; C4-C5, random section from the breast including the skin. ) SECOND DEEP MARGIN, CLIP ON TRUE MARGIN - An oriented irregular fragment of skeletal muscle measuring 3.0 x 1.5 x 5 cm. The specimen is oriented as clip on true margin. The true margin is inked in black. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in D1-D2 (E) SECOND MEDIAL MARGIN, CLIP ON TRUE MARGIN - An oriented irregular fragment of adipose tissue measuring 4.O x 2.0 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is oriented as clip on true margin. The true margin is inked in black. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in E1-E4.
