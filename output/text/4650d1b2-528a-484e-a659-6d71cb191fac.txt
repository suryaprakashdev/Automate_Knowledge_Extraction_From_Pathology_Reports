SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Perivesical Lymph Nodes:. Not identified The Pathologic Stage is (AJCC 2002):  pT3 (Invasion of perivesicle soft tissue) PR2 (Periprostatic or periseminal vesicle soft tissue invasion). 2.  Right distal pelvic lymph nodes, resection: Lymph Node Dissection: Metastatic urothelial carcinoma Number of lymph nodes examined: 2 Number of lymph nodes with metastatic disease: 1 Size of the largest lymph node involved by tumor: 1.8cm.. Size of the largest metastatic focus : 0.9 cm. Ettranddal extension is identified Left di$tal pelvic lymph nodes, resection: Lymph Node Dissection:  Benign fibroadipose tissue. Right distal ureter: - Urothelial carcinoma in situ - Resection margin involved by carcinoma in situ. 5. Left distal ureter: - Urothelial carcinoma in situ - Resection margin involved by carcinoma in situ. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, peri-vesicle lymph node". It consists of a bladder with attached prostate and adnexa measuring 19.0 cm from superior to inferior, 11.0 cm laterally and 5.0 cm from anterior to. posterior. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal hemorrhagic, ulcerated, indurated, necrotic tumor measuring 5.0 x 4.8 x 1.8 cm which is grossly situated within the ieft and right posterior walls. The tumor grossly invoives both the left and. right ureteral orifices.  Both ureters are probed patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to. reveal white-pink cut surface with invades the underlying fat. Possible extension to the inked fat is grossly identified. The remaining bladder mucosa is pink-tan with the normal folds. Two ovoid lesions measuring 0.6 x 0.4 cm are identified at the dome and right posterior wall. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identified.  The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal white-tan. prostatic parenchyma with multiple yellow foci and white fluid filled cysts identified. A gold thread-like material is identified within the prostate.  Representative sections are submitted sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted, gross photograph taken. Summary of sections: UTHM - urethral margin RUM - right ureter margin LUM - left ureter margin Page 2 of 5

The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right distal pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of three pink tan firm , fatty lymph  nodes ranging from 1.5 to 3.2 cm in greatest dimension.  All identified lymph nodes are submitted.. Summary of sections: LN - lymph node BL1 - bisected lymph node #1 BL2 -- bisected lymph node #2. 3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left distal pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of a portion of yellow tan adipose tissue measuring 4 x 1 x 1 cm. No palpable lymph node is identified. Entirely submitted.. Summary of sections: U - undesignated 4) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "right distal ureter- unclipped end is margin" and consists of a gray-tan segment of ureter measuring 0.7 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter.  A clip is present at one end which is inked black. The opposite end, identified as the margin, is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned and totally submitted..
