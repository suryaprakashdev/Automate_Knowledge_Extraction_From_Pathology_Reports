I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es). ADDENDUM 1: Tissue was sent to the for assay of the estrogen and progesterone receptors. The estrogen receptor activity was judged to be positive with an estimated FMoL value of 30. The progesterone receptor activity was judged as positive with an estimated FmoL of value of 101. Please refer to. for a complete report.
