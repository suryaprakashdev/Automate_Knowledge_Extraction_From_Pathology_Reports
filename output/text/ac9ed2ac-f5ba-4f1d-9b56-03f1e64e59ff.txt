The skin with. the vermillion component has dimensions of 9.5 x 6 cm and the vermillion component has dimensions of 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The buccal mucosa is remarkable for a large centrally ulcerated mass which is 6.8 x 5 cm ulcerated to a depth of up to 2.3 cm. The skin bearing component is essentially unremarkable with the exception of a suggestion of submucosal tumor extension to the proximal pole of the vermillion border (see gross photo). The entire circumferential aspect of the specimen is surfaced by tissues which are uninvolved by this tumor. The superior aspect of the specimen is inked ir yellow, inferior aspect is inked green, the superficial aspect not surfaced by skin is inked blue. The proximal aspect is inked red. The distal aspect is inked red on black and the deep aspect is inked black. Those portions of the specimen surfaced by mucosa and/or skin remain un-inked. Please note, these inked regions do not represent true margins (see frozen sections). There is no bony component identified with this specimen..

No sections are submitted on these gross only tissues. This portion of the case has been reviewed by staff pathologist. Microscopic Description: The histologic evaluation of the specimen demonstrates a poorly differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma that arises from the buccal mucosa. The tumor is composed of malignant pleomorphic cells arranged in sheets and nest with squamous pearls of keratin in the more well-differentiated areas. The tumor infiltrates through the muscles of the buccal mucosa into the soft tissue of the skin and abuts the mucosa at the vermilion boarder of the lip. The tumor does not extend to the surface of the skin. The tumor involves nerves with areas of angiolymphatic invasion. The surgical resection margins are negative.
