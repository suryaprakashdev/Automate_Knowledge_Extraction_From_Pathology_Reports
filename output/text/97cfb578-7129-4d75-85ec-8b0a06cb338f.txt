PATIENT HISTORY: Colon mass. prE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Colon mass. Post-OP Diagnosis: Same. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic colectomy attempted, open right colectomy done. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Segment of terminal Ileum and Right hemicolectomy -- A. INVASIVE WELL-DIFFERENTIATED COLON ADENOCARCINOMA a. 0.9 Cm InVAsive tumOr IntO SUb-mucOSA b.  INVASIVE CARCINOMA ARISING IN A 2.5 CM GREATEST DIMENSION TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMAS With serrated features. B. ADDITIONAL NON-INVASIVE ADENOMAS: 2 TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMAS (2.9 CM AND 1.5 CM) AND 1 TUbular ADenoma (1.0 Cm).  RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA AND ADENOMA. D.  NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS SEEN. E.  Sixteen benign Lymph nodes (0/16). F. PaTHOLOgIc STage; T1 nO mX. G. TErmINal ILeUm WIth nO SigNIFiCant PAThOLOgIC CHanGE. H. APPENDIX WITH TUBULAR CARCINOID TUMOR. a. TuBUlAr CArcInoiD ArI$es in The AppenDIx TIp. b. TUBULAR CARCINOID MEASURES 3MM. C. (see comment). COmmENT: Immunohistochemical stains were performed on the appendix (slide C). Appendix tumor cells are weakly positive for. glucagon and positive for CDX2, mCEA, pancytokeratin, and synaptophysin. It is negative for estrogen receptor, prcgesterone receptor, chromogranin , and p53. These findings are compatible with a tubular carcinoid. CASE SyNOPSIS: Synoptic data - primary colon, rectal, Appendix tumors SPECIMEN TYPE: Right hemicolectomy Specimen Length: 22.5 cm Tumor site: Cecum TumOR CONFIgURATION: Arising in a polyp TUMOR SIZE: Greatest dimension: 0.9 cm INTACTNESS OF MESORECTUM: Not applicable HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Adenocarcinoma HISTOLOGIC GRADE:S Low-grade (well to rmoderately differentiated) PATHOLOgIC STAGING (pTNm): pT1 pNO Number of nodes examined: 16 Number of nodes involved: 0 pMX MARGINS:  Proximal margin uninvolved by invasive carcinoma  Distal margin uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Circumferential (radial) margin - Not applicable ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION: Absent PERINEURAL INVASION: Absent Tumor boRDer conFiguratIOn: Pushing TUMORAL LyMpHOCYTIC RESPONSE: None ADOITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Adenoma(s) Other polyps (type[s]):2 tubulovillous adenomas, 1 tubular adenoma. SpECIAL PROCEDUReS: Microdissection Genotyping Interpretation Molecular Anatomic Pathology testing for Microsatellite Instability: A. No microsatellite instability detected (Microsatellite stable) B. Immunohistochemistry for the hMLH1, hMSH2 and hMSH6 showed preserved gene expression. Note: The specimen was analyzed by PCR for microsatellite instability because the patient met one or more of the recently recommended criteria for testing (1). The five recommended dinucleotide and mononucleotide polymorphisms were utilized to assess for microsatellite instability (MSl). zERO of five markers showed evidence of microsatellite instability.. Additionally, the immunohistochemistry for hMLH1, hMSH2 and hMSh6 demonstrated preserved nuclear staining in the neoplastic.
