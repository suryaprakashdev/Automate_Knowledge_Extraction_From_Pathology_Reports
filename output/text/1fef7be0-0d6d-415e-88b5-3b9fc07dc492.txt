FOR OFFICIAL USR ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "LEFT BREAST, LONG LATERAL, SHORT SUPERIOR" is a left mastectomy specimen. The specimen consists of a 921 gram left mastectomy specimen received fresh and oriented with a short suture superior and long stitch lateral. The specimen measures 23.0 cm from superior to inferior, 21.0 cm from medial to lateral, and 4.0 cm anterior to posterior. The 9.0 x 5.0 cm superficial skin ellipse is essentially located, 0.8 cm near the nipple free of discharge. No scars are noted. 'The superficial surface is. partially inked blue, the deep margin is inked black. ' Serial sections reveal a 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm firm, pink-tan, fairly well circumscribed mass in the mid outer breast. The mass is located 3.5 cm from the deep margin, and 0.8 cm from the superficial inked surface. Located 2.0 cm medial to this mass (also at the mid outer breast) is a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm irregular nodularity, which, upon resection, appears to consist of a cystic fibrous. tissue. The cystic tissue is located 2.0 cm from the deep margin. The remainder of the specimen is composed of lobulated adipose tissue admixed with 50% focally cystic fibrous tissue, with this area located in the lower quadrant. No additional lesions are identified. No lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette Key:. Al: Skin. A2: Mass. A3: Mass with superficial margin.. A4: Mid outer cystic tissue.. A5: Upper outer quadrant.. A6: Upper inner quadrant. A7: Lower inner quadrant with margin 1.5 cm away.. A8: Lower outer quadrant. Matched sections of A1, A2, A4-A8 are submitted in ocr for cbcp protocol. Additional sections are submitted as follows: A9: Nipple. A10-Ali: Additional sections of mass.. A12-A13: Sections of the possible smaller mass and outer quadrant. 13cfss. B. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NoDE #1" is a firm, tan fragment of soft tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is bisected, and submitted entirely. Cut section reveals a variegated, tan, soft tissue. C. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 AND #3" are two intact pink-tan lymph Page 2 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
