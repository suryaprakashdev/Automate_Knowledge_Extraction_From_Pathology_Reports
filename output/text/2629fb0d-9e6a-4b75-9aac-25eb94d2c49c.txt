DIAGNOSIS (A) LEFT MENTAL NERVE: Segment of nerve, no tumor present. (B) PARTIAL MANDIBULECTOMY, RESECTION: DEEPLY INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED (3.5 CM) WITH PLEURAL INVASION. PERINEURAL INVASION SEEN. (C) RIGHT VENTRAL TONGUE MARGIN: Squamous mucosa, no tumor present. (D) LEFT VENTRAL TONGUE MARGIN: Squamous mucosa, no tumor present. (E) RIGHT ALVEOLAR RIDGE MARGIN: Squamous mucosa, no tumor present. (F) LEFT ALVEOLAR RIDGE MARGIN: SQUAMOUS MUCOSA WITH INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA. (G) LEFT NEW ALVEOLAR RIDGE MARGIN: Squamous mucosa with focal dysplasia, no tumor present. (H) NEW RIGHT ALVEOLAR RIDGE MARGIN: Squamous mucosa, no tumor present. Entire report and diagnosis completed b GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT MENTAL NERVE, CHECK PERINEURAL INVASlON - A tan-white nerve (0,9 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm) that is unremarkable. No orientation information is given. Submitted entirely for frozen sectig *FS/DX: SEGMENT OF NERVE, NO TUMOR PRESENT. (B) PARTIAL MANDIBULECTOMY - A portion of mandibulectomy and attached white-tan skin with overall measurements of 9.0 x 4.5 x 5.0 cm. The skin is light tan, intact and hairbearing (5.5 cm in width and 9.5 cm length). The upper mucosal aspect of the specimen has an ulcerated deeply invasive lesion measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x approximately 3.5 cm. The tumor is light tan, firm and involves the cortical bone and extends to the soft tissue mass that infiltrates the skin. The bony margin appears unremarkable and the soft tissue margin grossly unremarkable. The specimen is submitted from anterior to posterior under B1-B11 and B12, B13, skin and tumor; B14, representative section of tumor; B15, another representative section of skin and tumor.. (C) RIGHT VENTRAL TONGUE MARGIN-A piece of mucosa measuring2.6 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. Blue ink is present designating the true margin. The mucosa is tan and glistening with no lesion. The specimen is submitted entirely en face for frozen section examination. Page 1 of 3 Surgical Pathology Report File under: Pathology

*FS/DX: SQUAMOUS MUCOSA, NO TUMOR PRESENT. (D) LEFT VENTRAL TONGUE MARGIN - A strip of mucosa measuring 2.2 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Blue ink is identified designating the true margin. The specimen is entirely submitted en face in cassette D for frozen section examination.. *FS/DX: SQUAMOUS MUCOSA, NO TUMOR PRESENT. (E) RIGHT ALVEOLAR RlDGE-A rim of mucosa measuring 2.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm.Blue ink is identified designating the true margin. The specimen is entirely submitted with the margin en face in cassette E for frozen examination. *FS/DX:SQUAMOUS MUCOSA, NO TUMOR PRESENT. (F) LEFT ALVEOLARRIDGE MARGIN-A piece of mucosa measuring 2.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The mucosa is unremarkable. Edge of blue ink is identified desianating the true margin.The specimen is submitted entirely with the margins en face in cassette F for frozen examination. *FS/DX: INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (G) LEFT NEW ALVEOLAR RIDGE MARGIN -A piece of mucosa measuring2.2 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm which has unremarkable mucosa.An edge with blue ink is present designating the r ew true margin. The mucosal margin is trimmed out and put entirely with ink en face in cassette G for frozen examination. *FS/DX: FOCAL DYSPLASIA. NO INVASIVE CARCINOMA H NEW RIGHT ALVEOLAR RIDGE-A tan-pink soft tissue fragment 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm). The cut surface is unremarkable INKCODE: Blue = new resection margin. SECTION CODE: H, perpendicular sections of the entire specimen. CLINICAL HISTORY None given. Released by: Page2of3 Surgical Pathology Report File under: Pathology
