RIGHT LUNG, DIAPHRAGM AND PERICARDIUM, EXTRAPLEURAL PNEUMONECTOMYS (INCLUDING FSA) : DIFFUSE MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, EPITHELIOID TYPE, SOLID ANDS TUBULOPAPILLARY PATTERNS. Tumor involves: chest wall parietal pleura, maximal thickness of 0.8 cm,.  mediastinal pleura, and diaphragmatic pleura. Tumor involves visceral pleura.. Visceral pleural involvement by tumor is confluent and includes an interlobar fissure. Tumor invades lung parenchyma in two foci. Tumor invades pericardium but does not extend to the inner surface of. the pericardium. Diaphragmatic, pleural and bronchial resection margins are free of. tumor. Tumor is <0.l cm from apical, lateral, medial, anterior, posterior parietal pleural resection margins. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified. Hyaline pleural plaque is not identified. Mild pulmonary emphysema is present.. "HILAR" LyMPH noDEs: Four (4) lymph nodes with no tumor present.. AJcc classification (7th edition): pT3 N2 (see below, part I).. I. Level 8 node #2. METASTATIC MEsOTHELIOMA, present as a microscopic focus within the subcapsular space of one (1) of three (3) lymph nodes. Page: 1 of 4

Right lung, diaphragm and pericardium (Fs). 1/9. Level 8 node #2.. O.R. CONSULTATION: SPECIMEN LABELED "#8 RIGHT LUNG DIAPHRAGM & PERICARDIUM" (FSA): Bronchial resection margin, negative for tumor.. The senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a gross and/or microscopic examination of the described specimen(s)~and rendered or confirmed the rapid diagnos(es) related thereto. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in eight parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. Part A, "#1. Port site #1", consists of a tan/yellow soft tissue fragment (3.9 x 3.9 x 1.4 cm) with attached skin ellipse (2.6 x 0.5 cm). The specimen consists of yellow lobulated adipose tissue with a central area of fibrosis. extending from the skin ellipse to the deepest aspect. There are no masses or. lesions identified. Representative sections are submitted for histologic. examination. Micro Al-A2: Soft tissue with skin ellipse in Al, 1 frag each, Rss.. Part B, "#2. Rib", consists of a portion of rib (15.2 x 2.1 cm) with attached red/brown fragments of skeletal muscle. There are no masses or lesions identified. A rib bone marrow squeeze is submitted for histologic examination. Micro Bl: Rib bone marrow squeeze, multi frags, Rss. Part C, "#2. Level 2R node", consists of a tan/pink lymph node (1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic examination.. Micro Cl: Lymph node, 1 frag, Ess. Part D, "#4. svc node", consists of a tan/brown/yellow lymph node (1.8 x 0.7 x. 0.4 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic examination.. Micro Dl: Lymph node, 1 frag, Ess. Part E, "#5. Level 8 node", consists of a tan/brown anthracotic lymph node (1.0. x 0.9 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic. examination. Micro El: Lymph node, 1 frag, Ess. Part F, "#6. Level 4R node", consists of a tan/yellow soft tissue fragment (0.6 Page: 2 of 4

Pathology Report x 0.4 x 0.2 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic examination. Micro Fl: Soft tissue fragment, 1 frag, Ess. Part G, "#7. Level 7 node", consists of a tan/brown focally anthracotic lymph node (0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic examination. Micro gl: Lymph node, 1 frag, Ess.. Part H, "#8. Right lung, diaphragm and pericardium (Fs)", consists of a 1518 gram moderately disrupted extrapleural pneumonectomy specimen (31 x 23 x 7.4 cm) including lung (21 x 14 x 5 cm), parietal pleura, pericardium (7 x 6 cm) and hemidiaphragm (18 x 11 x 1.2 cm). There is a bronchial resection margin (3.3 cm in length x 2.2 cm in diameter) that is submitted en face for frozen section analysis as FsA..  The parietal pleura is gray/white/brown, moderately. disrupted, and covered with multiple (greater than hundred) partially confluent Tumor is present close to all pleural resection margins. The visceral pleura contains multiple (greater than fifty) tan/white partially confluent nodules (up to 1 cm).  Tumor bulges (1.7 cm) into lung parenchyma of  all lobes and thickened up to (1.2 cm) the entire distance of all intralobar septae. The diaphragmatic parietal pleura is fused (lo0%) and thickened (l.4 cm) by nodular tumor. The diaphragmatic margins are grossly free of tumor with the closest approach to tumor being 0.5 cm from the anterior margin. The tumor invades to a depth of. 0.2 cm into the muscle of diaphragm, but the inferior surface is free of tumor. There are mild emphysematous changes in the peripheral lung parenchyma. There are three firm anthracotic hilar lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. Micro Hl: Bronchial resection margin, en face, FsA remnant, 1 frag, Ess. Micro H2: Apical parietal pleural margin, 1 frag, Rss. Micro H3: Medial parietal pleural margin, 1 frag, Rss. Micro H4: Lateral parietal pleural margin, 1 frag, Rss. Micro H5: Anterior parietal pleural margin, Micro H6: Posterior parietal pleural margin, 1 frag, Rss. Micro H7: Medial diaphragm margin, 1 frag, Rss.. Micro H8: Lateral diaphragm margin, 1 frag, RSS. Micro H9: Anterior diaphragm margin, 1 frag, Rss.. Micro H10: Posterior diaphragm margin, 1 frag, Rss.. Micro Hll: Diaphragm, I frag, Rss. Micro H12: Tumor and intralobar septae, 1 frag, Rss. Micro H13-hi4: Tumor extension into lung parenchyma, 1 frag each, Rss. Micro H15: Uninvolved upper lobe, 1 1 frag, Rss. Micro H16: Uninvolved lower lobe, 1 frag, Rss. Micro H17: Pericardium with closest extension of tumor to pericardial surface, 1 frag, RSS. Micro Hl8: Hilar lymph nodes, 3 frags, Ess. Part I, "#9. Level 8 node #2", consists of tan/brown/yellow soft tissue fragment (3.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for. histologic examination. Micro Il: Soft tissue fragment, 1 frag, Ess. By his/her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a microscopic examination ("gross only" exam if so stated) of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es) related thereto.
