GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Right breast":  Received fresh is a 25 x 17 x 3.5 cm right breast and axillary tail. Attached to the breast is an 18 x 9 cm ellipse of skin containing the nipple. In the inner upper and inner lower quadrant there is a 6 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm biopsy cavity. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is firm to hard breast tissue.  This tissue extends from the biopsy cavity from 1.0 x. 2.5 cm in all directions. Tissue from this main tumor mass was submitted for estrogen receptors labeled as "a". Approximately 5 cm lateral to the biopsy. cavity there is another nodule within the breast that measures approximately 3 cm in diameter. Tissue from this smaller mass was submitted for estrogen receptors labeled as "b". Small amounts of firm breast tissue are palpated between the main tumor mass in this second 3 cm tumor mass. It is difficult. to determine whether this second tumor mass is an isolated lesion or an extension of the main tumor mass.. Block Summary: Al: Section adjacent to biopsy cavity containing a deep margin which has been. inked blue. A2: Section adjacent to biopsy site containing deep margin. A3: Random section of tumor adjacent to biopsy site.. A4: Section of firm area between the biopsy cavity and the smaller mass lateral to it. A5: Section of the 3 cm in diameter mass lateral to the biopsy cavity. A6: Upper outer quadrant. A7: Lower inner quadrant. A8: Skin beneath the biopsy cavity. A9: Nipple. A10: Lymph nodes from the proximal 1/3 of the axillary tail. All: Lymph nodes from the mid 1/3 of the axillary tail.. Al2: Lymph nodes from the distal 1/3 of the axillary tail. DIAGNOSIS: A. "RIGHT BREAST": RIGHT BREAST STATUS POST BIOPSY FOR INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA WITH EXTENSIVE RESIDUAL INVASIVE CARCINOMA EXTENDING INTO THE DEEP DERMIS (BLOCK A8). HISTOLOGIC GRADE: III. NUCLEAR GRADE: III. B. "LYMPH NODES": LEVEL-I, NEGATIVE FOR CANCER, ONE EXAMINED. LEVEL-II, LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR CANCER, SIX OF NINE EXAMINED. LEVEL-III LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR CANCER, TWO OF FIVE EXAMINED. ALL FINAL SURGICAL MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR CANCER.S Verified by: (Eiectronic Signature; Date Sign eBrowser Resulf 1 of 1
