Ailreuo) Ghrid ,cortex C74  SPECIMEN TYPE: Adrenal A JtO 1/s0/13 T CLINICAL NOTES: L) adrenal tumour ?ACC. Cushing's syndrome.. h 0 MACROSCOPIC: 'Left adrenal tumour'. The specimen consists of an adrenal gland 57 x 40 x. L 63mm, with associated fat 100 x 40 x 12mm. The tumour has been bisected prior 0 to receipt. The total weight of the specimen including the periadrenal tat is 110g. The fat weighs approximately 30g and theretore the estimated weight of G the adrenal tumour is 80g.. Y The cut surface ot the adrenal tumour is tan and lobulated with two foci of cystic and haemorrnagic degeneration, 12mm in maximum dimension. The capsule appears otherwise intact. A wedge of tumour, 17 x 12 x 14mm has been removed prior to receipt. At the edge of the lesion there is a weil-circumscribed area that is distinct from the lesion, 22 x 17 x 12mm. The cut surface of the tumour is inked green and the capsular surface and fat inked black. On sectioning, there is an area of haemorrnage/necrosis, 17 x 13 x 12mm in maximum dimension. Normal appearing adrenal gland is seen within the fat, and focally the tumour is seen to arise from the normal adrenal. Adjacent to the larger area of haemorrhage, is a well-circumscribed zone with a haemorrhagic centre, 12mm in maximum dimension. Macroscopically the lesion appears well-circumscribed. A Representative sections in 15 blocks. Green ink covers the area where tumour N was removed prior to receipt and does not indicate a true margin.. Blocks 1, 3&4: include normal adrenal gland. A Blocks 2,3: paired T Blocks 5,6: haemorrhagic/necrotic area. Block 7: additional possible area of haemorrhage. 0 Block 8-15: additlonal sections of adrenal lesion M 1 MICROSCOPIC: The 80g adrenal tumour is an ADRENAL CORTICAL CARCINOMA. The tumour is c composed of variably pleomorphic cells. Most tumour cells have prominent A nucleoli and some multi-nucleate tumour giant cells are present. Many of the cells have voluminous eosinophilic (oncocytic cytoplasm). Using the scoring L system proposed by Weiss et al, the tumour would have a Weiss score of 4 due to high nuclear grade, atypical mitoses, predominantly eosinophilic cell type and capsular invasion. Tiny foci of necrosis are present but there is insuificient P coagulative necrosis to warrant a point under the Weiss system. No sinusoidal or venous invasion is present. The mitotic rate is 4 mitoses per 50 hpt. A Much of the tumour is confined to the adrenal, however there are unequivocal T H 0 L A

G The adrenal away from the carcinoma is normal. Y Immunohistochemistry ot the adrenal tumour is as follows:. IGF2: Negative.
