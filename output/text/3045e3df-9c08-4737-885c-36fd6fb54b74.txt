C 7i.d IDH1: Negative MIB-1 LI: 13.3% O'Brai, , tinyoras Sshe C71.z Qw 9/a7ll 3 Discussion: The neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 with a minority expressing p53. MIB-1 reactivity areas are seen within the tumor but in the most proliferative areas a labeling index of 13.3% is calculated, consistent with a high grade astrocytoma. Microscopic Description: Sections demonstrate a diffusely infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm. Atypia ranges from mild to moderate. There is mild to moderate hypercellularity. The tumor cells resemble fibrillary astrocytes. Some areas are suggestive, but not definitive, for perinuclear halos.. A careful examination only reveals a rare mitotic figure. There is no microvascular. proliferation or necrosis. UUID:436222D6-7870-4C4A-8F3A-50562E9AB8A3 TCGA-HT-A74H-01A-PR Redacted
