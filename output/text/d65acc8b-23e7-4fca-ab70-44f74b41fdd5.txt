Kidney, right; radical nephrectomy Tumor Type High grade renal cell carcinoma with exlonsive papillary. cribriform, and solid features, most compatible with a tumor of distal nephron/collecting duct origin; see note Tumor Sizo: Greatest diameter is 3.6 cm. Local Invasion (lor renal cortical types):  Involves renal sinus fat Renal Vein Invasion  Tumor invades medium to large size muscular vessels as well as lymphatic spaces in the region of the renal sinmus Surgical Margins: Free of tumor Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Mild interstiial chronic inflammation Adrenal Gland: Not identified Lymph Nodes: Not identified Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocyloma: pT3b Tunor grossly extends into the renal vein(s) or vena cava bolow tho diaphragm Note: The tumor exhibits multinodular growth, desmoplasia, and necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains are positive for CK7 (focal strong). Racemase (diffuse, strong). and 34BE12 (focal. weak), while negative for CK20 and CA-9. Allhough this tumor does Page t of 4

Entirely submitted for frozen secllon.. Summary ol sections: F$C - frozen section control 2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consullation. labeled "right kidney" and consists of a kidney with atlached uretor, renal vessels and perinephric fal weighing 180 g in lotal.. The kidney moasures 11 x 7.5 x 3 cm.The attached ureler. measures 2.7 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The allached renal vein measures 1 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter. The. renal vessels and ureter margins aro grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identified The kidney is inked black and.  bivalved to reveal a heterogeneous tan pink to golden yetlow infiltrating tumor that is focally very friable that measures 3.6 x 3.4 x 2.5 cm tocatod in the corlex with focal extension to the perirenal fat and atso exlonsion to the medulla and focally to the renal sinus fat. The tumor is not involving the renal polvic or renal hilar fat. Sections through the romainder of tho kidnoy revoal pink brown parenchyma wih a well-delined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.7 cm and the calyces appear normal No Page 2 of 4
