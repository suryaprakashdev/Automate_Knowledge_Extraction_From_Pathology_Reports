SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Surgical Pathology Report Diagnosis: Colon, ascending, right hemicolectomy. Tumor Histologic Type: adenocarcinoma, colon primary (see comment) Histologic Grade: low grade (grade 2 of 4, moderately differentiated) Tumor Size: 8.2 cm Tumor Location: cecum Depth of Invasion: through muscularis propria and into pericolonic adipose tissue, no definitive penetration or perforation of visceral peritoneum identified Lymphovascular Invasion: not identified Perineural Invasion: not identified. Margins: negative Proximal margin: 10.1 cm Distal margin: 11.6 cm Mesenteric vascular margin: 6.1 cm. Regional Lymph Nodes: Total number with metastases: 0. Total number examined: 16 Additional Pathologic Findings: Focal mucinous differentiation (less than 10% of tumor), no significant intra- or peritumoral lymphoid response, fibrous obliteration of appendiceal Iumen. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3 pN0 Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending. clinical review and additional information.. Immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair protein expression:. MLH1: loss of nuclear expression (abnormal phenotype), positive internal control present. MSH2: normal phenotype MSH6: normal phenotype Comment: Materials are submitted to the Molecular Pathology lab for microsatellite instability (Msl) testing. The results will be reported. separately. Clinical History: colon cancer. Gross Description: Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally labeled "ascending colon.". Specimen fixation: formalin Parts of bowel received: terminal ileum (10.3 cm long x 4.1 cm in circumference), large bowel (18.7 cm long x 7.2 cm in

circumference), appendix (4.7 cm long x 1.0 cm in diameter) and pericolonic adipose tissue (21.2 x 6.5 x 6.5 cm) Specimen length: please see "Parts of bowel received". Orientation: proximal mucosal margin=blue, radial margin=red, distal mucosal margin=black. Tumor location: proximal ascending colon Gross appearance of tumor: The mass is firm, pink/tan and fungating with raised borders and central ulceration. The mass involves the ileocecal valve.. Tumor dimensions: 8.2 x 5.1 x 2.5 cm (protruding into the lumen) Circumferential growth: approximately 90% of lumen involved by mass Gross depth of invasion: The mass extends through the muscularis propria and into the underlying adipose tissue.. Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: no Luminal obstruction: The lumen is obstructed and the diameter of the lumen at the tumor site is 1.4 cm Bowel circumference at tumor site: 8.7 cm. Gross distance of tumor from margins: The mass is 10.1 cm to the proximal margin, 11.6 cm to the distal margin, 3.4 cm to the Iateral edge of the specimen margin, and 6.1 cm to the mesenteric pedicle margin. Other comments: The terminal ileal mucosa is tan/gray and slightly granular. The uninvolved colonic mucosa is unremarkable. The appendix is unremarkable.. Lymph nodes: Sixteen lymph node candidates are identified ranging from O.5 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.0 cm in greatest  dimension. Other remarkable findings: none Tissue submitted for special investigation: Yes; normal and tumor given tq Digital photograph taken: no.

Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by. For cases in which immunostains are performed, the following applies: Appropriate internal and/or external positive and negative controls have been evaluated. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific reagents (AsR). These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by the. These reagents have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They. should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of  as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
