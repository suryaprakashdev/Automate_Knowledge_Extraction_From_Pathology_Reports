The specimen consists of a gallbladder. measuring 7.0 cm in length x 3.0. cm in greatest external diameter. The cystic duct is not present. *The opening is irregular and measures 1.0 x 0.6 cm. Approximately 0.5 cm away from the irregular opening. there is a transmural mechanical defect, measuring. 2.0 x 1.2 cm. The serosa1 surface is smooth and tan-pink. The gallbladder is inked black and serially sectioned. The mucosal surface is congested and slightly rough. No discrete mass or ulceration is present. The specimen is serially sectioned and no discrete lesion is identified. The wall measures 0.3 cm in thickness. No lymph node is identitied externally. Separately received in the same container are two irregular tan-brown calculi. each measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. On sectioning. the calculi are composed of tan-brown friable material. Representative sections are submitted in four cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - opening: cassettes 2 through 4 - random sections. B. The specimen consists of one portion of irregular tan-pink soft tissue measuring 1.4 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The external surface is rough. No discrete mucosa is visualized. The entire external surface is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show tan-white firm tissue. The specimen is totally submitted in one cassette. C/cpc. The specinen consists of the left lobe of liver and measures 9.5 x 9.0.

Requested by: Patient MRN DOB Date of Service. Performing Facility Ordering Provider. Result Provider Report Name :Surgical Report. Status :F DXSTIC x x 6.0 cm. The specimen weighs 390 grams. The capsular surface is tan-brown.. with multiple irregular bosselated tan-white areas. measuring up to 2.0 x 1.5 cm on the superior surface and the inferior surface. The surgical resection surface reveals tan-brown cauterization. Immedrately adjacent to the surgical resection surface, there is a segment of left hepatic bile duct. measuring 2.8 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The dista! end of the hepatic bile duct is marked by a blue suture. The hepatic duct has been opened by the surgeon. Approximately 1.7 cm proximal to the surgical resection margin. there is an adherent. intramural mass, measuring 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. (Please note: In the sections. the tumor appears to be on the outside of the hepatic bile duct). The iiver is serially sectioned and approximately 85% of the specimen is replaced by an irregular tan-white mass. measuring 9.0 x 7.0 x 5.5 cm. The mass is composed of lobulated tan-white firm tissue with focal hemorrhage. The remaining portion of the specimen shows tan-brown hepatic parenchyma with multiple small satellite lesions. measuring up to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The surgical resection margin is o.1 cm away from the mass. Multiple intraparenchymal bile duct lumina are campletely occluded by the tan-white firm tumor tissue. Representative sections are submitted in nine cassettes as follaws: cassette 1 - hepatic bile duct margin: cassettes 2 and 3 - possible adherent intraluminal tumor: cassette 4 - surgical resection margins. of the liver; cassettes 5 through 8 - mass: cassette 9 - satellite lesions. D. The specimen consists of one portion of irregular tan-pink soft tissue. measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. The external surface is shaggy. The specimen cannot be oriented. The entire specimen is submitted intact in one cassette. * MICROSCUPIC DESCRIPTION: : A. The gallbladder is appreciably thickened with prominent chronic inflammation and extensive thickening of the muscularis as well as thickening of the serosa. It is congested. No tumor is seen.. B. This consists of tumor without presence of uninvolved tissue. Sheets and nests of cells have small to medium sized nuclei which are slightly irregular in contour. The cells have predominantly vacuolated cytoplasm. In other areas it is eosinophilic with little or no vacuolization. Some areas have increased fibrous stroma. C/cPc. Tumor is present and similar to that previously described. This frequently has: intervening zones of fibrosis. It consists predominantly of sheets of cells with mostly clear cytoplasm. Some areas have a somewhat trabecular arrangement with a slight suggestion of attempted gland-iike formation however this is not well developed. No tumor is seen at the inked. margins. Tumor is present within ductal lumina in slides 7 and 8. The

Portal fibrosis is present.  Cirrhosis is not seen.. D. ' This consists of fibrous tissue with some adipose tissue. Areas of ducts are present within the fibrous tissue. No tumor is seen. --= SPECIAL STAINS: Special stains have been performed on block 4. . No definite tumor cells have positive staining for CA19.9. Where present, it is conststent with residual hepatic ductular elements. The tumor is also negative for pancytokeratin (AE1/Ae3). Where present. positive staining is consistent with residual ducts. Additional special stain results follow. There is staining of two of three portions of tumor for Ck7 and staining for Ck20 predominantly in two of three portions of tissue with some staining in the third piece. Only small numbers of tumor cells have staining for HepPar-1. There is strong staining for CK8/18 (CAM5.2). Staining for vimentin is present within some tumor cells. There is strong staining for alphal-AT in all tumor cells.. uAGNOSIS: A. GALLBLADDER: CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS WITH CHOLELITHIASISS 8. INTRALUMINAL MASS OF BILE DUCT: HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMAS C/CPC.

BILE DUCT MARGIN: FREE OF TUMOR A-MAI IGNANT (ETectronic Signature) - PATHOLOGIST CUMMENT: The tumor invades bile ducts but has the morphologic pattern of hepatocellular. carcinoma. The lack of elevation or staining for AFP does not mitigate. against the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma because this is seen in only approximately 30% of hepatocellular carcinomas. No cirrhosis is seen..
