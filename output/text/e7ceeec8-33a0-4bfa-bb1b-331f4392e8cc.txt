Entire report and diagnosis completed by ' COMMENT Please see for the results of prognostic markers.. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, BLUE, COUNT 8 - A single ovoid, pink-tan lymph node (2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm) is serially sectioned and touch preps made (touch preps 1-4) and entirely submitted in cassettes A1 and A2. TP/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT (B) RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, BLUE, COUNT 153 - A portion of yellow fibroadipose tissue (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm) contains a single fatty, gray to white lymph node (2.8 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm). The lymph node contains a 0.4 cm white nodule. The specimen is serially sectioned, touch preps 1-4 made and a frozen section done, submitted entirely in cassettes B2 and B3. *FS/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT. (C) RIGHT SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY, SHORT DOUBLE STITCH SUPERIOR, LONG DOUBLE STITCH LATERAL, LONG SINGLE STITCH DEEP - A right segmental mastectomy specimen, oriented by the surgeon, 7.8 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen was sectioned from superior to inferior in eight slices. Within the center of the specimen is a 2.7 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm well-circumscribed pink-tan friable mass, located at the anterior margin, 1.3 cm from the lateral, 2.2 cm from the medial margin and 2.0 cm from the deep margin.. There is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm nodular firm area in slice #6, possibly representing previous biopsy site, 0.3 cm trom the medial margin and 1.0 cm from the superticial margin. The breast tissue surrounding the mass is composed of greater than 90% yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses are identified.. INK CODE: Blue - superior, green - inferior, yellow - anterior, black - deep, red - medial, orange - lateral. SECTiON CODE: C1, slice #4, lateral; C2, slice 4, lateral; C3, slice 4, tumor and anterior margin; C4, slice 4, deep margin; C5, slice 4, medial margin; C6, slice 5, lateral margin; C7, slice 5, tumor and anterior margin; C8, slice 5, tumor and deep margin; C9, slice 5, anterior; C10, slice 5, deep margin; C11, slice 6, tumor and medial margin; C12, slice 7, tumor and anterior margin; C13, slice 7, media/anterior margin; C14, slice 8, interior margin; C15, slice 1, superior margin; C16, slice 3, representative uninvolved breast tissue; C17, slice 6, 0.5 cm nodule with anterior/medial margin.. (D) EN BLOC EXCISION, ADDITIONAL SUPERIOR MARGIN AND LESION AT 9 O'CLOCK (STITCH SUPERIOR MARGIN) - A tan-yellow tibrotatty irregular soft tissue fragment( 7.0 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm) with a suture at an edge of the specimen. The specimen is arbitrarily oriented in the form of a clock with suture designated as 12 o'clock. The tace of the clock has a tibrotic area (3.0 x 2.0 cm). The back of the clock is predominantly fatty. The specimen is serially sectioned from 3 to 9 o'clock. The fibrotic area seen on the face of the clock extends to the 12 o'clock edge and measures 4.0 x 3.5 x 0.8 cm. The remainder of the specimen shows fatty tissue..
