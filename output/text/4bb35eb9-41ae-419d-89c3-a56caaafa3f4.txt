SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT Patient Name: Accession #: Med.Rec.# Date of Procedure DOB: Date of Receipt: Gender: Date of Report Ref.Physician: Account#: Patient Address: Billing Type Additional Copy to: Ref.Source Clinical Diagnosis & History year old male with right renal mass. Specimens Submitted 1:SPRight renal tumor (fs) 2:SP:Deep surgical margin,right kidney 3:SP:Paracaval lymph node DIAGNOSIS: SP:Right renal tumor fs) Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma-Unclassified type High grade. See comment Tumor Size: Greatest diameter is 3.7 cm. This pertains to the largest tumor although multiple lesions are present.See comment Local Invasion (for renal cortical types): Not Identified Renal Vein Invasion: Not identified Surgical Margins: Tumor present at renal parenchymal margin (for partial nephrectomy specimens only) See comment Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Marked chronicinflammation and arteriolonephrosclerosis Adrenal Gland Not identified Lymph Nodes: Not identified Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma: pT1 Tumor<=7.0 cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney COMMENT: The tumors in this case exhibit a very unusual constellation of features that do not fit into any of our well defined categories.The main tumor mass is predominantly papillary and solid with focal tubular areas.It is high grade.Focal areas of necrosis are evident. In the adjacent renal parenchyma there are innumerable neoplastic foci that have tubular features and basophilic cytoplasm.These measure from 3 millimeters to less than 0.1 millimeter. It is these foci of disease that are present at Page 1 of3

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT the parenchymal margin of resection.The main tumor mass is immunoreactive for CK7 and focally for racemase.It is negative for CA9.The satellite nodules are immunoreactive for CK7 but negative for racemase. BAF-47 is not interpretable.The overall appearance is suggestive of a syndrome-associated tumor although the unusual morphology does not allow us to make this statement with confidence or to suggest the syndrome involved, if such is the case. Close examination of the contralateral kidney is advised Seen in consultation with Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH testswere developed and their performance characteristics were determined by theDepartment of Pathology.They have not been clearedor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments as qualified to perform highcomplexity clinical laboratory testing. 2. SP:Deep surgical margin,right kidney: -Benign renal medullary parenchyma. SPParacaval lymph node 3. Lymph Nodes: Not involved Number of nodes examined:2 with focal granulomas IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL).AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment RACEMASE CK7 CA-1X. BAF-47 NEG CONT IMM RECUT CK7 RACEMASE BAF-47 IMMRECUT NEG CONT Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation and is labeled "Right renal tumor".It consists of a 4.5 x 4 x 4 cm wedge shaped portion of kidney with a suture marking the deep margin. The margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a tan white tumor with large areas of necrosis, measuring 3.7x 3.5 x2.5 cm.The clearance from the resection margin is 0.5 cm. A representative section of the nearest margin is submitted for frozen section diagnosis.Representatively submitted.Portions of the tumor are submitted for TPS Summary of sections: FSC-frozen section control T-tumor M-margin RS-representative sections Page 2of3
