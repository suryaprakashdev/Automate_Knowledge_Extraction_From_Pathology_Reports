DIAGNOSIS (A) BASE OF TONGUE:  INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA. (B) TISSUE OVERLYING LEFT INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN: Connective tissue, no tumor present. (C) CONTENTS OF LEFT FUNCTIONAL NECK DISSECTION, TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY, TOTAL GLOSSECTOMY, RIGHT HEMIMANDIBULECTOMY: POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA OF SUPRAGLOTTIC LARYNX. (SEECOMMENT) LEFT FUNCTIONAL NECK DISSECTION WITH 1 OF 1O LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA AND SOFT TISSUE EXTENSION IN SUBDIGASTRIC COMPARTMENT, SEPARATE FROM THE PRIMARY TUMOR. ZONE 2(SUBMENTAL-SUBMAXILLARY COMPARTMENT): 1 OUT 2 LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA. Sublingua1 gland: Salivary gland, no tumor present. SubmandibuTar gTand: SaTivary gland, no tumor present. ZONE 3 (SUBDIGASTRIC COMPARTMENT): POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA IN FIBROCONNECTIVE SOFT TISSUE SHOWING LYMPHATIC INVASION. Eight lymph nodes, no tumor present. Right posterior soft tissue margin of mandible: Suture granulomas. with foreign body reaction.. (D) RIGHT PHARYNGEAL MARGIN, BIOPSY: Squamous mucosa and skeletal muscle, no tumor present. (E) RIGHT SOFT PALATE,EXCISION: Squamous mucosa and salivary gland, no tumor present.. (F) RIGHT NASOPHARYNGEAL BIOPSY: Squamous and respiratory mucosa and salivary gland, no tumor present. commenT: The tumor essentially replaces the entire vallecula with involvement of the epiglottis, right lateral glossoepiglottal fold, as wel1. as the right palatoglossal arch. The tumor extends to the epiglottic. cartilage and' is present in the supraglottic space. A discrete second tumor nodule on the left aryepiglottic fold is accompanied by underlying lymphatic permeation. Extensive tumoral permeation of !ymphatics alongside the entire mucosal margin or resection of the pyriform sinus bilaterally as wel7 as the anterior soft tissue margin underneath the oral mucosa. The tumor is Page 1 of 3 History Case Pathology Report History Case Pathology File under: Pathology

associated multifocally with in situ squamous carcinomas and varying aegrees. of dysplasias.. Grossly no tumor is appreciated crossing the mandibular. periosteum.  The anterior boney margin of segmental mandibulectomy specimen free of any tumoral involvement. DIAGNOSIS (A) BASE OF TONGUE: INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA.

COMMENT The tumor essentially replaces the entire vallecula with involvement of the epiglottis, right lateral glossoepiglottal fold, as well as the right palatoglossal arch.  The tumor extends to the epiglottic cartilage and is present in the supraglottic space. A discrete second tumor nodule on the left aryepiglottic fold is accompanied by underlying 1ymphatic permeation. Extensive tumoral permeation of 1ymphatics alongside the entire mucosal margin or resection of the pyriform sinus bilaterally as well as the anterior soft tissue margin underneath the oral mucosa.. The tumor is associated multifocally with in situ squamous carcinomas and varying degrees of dysplasias. Grossly no tumor is appreciated crossing the mandibular periosteum. The bone margins of resection wil! be issued in an addendum anort after appropriate fixation and decalcification of the mandibular bone.
