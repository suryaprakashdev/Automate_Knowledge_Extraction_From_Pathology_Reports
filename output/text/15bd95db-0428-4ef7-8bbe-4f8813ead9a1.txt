Further studies are being performed to better characterize it, and the results will be issued in an addendum report. 2.

The specimen is received fresh, labeled "bladder, urethra, urachus, perivesical tissue, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries and anterior vaginal wall'. It consist of a bladder, urethra, urachus, perivesical tissue, uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries and anterior vaginal wall measuring 10.5 cm from superior to inferior, 15.0 cm laterally and 14.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder measures 9 x 8.5 x 4.2 cm, the uterus measures 5.5 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm, the right ovary measures 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm, the right fallopian tube measures 10.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm, the left ovary measures 2.2 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm, and the left fallopian tube measures 9.8 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The portion of vaginal cuff measures 7.1 x 4.0 x 0.2 cm. The distal urethral margin and the vaginal cuff margin are shaved and submitted. The ureteric stumps measure 4.0 cm and are unremarkable. The specimen is inked black and the bladder is opened anteriorly to reveal: Mass #1 --  In the right lateral wall, is a 1.7 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm soft, ulcerated, ovoid tan-brown mass, located 2.5 cm from the left  ureteric orifice and 0.2 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On sectioning, the tumor extends into but not through the muscularis. propria, to a depth of 0.2 cm, 0.6 cm away from the deep margin.. Mass #2 --  In the right posterior dome, is a 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm, soft, ulcerated, irregular bordered, tan-brown mass, located 0.3 cm from the left ureteric orifice and 0.7 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On sectioning, the tumor extends into but not through the muscularis propria, to a depth of 0.6 cm, 1.2 cm away from the deep margin.. Mass #3 --  In the left posterior dome, is a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm, rubbery, pedunculated tan-brown mass, located 2.3 cm from the left  ureteric orifice and 4.0 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On sectioning, the tumor appears to abut the muscularis propria and is 2.0 cm away from the deep margin. A portion of this mass has been submitted to TPS. Mass #4 -- In the left lateral wall, is a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm firm, round, tan-brown, papilliferous mass, located 2.5 cm from the left  ureteric orifice and 4.2 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On sectioning, the tumor appears to remain confined to mucosa and is 2.0 cm away from the deep margin. Mass #5 -- In the lower left anteriolateral wall, abutting the trigone, is a 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm firm, centrally ulcerated, bosselated- bordered sessile, tan-brown mass, located 0.4 cm from the left ureteric orifice and 2.6 cm from the right ureteric orifices. On  sectioning, the tumor extends into but not through the muscularis propria, to a depth of 0.7 cm and is 1.0 cm away from the deep margin. In addition, located in the right lateral wall, is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm diverticula. The remaining bladder mucosa is edematous and congested. A possible discrete perivesical lymph node is identified and entirely submitted. The uterus is bivalved to reveal a roughly triangular endometrial cavity containing a flat, tan endometrium. The myometrium is smooth, tan-white and has two, E. rubbery, round tan-white mural nodules with smooth white cut surfaces, both averaging 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The left ovary is bisected to reveal a 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm unilocular, thin-walled, clear fluid filled cysts with a smooth tan-white inner lining. The right ovary and bilateral fallopian tubes are unremarkable. Tissue is submitted for TPs. Gross potographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted.

The proliferative rate with Ki-67 stain is low (<5%). Inhibin and GFAP  immunostains were also performed, but the lesion was no longer present in the slides stained. These results support fallopian tube  epithelial differentiation. The fallopian tubes were entirely submitted for histologic examination and additional abnormalities are not identified. The lesion is, therefore, best considered a focus of epithelial hyperplasia.. who concurs.
