SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled, "rectus sheet", and consists of one tan red soft tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted. Summary of sections: FSC-frozen control 2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled, "urethral margin", and consists of one tan pink soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted.. Summary of sections: FSC-frozen contro! 3) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, urethra, urachus, perivesical tissue and nodes, left rectus muscle". It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached soft tissue at the superior aspect measuring 18.5 cm  from superior to inferior, 14.5 cm laterally and 6 cm from anterior to posterior. A disrupted cyst-like structure, probably representing an organized hematoma is identified in the soft tissue, partially covered by skeletal muscle on the anterior surface. The inner  surface of the structure is hemorrhagic. The skeletal muscle portion measures 6 x 2.2 x 0.3 cm. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked black and the posterior blue; the soft tissue margin is inked green. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. A urachal remnant measuring approximately 6 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter is identified. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal seven cauliflower-like fungating masses occupying most of the bladder cavity measuring from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm to 5 x 6 x 4 cm, situated on the anterior, right and left lateral and posterior walls and dome. The stalk of the left laterai tumor is 1.6 cm from the left orifice and the stalk of the right lateral tumor is adjacent to the orifice. Both ureters are probe patent  measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. Serial sectioning reveals that the tumors are limited to the stalk and do not show gross invasion. Serial sectioning through the anterior portion /dome of the bladder reveals a perforation with a sinus tract draining into the soft tissue attached to the bladder, 0.2 cm from the hematoma. The remaining bladder mucosa adjacent to the tumors shows ulcerations. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are not grossly identified and the specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal unremarkable prostate parenchyma. The prostate is submitted entirely. TPS is submitted, photographs are taken.

Summary of sections: LN-lymph nodes BLN-bisected lymph nodes 6) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Necrotic pre-vesical tissue" and consists of multiple fragments of tan necrotic soft  tissue measuring 3.5 x 2 x 0.6 cm in aggregate. Representative section is submitted. Summary of sections: U-undesignated 7) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Abdominal wall hernia sac" and consists of a piece of ovoid-shaped tan fibromembranous sac measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm.
