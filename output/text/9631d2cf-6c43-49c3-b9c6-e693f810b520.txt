The specimen consists measures 11.5 x 6 x 4.5 cm and weighs 201 grams. The ureter and vascular margins are submitted in block 1.  The renal sinus/hilar margin is submitted in block 2. Sectioning into the kidney shows two masses.  The first is in the mid-posterior aspect.. This mass is brown and measures 3.8. cm in greatest dimension. It bulges against the capsule, but the capsule strips with ease from over the mass.. Sections of the capsule overlying the mass are submitted in block 3.  The mass does not grossly involve the renal. sinus. A section of the mass and renal sinus is submitted in block 4.  Additional sections of the mass are submitted. in blocks 5-8. The second mass is in the mid-lateral aspect. of the kidney and is 0.6 cm away from the first mass,. measuring 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. capsule, but the capsule strips with ease. Sections of the capsule overlying the mass are submitted in block 9. The capsule does not grossly involve the renal sinus.  A section of~the two masses and intervening normal-appearing tissue is submitted in block 10. Sections'of the second mass are. submitted in blocks 1l-13.  The pelves and calices are not. grossly dilated. The cortex averages 0.8 cm.. section of kidney is submitted in block 14. The attached A random fat is dissected, and no lymph nodes or adrenal tissue are identified.

[T-71000 M-82703 189.0 P3-44070] KIDNEY: Nephrectomy, Partial or Radical PROcEDURE: Radial nephrectomy. SPECIMEN LATERALITY:* Right. TUMOR SITE: Middle. TUMOR SIZE: 3.8 cm, 1.0 cm TUMOR FOCALITY: Multifocal. Tumor limited to kidney. MACROSCOPIC EXTENT OF TUMOR: HIsToLogic TypE: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. SARCOMATOID FEATURES: Not identified. TUMOR NEcROsIS: Not identified. HISTOLOGIC GRADE (FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE): G2, nuClei slightly irregular approximately 15 mm (nucleoli evident). MICROSCOPIC TUMOR EXTENSION: Tumor limited to kidney. MARGINS:  Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified. PATHOLOGIC STAGING (pTNM): TNm Descriptors:  N/A Primary Tumor (pT): pTla: Tumor 4 cm or less in greatest. dimension, limited to kidney. 'pnx: Cannot be assessed. Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):  Distant Metastasis (pM): N/A PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN NONNEOPLASTIC KIDNEY: None identified. COMMENT : The case has been delayed for iemmunohistochemical studies have been performed. as the differential would include an oncocytoma versus chromophobe renal cell carcinoma versus granular variant of clear cell type renal cell carcinoma.Stains support the diagnosis (Positive stains: Cytokeratin 7, EMA, CDll7, E-Cadherin, CDl0; Negative. stains: Vimintin, Cytokeratin 20). Control slides were reviewed and found appropriate. SUMMARY OF PATHOLOGIC STAGING: pTlaNX Intradepartmental consultation obtained.
