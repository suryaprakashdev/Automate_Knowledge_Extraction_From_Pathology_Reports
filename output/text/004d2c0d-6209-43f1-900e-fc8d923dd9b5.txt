DATE DATE RECEIVED WARD CONSULTANT ISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT COPY TO: SUPPLEMENTARY AND FINAL REPORT SPECIMEN: A. Right frontal tumour. B. Right frontal tumour. C Tumour. Further tissue sections of the glioma have been. examined, additional immunohistochemical studies performed, and Fish results finalized. Examination: of the additional sections of the glioma, which is now been examined in its entirety, reveals similar microscopic appearances to those initially report.  Variable cytoarchitectural patterns are evident, ranging from sparsely cellular microcystic, through to microscopic nodular areas where the neoplastic cells aggregate closely, and have a variably pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei, minimal cytoplasm, and demonstrates some nuclear angulation and irregularity. No areas of vascular endothelial proliferation or palisading necrosis have been identified. Maximal mitotie counts within the hypercellular areas, seven mitotic figures per 10 high power fields (field area 0.196 mm squaredl. The proliferation index, as judged by immunohistochemical staining for the proliferation marker Mrs I is variable.  Low-grade and sometimes microcystic areas typically have low MIs 1 indices, with relatively raxe nuclear labelling, but the small hypercellular foci demonstrate elevated labelling. Immunohistochemical staining for p53 protein demonstrates no convincing nuclear positivity.  Synaptophysin staining is evident in many of the neoplastic cells, particularly in hypercellular foci, and takes the form of granular cytoplasmic 0 positivity, sometimes with perinuclear dot like exenteration. There is no convincing positivity for NeuN, which highlights scattered mononuclear neuronal cells, which do not demonstrate abnormal clustering or cytologic features such as binucleation. Neurofilament highlights this non-neoplastic population, together with an entrapped network of processes of background neuropii. Representative formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections were submitted 9382/3 for FIsh (fluorescence in situ. hybridization] studies to assess lp, 19q and The results of the studies (which have been reported separately) demonstrated no loss of Ip and no loss of 19q, and Ecrr amplification was not detected. C71.0 In summary, considering these results and additional findings, this diffuse glioma is perhaps best regarded as a diffuse wHo Grade IIl mixed oligo- astrocytoma, conctusion: Right frontal tumor. wHo Grade IIl mixed oligo-astrocytoma, lacking ip and 19q deletions, and demonstrating no evidence Egrr amplification. Comment: Grading of oligoastrocytomas is a problematic area in surgical neuropathology. There is no specific grading scheme for oligoastrocytoma in the most recent wHo Classification of Tumors of the CNs. In grading oligoastrocytoma, many authorities now adopt the same grading scheme as used for oligodendroglioma. . The minimum criteria for a diagnosis of who Grade III anaplastic glioma in this setting are not well defined. Many authorities regard mitotic activity [greater than 5 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields] as a

valuable parameter of anaplasia in the absence of endothelial proliferation, palisading necrosis, or frankly anaplastic cytology and hypercellularity. In this case, overt features of anaplasia are not evident, but the maximal mitotic count exceeds 5 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields, and in hypercellular foci the MIs 1 determined proliferation index is relatively high. As such, the findings are int amount to a wHo grade III oligoastrocytoma. PATHOLOrr em. DATED: ELECTRONICALLY VALIDATED: END OF REPORT FOR Page 2 DOCTOR Doc. ADDRESS COLL. DATE DATE RECEIVED CONSULTANT HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORI COPY TO: SPECIMEN: A. Right frontal tumour. B. Right frontal tumour. C. Tumour. CLINICAL: Low grade frontal glioma.. MACROSCOPIC: A.  One piece of grey-white tissue approximately 6 x 6mm. A second smaller piece 2 x 2mm. Larger piece submitted for frozen sections and imprint cytology. A INTRA-OPERATIVE ASSESSMENT - FROZEN SECTION / IMPRINT CYTOLOGY: Glial neoplasm, grade 2-3.. Result phoned to B.  Multiple irregular fragments of tan coloured tissue with areas of haemorrhage and myxoid change. Specimen is sectioned and reveals a white and grey matter differentiation.  Several pieces of brain tissue. The largest measures 5Omm x 30mn x 30mm. Tissue is serially sectioned and reveals a creamy cut surface with areas showing myxoid change and haemorrhage. Centrally, the specimen is very friable and the tissue has a soft consistency.. MICROSCOPIC: A. C.  The specimens have been thoroughly sampled and show extensive malignancy.  In some areas it shows an oedematous appearance with a "fried egg' pattern and there is infiltration into grey matter with peri-neuronal satellitosis. The cells have round to oval slightly irregular nuclei with granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mini-gemistocytes are also seen. The background appears fibrillary. Elsewhere the tumour is more cellular and arranged either in sheets or in alternating hyper and hypocellular areas. The cells have larger, more pleomorphic nuclei, coarsely granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. 'Mini-gemistocytes are still present.. The background appears myxoid and there is microcystic change containing mucoid material. Scattered mitotic figures are noted.. There is no endothelial proliferation or necrosis identified. CONCLUSION:

A. - C. Right frontal tumour: Glial series tumour with oligodendroglial features. The cellularity, atypia and mitotic activity are consistent with an anaplastic oligodendroglioma (who grade IIl), cytogenetic. studies are proceding to confirm this and a supplementary report will be issued.
