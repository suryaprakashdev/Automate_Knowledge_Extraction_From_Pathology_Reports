Special Studies: Result Speciel Stain Comment AE1:AE3 NEG CONT IMM RECUT AE1:AE3 NEG CONT IMM RECUT AE1:AE3 Gross Description: 1).  The specimen is received fresh, previously incised and placed in formelin, labeled "Right kldney" and consists of a totel nephrectomy specimen with an attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat, weighing 642 g post fixatlon. The external surface has been inked black. The kidney measures 12.5 x 8.3 x 4.6 cm. The attached ureter measures 3.3 cm in length and 0.4 cm In diameter in greatest dimension. ' The ureteral margin is identified and appears grossly uninvolved by tumor. On opening, the ureter is lined by o pink-ton soft faintly corrugated tissue. The attached renal vessels are identified, with a slight srea of firmness Identified at the distal aspect of the smeller vessel, and the margins appear grossly uninvolved by tumor. The capsuler surface is smooth end pink-ian. The kldney is bivelved to reveal a pseudo encapsulated yellow-red tumor mass measuring 8.1 x 7.5 x 4.3 cm, occupying the superior and mid poles of the kidney, which appears to be partially surrounded by a rim of dense white fibrous tissue. The mass appears to focally protrude Into the sinus fat with possible focal invesion, but does not grossly invoive the renal peivis. At the cenler of the mass, an ill-defined frm white-ten focally hemorrhagic scarred erea is identlfied measuring 2.8 x 2.3 cm in greatest dimenslon. Focal areas of necrosis are also identified. The mass abuts the renal celyces and serial sectioning reveals possible invasion by soft friable red-tan tumor tissue. The attached perinephric fat has been inked black and on cut section reveals a focal area of possible extracapsular extension into the fat. The Inked margins do not appear to be grossly involved by tumor. Sectioning through the remainder of the kidney reveals a pink brown parenchyma, which appears grossly unremarkable. The corticomedullary junction is well delineated, with the cortex measuring O.6 cm in width. Sectioning through the perinephric fet reveals no grossly identifiable lymph nodes. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to TPS for permanent section and photographs have been taken.. Summary of sections: VM - vessel margin shave UM - ureter margin sheve.

The specimen is received In formalln, Iabeled *Precaval, paracavel lymph nodes and retrocaval lymph nodes" and consists of. multiple hemorrhagic lymph nodes renging in size from 0.8 to 1.7 cm.

The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right adrenal gland' and consists of a total adrenalectomy specimen, with. attached adipose tissue measuring 51 x 2.9 x 1 .0 cm and weighing 10.5 g post fixstion. The external surface is inked black, and serial sections reveal a rim of bright yellow soft tissue, with central areas of tan and dark red soft tissue noted. Representative sections are submitled.
