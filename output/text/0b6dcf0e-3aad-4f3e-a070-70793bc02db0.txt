tDo -3 Oidnseurc runs/$O 8 81403 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY lolentearsnwns in Case Number : thbulovesloe odnorn. 8 Qb3/3 Site Cecn C18.D Diagnosis: A: Colon, right, laparoscopic colectomy M ?//13 Tumor Histologic Type: colorectal adenocarcinoma arising in conjunction with tubulovillous adenoma with high grade dysplasia. Histologic Grade: moderately differentiated. Tumor Location: cecal pouch. UID:32360E38-C269-487F-806F-A3880DE9F3E LX-01A-PR Redacted Depth of Invasion: -Into but not through muscularis propria Lymphovascular Invasion: not identified Perineural Invasion: not identified Margins: Proximal margin: negative for malignancy; tumor is 5.2 cm from proximal margin (gross measurement) Distal margin: negative for malignancy; tumor is 14.6 cm from. the distal margin (gross measurement) Mesenteric margin: negative for malignancy; tumor is 5.9 cm from the mesenteric margin (gross measurement) Distance of carcinoma from closest margin (specify): 5.2 cm, proximal margin. Regional Lymph Nodes: 28 lymph nodes, negative for malignancy (0/28) Additional Pathologic Findings:. - Tubulovillous adenoma separate from tumor, 2.7 cm in greatest dimension with focal high grade dysplasia - Appendix with acute serositis.

Clinical History: -year-old female with right colon cancer. Gross Description:. Specimen A is labeled "right colon". Specimen fixation: Formalin Parts of bowel received: Terminal ileum (4.1 cm long x 3.3 cm in circumference), ascending colon (14.7 cm long x 5.7 cm in. circumference), vermiform appendix (8.1 cm long x 0.6 cm in diameter) and attached mesentery (22.3 x 8.2 x 3.4 cm). Measurement: Please see parts of bowel received. Specimen integrity: Intact Orientation: Inking: serosa overlying the cecal mass/blue, mesenteric margin/green Tumor location: Cecal pouch Gross appearance of tumor: Filling the cecal pouch is a tan/brown firm exophytic mass with well-defined rolled nodular borders. Also within the cecal pouch adjacent to the mass but not communicating with it is a soft tan/brown sessile polypoid polyp. Tumor dimensions: The mass is 5.3 x 4.1 x 1.7 cm (protruding into the lumina) and the polyp is 2.7 x 2.3 x 1.7 cm. Bowel circumference at tumor site: 7.7 cm Circumferential growth: Mass and polyp occupy the entire cecal pouch and adjacent luminal circumference involved is approximately 60%. Gross depth of invasion: The mass extends 0.9 cm through the muscularis propria, into the mesentery and grossly retracts the serosa, but does not extend through it. The polyp is confined to the mucosal surface.. Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: No Luminal obstruction: The cecal pouch portion of the lumen is completely obstructed, but the ascending colon lumen just distal to the mass is patent.

Gross distance of tumor from margins: The mass is 5.2 cm from the proximal mucosal margin, 14.6 cm from the distal mucosal. margin, and 5.9 cm from the mesenteric margin. The polyp is 8.6 cm from the proximal margin, 14.9 cm from the distal mucosal margin, and 8.1 cm from the mesenteric margin Other remarkable findings: The appendix is intact, curved and adherent within the mesentery. The serosa is purple/tan, smooth and glistening. The lumen is pinpoint with a tan mucosa. The appendix is uninvolved by mass and the mass is 1.8 cm from the appendical orifice. Lymph nodes: Multiple lymph node candidates are identified ranging from 0.2 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. Tissue submitted for special investigation: Tumor and normal are given to tumor procurement foundation.
