Pathology Number: Patient Nam Gross DescrIpTIOn Jesignated A The specimen is received in five separate containers labeled. through E. A. The container is received fresh unfixed labeled "left breast lump" and consists of a 30 gm. ovoid mass of apparent fatty and fibrous-encased tissue which is 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm. in greatest overall dimension.' There is a single short suture indicating superior margin inked with orange, inferior is inked red. There is a single long suture indicating lateral margin inked with black dye, medial is inked blue. There are two short sutures indicating anterior margin inked with green dye, deep is inked yellow. Sectioning reveals a tumor, a gray-white irregular bordered tumor which is 3.2 x 3.1 x 3 cm. in greatest overall dimension and has scattered yellow-tan chalky areas varying up to 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension and a central O.4 cm. slightly gelatinous hemorrhagic area. The tumor mass grossly appears to involve the lateral/black margin is 0.1 cm. from the medial/blue, 0.5 cm. from the anterior/green, 0.5 cm. from the deep/yellow, 0.5 cm. from the superior/orange and 0.5 The entire specimen is. cm. from the inferior/red. Gross margins are obtained by Dr.. submitted in seventeen blocks.. Key Note Block Summary: 1---lateral/black, 2--medial/blue, 3--- anterior/green, 4-. deep/yellow, 5---superior/orange, 6---inferior/red (all are perpendicular), 7 through 17---remaining B. The container is received fixed labeled "left axillary contents" and consists of an irregular mass of apparent fat 3.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm. Sectioning reveals pink-tan nodules varying up to 2 cm. in greatest dimension. The iarger nodes are hemisected and placed in cassettes 2 through 5. C. The container is received fixed labeled "additiona! axillary contents" and consists of an irregular mass of apparent fatty tissue which is 1 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. Sectioning reveals a 0.4 cm. pink-tan nodule. The entire specimen is submitted as one section in one block. D. The container is received fresh unfixed labeled "additional iateral margin' and consists of an 8 gm. ovoid mass of apparent fatty and fibrous encased tissue is 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm. in greatest overall dimension. There is an attached suture indicating new lateral margin inked with red dye. Sectioning reveais fat and a scant amount of fibrous tissue. The entire specirnen is subnitted in four blocks. E. The container is received fresh unfixed labeled "additional medial margin - suture on new medial margin" and consists of an 8 gm. ovoid mass of apparent fatty and fibrous encased tissue is 3 x 3 x 2.5 cm. in greatest overall dimension. There is a suture indicating new medial margin inked with blue dye. The entire specimen is submitted in four blocks..
