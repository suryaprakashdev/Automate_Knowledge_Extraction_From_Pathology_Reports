Entire report and diagnosis completed by: DIAGNOSIS LEFT NECK DISSECTION, MANDIBULECTOMY, FLOOR OF MOUTH ALVEOLECTOMY, AND RADICAL RESECTION OF FACIAL SKIN: MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, DEEPLY INVASIVE INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA AT POSTERIOR MUCOSAL MARGIN; ALL OTHER MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR. No metastatic carcinoma in eight lymph nodes. TUMOR EXTENDS TO PAROTID GLAND. (B) ADDITIONAL POSTERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION: FOCAL SUPERFICIALLY INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA. Margins free of tumor. (C) TEETH, EXTRACTION: Teeth with dental fillings. Entire report and diaanosis completed. GROSS DESCRIPTION ALEFT NECK DISSECTION, MANDIBULECTOMYFLOOR OF MOUTH ALVEOLECTOMY RADICAL RESECTION OF FACIAL SKIN -A 17.0 x9.0x 7.8 cm specimen which consists of a skin ellipse, underlying soft tissue, and attached portion of. mandible with associated mucosa and skeletal muscle. The skin ellipse is 10.0 x 7.0 cm and has a centrally located located raised soft erythematous nodule. The nodule is 2.0 x 1.8 cm. The skin margins are grossly unremarkable. The portion of mandibular bone is 6.0 x 3.0 x 1.4 cm and grossly uninvolved by tumor. The overlying mandibular mucosa/floor of mouth is pink-tan and slightly erythematous. The mucosa is 5.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. Attached to the Page 1of3 History Case Pathology Report History Case Pathology File under: Pathology

mandible is skeletal muscle, salivary gland, and adipose tissue. The salivary gland abutts a firm tumor but appears grossly uninvolved.  The salivary gland is 3.0 x 2.5 x2.0 cm. The attached 1ymph node dissection is 11.0 x 3.0  1.0 cm. The attached skeletal muscle is 5.0 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm. A 4.5 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm firm spherical mass is present within the central aspect of the skin. The mass extends to abut the outer aspect of the mandible. The deep portion of the tumor bed is smooth and has a 0.4 cm skeletal muscle margin in the deep anterior and posterior region. The central aspect of the tumor is partially necrotic. The tumor appears to be grossly away from al1 surgical margins. The salivary gland has an unremarkable parenchyma. Multiple lymph nodes are identified. The largest lymph node measures 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.. There are no matted or necrotic lymph nodes present. A representative sample of this sample is submitted for frozen section and a representative sample of the remainder of the specimen is submitted for permanent fixation. INK coDe: Black = medial soft tissue and medial mucosal margin; orange = skin margin and mucosal margin on lateral aspect; yellow = deep/inferior aspect. The anterior mucosal margin is designated as 12 o'clock and the posterior mucosal margin is designated as 6 o'clock. SEctIoN coDe: A1, 12 o'clock-2 o'clock mucosal margin en face; A2, 2-5 o'clock mucosal margin en face; A3, 5-7 o'clock mucosal margin en face; A4, 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock mucosal margin en face; A5,9-12 o'clock mucosal margin en face; A6, anterior skin margin en face; A7, superior anterior skin margin en face; A8, superior posterior skin margin en face; A9-A10, posterior skin margin en face; A11, posterior inferior skin margin en face; A12, mid inferior skin margin en face; A13, anterior inferior skin margin en face;A14-A17, remaining mucosa submitted entirely sequentially from anterior to posterior in a perpendicular fashion; A18, A19, skin with underlying tumor; A20, tumor piece of skin; A21-A23, tumor with medial and deep skeletal muscle margin; A24, salivary gland with adjacent tumor; A25, unremarkable salivary gland; A26,one 1ymph node bisected; A27, one 1ymph node bisected; A28,four possible 1ymph nodes. *FS/DX INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA AT POSTERIOR MUCOSAL MARGIN; OTHER MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR. B) ADDITIONAL POSTERIOR MARGIN LONG =NEW MID POSTERIOR MARGIN,SHORT= LINguAL MARGIn) - An oriented portion of pink-tan mucosal lined tissue which is 3.0 x 2.6 x 1.2 cm. The long suture is placed at 6 o'clock and the short suture is placed at 3 o'clock. The central aspect of the mucosal surface is slightly elevatedand erythematous. The elevated portion measures 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The deep aspect consists of smooth skeletal' muscle. INK coDe: Yellow = 2-7 o'clock; _orange =7-2 o'clock; black = deep. The specimen is submitted entirely following representative samples for frozen section. SEction coDe: B1, 2-4 o'clock mucosal margin en face; B2, 4-7 o'clock mucosal margin en face; B4, 9-12 o'clock mucosal margin en face; B5, 12-2 o'clock mucosal margin en face; B6-B10. entire specimen submitted sequentially from anterior to posterior aspect. *FS/DX:SQUAMOUS MUCOSA,NO TUMOR PRESENT. (C) TEeTH - Two molar teeth and two incisors, 1.8cm .9cm2.1cmand1.8 cm in length in length, respectively.  The two molar teeth contain a white and a silver filling, respectively.  Both incisors show what anpears to be porcelain grounds. The specimen is for gross only. Page 2 of 3 History Case Pathology Report History Case Pathology File under: Pathology
