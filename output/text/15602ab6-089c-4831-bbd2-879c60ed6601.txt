COMMENT: Part 2: The renat mass consists of an oncocytic eplthelial neoplasm with prominent foamy macrophages and. hemosiderin laden macrophages associated with hemorrhage. The epithelial cells are arranged in solid, acinar, and focally papillary architectures. The neoplastic cells have large nuclei with prominent nucleoli and round nuclear contours. A limlted panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed. The neoplastic cells are strongly immunoreactive for P504s (alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase) and are negative for cytokeratin 7 and carbonic anhydrase Ix. Parvalbumin  immunostain is equivocal, with a high background. The overall pathology favors a type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma. Parts 1 and 2: The renal cell carcinoma Is focally present at the capsular resectlon margln in an area where the capsule is not intact (? capsular incision) and the parenchymal resection margin on the partial nephrectomy speclmen. A microscopic detached fragment of carcinoma is present in the fat overlying the tumor (part 1). It is uncertain whether any microscopic residual carcinoma is present. Clinical / radiologic follow-up is recommended.
