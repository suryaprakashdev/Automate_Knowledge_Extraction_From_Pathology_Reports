Gross Description:. A.  Received in formalin is a yellow tan fibrotic adipose tissue fragment weighing 86 grams and measures 8.0 x. 7.0 x 4.0 cm. The specimen is oriented with a long stitch lateral, short superior and double stitch. Inked as follows: Superior in Blue -- deep black, anterior yellow, inferior green, lateral orange and medial red. Cross sections of the specimen shows a firm pale tan well circumscribed mass measuring 2.1 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm. It is.  within 1 mm from inferior resection margin, all additional margins are uninvolved by tumor. The mass shows a metallic clip (previous biopsy site). No additional lesions are grossly present. Sections submitted as. follows: Cassette #1-4  Representative section of the mass with relations to the inferior margin (almost in toto). (Cassette #1) -largest dimension of the mass, (Cassette #4) previous biopsy site Cassette# 5 Superior margin Cassette# 6 Deep margin Cassette# 7 Anterior margin. Cassette#8  Lateral margin Cassette #9  Medial resection margin. B  Received in formalin are multiple yellow tan fibrotic adipose tissue fragments measuring 15.0 x 13.0 x 4.0 cm in aggregate. Twenty-six lymph nodes were grossly identified measuring up to 3.0 x 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. The two largest lymph nodes show a metastatic tumor. Sections submitted as follows:. Cassette #1  Representative section from one large lymph node Cassette #2 Representative section from the second largest lymph node. Cassettes# 3&4 One lymph node in toto per cassette. Cassettes#5-10 Four lymph nodes in toto per cassette. C  Received in formalin is a yellow tan fibrotic adipose tissue fragment. It measures 10. 0 x 6.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. The five lymph nodes are grossly identified measuring up to 0.4 x 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. Sections submitted as follows:. Cassette #1 Two lymph nodes in toto Cassette# 2 Three lymph nodes in toto. hA13
