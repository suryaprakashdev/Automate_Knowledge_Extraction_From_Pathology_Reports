Histologic Grade: G1: Nuclei round, uniform,approximately 10 microns;nucleoli inconspicuous or absent. EXTENT OF INVASION Primary Tumor: pT1a: Tumor 4 cm or less in greatest dimension, limited to the kidney. Regional Lymph Nodes: pNx: Cannot be assessed.. Lymph Nodes: None submitted. Distant metastasis: pMx: Cannot be assessed. Margins: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. Adrenal gland: Not present. Venous invasion: Absent. Comments: Colloidal iron stain shows focal granular cytoplasmic staining consistent with the. above diagnosis. The tumor arises in an end stage kidney. Clinical: Right ronal mass. Gross: The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's namie the medical record number and "right kidney",and consists of a laporascopic radical nephrectomy specimen. The kidney with attached perinephric fat weighs yian.ppn ia mkc ibanu o u licvCa a well circumscribed tan and brown nodule measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. The nodule abuts the renal capsule but no invasion into perinephric fat is noted. Small cysts are noted within the cortex. The remainder of the kidney is grossly unremarkable. The renal mass is sectioned and. a portion is taken for tissue bank. No adrenal gland is present. The specimen is represented. as follows: A=vascular margin, B=ureter margin, C-F=tumor in tumor relation to kidney and perinephric fat, F=cystic areas and cortex and samples of cortex and medulla, G=section of grossly unremarkable perinephric fat.
