MEDIAL MARGIN LEFT BREAST INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: Part A, Left breast, wide local excision, gross examination: Tumor (at least 3 cm in size) seen at inked green medial margin TPB, Sentinel lymph node #1, left axilla: Negative for tumor cells Diagnoses called at '. by Dr GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. WLE LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "wide local excision left breast needle localization" is an oriented, previously inked, 63-g. 8 x 5.5 x 3.7 cm needle iocalized iumpectomy specimen accompanied by two radiographs. The single suture designates anterior, double-lateral. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial- green, iateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing firm tan mass (clip in slice 3). 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm, located at the medial margin. A second ill-defined hemorrhagic  firm area, 1 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm, is identified in slice 6, approximately 1 cm from the mass, and approaches the nearest anterior margin at distance of 0.6-cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. The specimen is representatively submitted: A1-A4: Perpendicular sections medial margin, entirely submitted A5-A8: Slice 2, entirely submitted, A5-A6 demonstrate mass A9-A12: Slice 3, entirely submitted, A10 demonstrates clip A13: Slice 4, posterior/superior A14: Slice 4, superior/anterior A15: Slice 4, posterior/inferior A16: Slice 5, posterior/superior A17-A18: Slice 6, hemorrhagic firm area submitted entirely A19-A20: Representative perpendicular sections, lateral margin B. SENTINEL NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "sentinel lymph node number one left axilla" is a tan Jymph node measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Touch preparations are performed. The entire specimen is submitted, B1-B2. C. MEDIAL MARGIN LEFT BREAST Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated *medial margin left breast" is an oriented (suture at final margin). 6g, 5.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm fragment of fibroadipose tissue. The finai margin inked black. The specimen is sectioned and submitted entirely, C1-C5. DIAGNOSIS: A. BREAST, LEFT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - INVASIVE MIXED (DUCTAL/LOBULAR) CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE II, MEASURING3.5CM. -FOCAL DUCTAL CARCINOMA-IN-SITU, NUCLEAR GRADE 2/3, SOLID AND  CRIBRIFORM TYPE WITH MICROCALCIFICATIONS. - FIBROADENOMA / FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES. - PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES.
