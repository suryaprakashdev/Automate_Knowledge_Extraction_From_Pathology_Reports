CLUSTER OF SENTINEL NODES RIGHT BREAST B. RIGHT BREAST MASS SPECIMEN(S): A. CLUSTER OF SENTINEL NODES RIGHT BREAST B. RIGHT BREAST MASS GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. CLUSTER OF SENTINEL NODES RIGHT BREAST Received fresh are four tan pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3cm to 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.6cm. A touch prep is taken. Toto A1. B. RIGHT BREAST MASS Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast mass" is a previously inked 23g, 7.5 x 5 x 2cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-blue, inferior- orange, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into 7 slices revealing a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1cm tan white firm well circumscribed mass, 0.1cm from the closest posterior margin in slices 4-5. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted: B1: superior margin slice 1 B2: slice 2 B3-B4: slice 3  B5-B6: slice 4 with mass in B6 B7-39: slice 5 with mass in B8 B10-B12: slice 6 B13-B15: inferior margin slice 7 DIAGNOSIS: A.
