Fine FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: A: RIGHT BREAST - INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA Results relayed to Dr. in person. GROSS DESCRIpTION: A. WIDE LOCAL EXCIsION RIGHT BREAST received fresh and consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 9.0 x 8.0 x 3.0 cm. The specimen is oriented with sutures by surgeon. Ink code: Red=medial lateral, blue-superior, green-inferior, yeliow-anterior, black-posterior. Sectioning reveals a firm, tan, well-circumscribed mass, 1.7 cm in greatest dimension in the mid portion of the specimen; the mass is located 0.8 cm from the deep margin. A frozen section is prepared (block Al). There is a second well-circumscribed, tan nodule, 0.7 cm in diameter, located 0.5 cm superior anterior to the main mass. Sections harvested for breast protocol include (1) mass, OcT embedded (2) mass, flash frozen, and (3) grossly normal breast from the medial end of the specimen, flash frozen (matching paraffin sections=Al and A2, respectively). Additional representative sections are submitted in sequential order from lateral to medial in cassettes A3 through A12. First mass in cassettes Al, A5, A6, A8, and the second mass in A7, A9, Al0, and All. l2cF. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER ONE "NON-SENTINEL NODULE NUMBER ONE" received in formalin and consists of two irregular fragments of tan soft tissue with attached yellow adipose tissue measuring 2.0 and 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. The fragments are bisected and submitted in their entirety in two cassettes, one node per cassette. 2C4. C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER TWO "NON-SENTINEL NODE NUMBER TWO" reCeiVed in formalin and consists of two irregular fragments of yellow, lobular adipose tissue measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension each. The fragments are bisected and submitted in their entirety in two cassettes, one fragment per cassette. 2C4. Page 2 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
