The specimen is submitted as follows: Submitted for frozen section 2 Remalnder of tissue G. Received in formalin and labeled *axillary fat (perm)" consists of yellow brown soft tissue measuring 4 x 2 x 3 cm in aggregate. The entire specimen is submitted in toto in eight cassettes. H. Received in formalin and labeled *skin right breast" consists of skin tag measuring 5 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm. A representative section of the skin tag is submitted in one cassette.. I. Received in formalin and labeled "right breast lumpectomy (short stitch superior, long lateral ) fresh" consists|of breast tissue mass measuring 186 grams and measures 9.5 cm medial to lateral, 5.5 cm inferior superior and 8 cm anterior to posterior. It is round to oval in shape. It is yellow in color and soft in consistency. The specimen has suture$ for orientation. The specimen is inked as foilows: anterior yellow; superior blue; posterior black; inferior green: Iateral orange. and medial red. Serial sectioning of the specimen reveals a well defined round to oval mass measuring 3 x 3 x 3.5 cm. It is hard in consistency. It occupies 20% of the entire specimen. The nearest margin is at the superior margin which is 1.5. cm from the mass. Remaining margins are away from the mass. There is an area of fibrosis which is situated anterior to. the mass; it is 1 cm away from the mass. The area of fibrosis measures 1 x 1 cm. The breast parenchyma i between the mass and the fibrosis is normal. The remaining breast parenchyma consists of the fat to stroma ratio 90:0. The cassettes are submitted as foliows: A  Superior margin 2 Inferior margin 3 Anterior margin 4  Posterior margin 5  Medial margin 6 Lateral margin 7-10  Representative sections of the tumor 11 Area of fibrosis 12 Breast parenchyma between the tumor and fibrosis..
