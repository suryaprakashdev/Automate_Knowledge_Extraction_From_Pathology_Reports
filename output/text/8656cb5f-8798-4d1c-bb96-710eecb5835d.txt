path report Microscopic Sections demonstrate a moderately to markedly hypercellular neoplasm composed primarily of glial cells with round to oval nuclei with obvious. processes. There are numerous large neurons admixed within the tumor. Many appear maloriented and some are atypical. One possible binucleate neuron is. seen. These findings raise the possibility of ganglioglioma. However, no. eosinophilic granular bodies are seen. In this section, the tumor has a more overt, diffusely invasive architecture. Numerous dystrophic calcifications are seen. A finely branching vasculature is apparent focally, but definite oligodendroglioma differentiation with cells with perinuclear halos and few cytoplasmic processes are not seen. No mitotic figures are seen in more than 25 high power fields. Neither microvascular. proliferation nor necrosis are seen. The tumor cells do demonstrate a focally prominent angiocentric growth pattern.. Addendum Only a few p53 reactive cells are present, insufficient to definitely classify the tumor as astrocytoma. MiB-1 activity is variable throughout the tumor. In many areas the labeling index is only 2-3% consistent with a low grade tumor.. However, there are large areas with significantly higher proliferation. In these, a labeling index of 8.1% is calculated.. Diagnosis Anaplastic astrocytoma grade III
