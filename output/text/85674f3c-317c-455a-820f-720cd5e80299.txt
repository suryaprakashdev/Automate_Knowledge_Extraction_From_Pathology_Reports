Diagnosis: 1. : Right hemicolectomy preparation with tumor-free resection margins; in the area of Bauhin's valve and the ascending colon there are a few tubular and tubulovillous adenomas with focal to severe dysplasia (synonymously: profound intraepithelial neoplasia), together with a poorly differentiated, mucinous adenocarcinoma in the area of the right colic flexure with infiltration of the perimuscular adipose tissue and without regional lymph node metastases (G3, pT3 L0 V0 R0 pN0 0/26). 2. : Further tubular mucosal adenoma with moderate dysplasia (synonymously: mild intraepithelial neoplasia). 3. : Highly differentiated papillary mesothelioma (without any sign of malignancy) in the area of the small intestinal serous membrane.
