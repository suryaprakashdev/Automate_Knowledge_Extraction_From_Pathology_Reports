PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: 2 %, POSITIVE, STAINING INTENSITY: WEAK HER-2NEU: SCORE 2+, EQUIVOCAL. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Blocks B4 and B7) using the following monoclonal antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1), Progesterone receptor (Clone 1E2) and Her-2neu ( Clone 4B5); control sections for HER-2Neu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF-7,. score 1+ T-47D, score 2+ MDA-MB-453, score 3+ BT-474). Detection system used: polymer. Primary antibodies, reagents and control sections for HER-2neu are all provided by. All controls show appropriate reactivity. Reactivity of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors is determined based on the percentage ofpositively  stained nuclei of tumor cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells. Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong.. HER-2neu reactivity is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Score 0 -- Negative: No immunoreactivity, or faint weak immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive.. Score 1 = Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive. Score 2+ - Equivocal: Weak to moderate complete membrane immunoreactivity in >10% of tumor cells or circumferential intense membrane staining in <30% of cells.. Score 3+ = Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform membrane staining. A homogeneous (chicken wire) patterm should be present. Equivocal results for HER-2neu (Score 2+) will be subsequently followed by a reflex dual-color ISH testing. The performance characteristics of these antibodics were determined by the. .

Page 1 of 1 Collect Addendum Report ASSAY PERFORMED: HER2 GENE AMPLIFICATION BY DUAL IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION USING THE INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA PROBE COCKTAIL 20 Number of nuclei scored: Total HER2 signals: 42 Total CHR 17 signals: 33 HER2/CHR 17 ratio: 1.3 INTERPRETATION: -/NEGATIVE FOR HER2 GENE AMPLIFICATION. NOTE: THE ASSAY WAS PERFORMED AS A REFLEX TEST AFTER THE HER2/NEU IMMUNOSTAIN WAS 2+. SPECIMEN TYPE: The HER2 Dual ISH DNA is performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin-cmbedded tissue slide from block B7. DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: The HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe assay enables the HER2 gene and Chr17 centromere to be co-hybridized and visualized via light microscopy. on the same slide. Specifically for this assay, HER2 is detected by a dinitrophenyl (DNP) Iabeled probe. visualized utilizing SISH DNP (silver in situ hybridization) detection kit. The Chr17 centromere is targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe and detected using. Red ISH DIG detection kit. Dual ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HER2 appears as discrete black'signals (SISH) and Chr17 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells serving as intemal positive control for staining) as well as in carcinoma cells.. SLIDE SCORING: Once an adequate target area is identified the reader records the scores for HER2 and Chr17 copy numbers that are present in 20 representative nuclei. If the resulting HER2 / Chr17 ratio falls within 1.8-2.2 (EQUIvOCAL) the reader is recommended to score an additional 20 nuclei and the resulting ratio is calculated from the total 40 nuclei. HER2 gene status is reported as non-amplified (HER2/ Chr17 < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17  2.0). The performance characteristics of this assay were determined by the This assay has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration.
