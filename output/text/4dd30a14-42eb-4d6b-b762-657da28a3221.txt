Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh labeled "right kidney, right adrenal gland and lymph nodes" and consists of a portion of fibroadipose tissue and a kidney with attached ureter, ranal vessels and parinephric fat weighing 667.5 g in total. The kidney measures 12.6 x 7.5 x 6.0 cm. ' The attached ureter measures 9.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. Tha attached renal veln. measures a 0.3 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal  gland is identified and measures 3.3 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm. Tha kidney is inked biack and bivalved to reveal an 8.6 x 7.5 x 6.0 cm well-defined, yellow to light tan, lobulated tumor mass in the superior portion of the kidney. Grossly, the tumor appears to be confined within the renal capsule and compress the renal pelvis without perforating it. However, tumor thrombus is present within the renal vein. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma with a well-defined. cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures O.5 cm and the calyces appear normal. The specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent secllons. Gross photos are taken. Summary of sactions: UVM -- ureteral and vessel margins T-- tumor THF-- tumor with hilar fat TSF -- tumor with sinus fat TK -- tumor with adjacent kidney. TRP -- tumor with adjacent renal pelvis, including tumor thrombus In renal vein RP -- an additional renal palvis representative section. K -- representative sections kidney. AD -- adrenal gland PLN - possible lymph nodes 2). The specimen is received in formalin labaled, "Falciform ligament' and consists of a segmant of Indurated fatty tissue  measuring 7.5 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a cylindrical white-tan fibrotic tissue measuring 2.5 cm in. length by 0.7 cm in maximum diameter. The specimen is representatively sampled..
