Part 3: Left pelvic sidewall, Biopsy - POSITIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA, EXTENDING TO CAUTERIZED SPECIMEN EDGES. PaRt 5: Omentum, ExcisiOn - POSITIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA. COMMENT: The carcinoma extensively involves the colonic wall, from the mucosa to the pericolic adipose tissue, but no definite. precursor lesion is seen in the colonic mucosa. There is extensive, plaque-like extramural/subserosal involvement as well, with areas of serosal penetration and at least one focus where cauterized carcinoma is present at what appears to be the radial and/or mesocolic specimen edge. This corresponds to the operative report describing dense tumor infiltrating the pelvic sidewall over the iliac vessels, through which the surgeon cut. In addition, immunohistochemical stains reveal the carcinoma to be strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 with only focal positivity for cytokeratin 20. CDX-2 is. completely negative, as are TTF-1 and PsA. CEA and cytokeratin 19 are positive. Positive immunostains for the DNA mismatch repair proteins MLH-1, PMS-2, MSH-2 and MSH-6 reveal preserved nuclear expression. In summary, the overall. morphoiogical findings and immunohistochemical profile are not typical of a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. A possible primary site compatible with the immunomorphological findings is the pancreaticobiliary system. Alternatively,. if another potential primary site cannot be found clinically, this could be a primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma with extension into the colonic wall. Finally, the lymph node total includes one lymph node confirmed to be negative for carcinoma by a negative cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunostain.
