Lymph node, sentinel node #1, excision: No carcinoma (0/1). B. Lymph node, sentinel node #2, excision: No carcinoma (0/1). C. Breast, Ieft, partial mastectomy: 1. Invasive ductal carcinoma, sBR grade 2, 2.1 cm; see comment. 2. Ductal carcinoma in situ, sotid and micropapillary types, 1 cm; see comment. 3. Lobular carcinoma in situ, classic type; see comment. 4. Atypical ductal hyperplasia involving fibroadenoma.. Note: Breast Tumor Synoptic Comment - Laterality: Left. - Invasive tumor type: Invasive ductal carcinoma. - Invasive tumor size: 2.1 cm maximum diameter. - Invasive tumor grade (modified Bloom-Richardson): 2. Nuclear grade: 2, 2 points. Mitotic count: <10 mitotic figures/10 HPF, 1 point. Tubule/papilla formation: Definite tubule formation in <10%, 3 points. Total points and overall grade = 6,7 points = grade 2. - Lymphatic-vascular invasion: Present (Slide C11). - Resection margins for invasive tumor: - Deep margin: Negative; tumor is 3 mm away, on Slide C5.. - Medial margin: Negative; tumor is 5 mm away, on Sllde C11. - Lateral margin: Negative (widely clear, >1 cm). - Anterior/superior margin: Negative; tumor is 6 mm away, on Slide C10.. - Anterior/inferior margin: Negative (tumor is widely clear, >1 cm). - Ductal carcinoma in situ (Dcis) type: Solid-micropapillary.. - Ductal carcinoma in situ size: Page I of^6

Surgical Pathology - Working Draft - DCIS present in contiguous sections, 1 cm maximum diameter (Slide C10).. - Ductal carcinoma in situ nuclear grade: Intermediate grade.. - Necrosis in Dcis: Comedonecrosis, focal (<1/3). - Microcalcifications: None. - Resection margins for ductal carcinoma in situ: - Deep margin: Negative; tumor is <1 mm away, on Slide C13. - Medial margin: Negative; tumor is 1 mm away, on Slide C13.. - Lateral margin: Negative (widely clear, >1 cm). - Anterior/superior margin: Negative; tumor is <1 mm away, on Slide C13. - Anterior/lnferior margin: Negative (widely clear, >1 cm).. - Lobular carcinoma in situ (LcIs): Present. - Number of lobules involved: Few. - Nuclear type/size: Classic, small cell type. - Lymph node status:. - Number of positive lymph nodes: 0. - Total number sampled: 2. - AJCc/UICC stage: pT2N0(S)mX. - Nontumorous breast tissue: Atypica! ductal hyperplasia involving fibroadenoma. In Slide C11, a few lobules show round shaped nucleated cells with powdery blue vesicular cytoplasm. proliferating within Iobule Iumens. Immunohistochemistry for E cadherin is obtained and is necessary to evaluate these cells. The stain is negative in these areas and supports the diagnosis of Iobular. carcinoma in situ.. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block C5 and C10. The test for estrogen receptors is negative. There is no nuclear staining in any tumor cells. Interna!. positive control is positive.. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is present. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is indeterminate for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block C5 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with stalning intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FIsH testing. The results of the FIsH test are issued directly from the moiecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with stalning intensity scores of 3 are consldered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of Immunohistochemlcal and Fish testing, and almost always show gene amplification.

Gross Description The specimen Is received fresh in three parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record. number. consists of one piece of pink-yellow, Part A, additionally labeled fatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is trimmed, and one candidate lymph node is found, inked green and bisected, entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1, and subsequently submitted in cassette A1. The remaining yellow, fatty tissue is entirely submitted in cassette A2. consists of one soft, tan-yellow, Part B, additionally labeled. fatty tissue fragment measuring 3 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is trimmed, and one candidate. !ymph node is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in. cassette B1. The remaining yellow, fatty tissue is entirely submitted in cassette B2. It consists of Part C is additionally labeled a yellow-white, fatty mastectomy specimen, measuring 3 (anterior to posterior) x 4.9 (medial to lateral) x 6.2 (superior to inferior) cm and weighing 21.3 gm. There is a yellow-white, firm, irreguiar mass, measuring 2 (anterior to posterior) x 2.1 (inferior to superior) x 1.5 (medial to lateral) cm, with a central stellate appearance abutting the anterior-superior and posterior margins; it is 1.5 cm from the anterior-inferior margin and 1 cm from the lateral and medial margins. The specimen is inked for. microscopic diagnosis so as the anterior-superior surface is blue, the anterior-inferior surface is green,. and the posterior surface is black. A portion of the tumor is taken for tissue banking. The specimen is serially sectioned into seven O.5-cm slices, from lateral to medial, and representative sections are. submitted as follows: Representative section of slice 1, lateral margin, perpendicular..
