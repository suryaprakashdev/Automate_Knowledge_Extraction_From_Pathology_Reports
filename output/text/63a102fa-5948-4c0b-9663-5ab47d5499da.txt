COMMENT The ER, PR and Her-2/neu (IHC) have been performed on surgical This case is discussed with Dr. by Dr. COMMEnT2  Immunohistochemical (iHC) stain for panKeratin (AE1/AE3) is negative for micrometastases in right sentinel lymph nodes (biocks FSA, A, FSB, B). GROSS DEsCRIpTIOn The specimen is received in three separate contalners labelec Jesignated A, B, c. A The container is received fresh unfixed labeled "right sentinel lymph node #1 for frozen section" and consists of an ovoid mass of apparent fat which is 1 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. Sectioning reveals a 0.3 cm. tan-gray firm nodule. Frozen section is obtained by Dr.. The entire specimen including frozen section is submitted In two blocks. B The container is received fresh unfixed labeked *right sertinel lymph node #2 for frozen section* and consists of an irregular mass of apparent fat which is 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. Sectioning reveals a thin rim of tan-gray firm rubbery tissue 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Frozen section is obtained by Dr The entire specimen including frozen section is submitted in two blocks.. C. The container is received fresh unfixed labeied *right breast lump' and oonsists of a 26 gm. ovoid mass of apparent fatty and fibrous-encased tissue which is 5.5 x 4 x 3.5 cm. in greatest overall dimension. There are two short sutures indicating superior margin inked with red dye, inferior is inked yellow. There is a single long suture indicating iateral margin inked with green dye, medlal is Inked blue. There is a single short suture indicating anterior margin inked with orange dye, posterlor/deep is inked black. Sectioning reveals a tumor mass 2.5 x 2.3 x 1.5 cm. in greatest overall dimension and grossly appears to be 0.4 cm. from the superior, Q.5 cm. from the inferior, 1 cm. from the laterai, 0.8 cm. from the mediai, 0.8 cm. from the anterior, and 0.5 cm. from the posterior. The entire specimen is submitted in sixteen blocks. Note:Gross margins are observed by Dr. . Gross margins are free. The ciosest margin is superior which is about 4 mmm.
