Pathologic findings in non-neoplastic kidney:  Glomerulosclerosis - Chronic interstitial inflammation AJCc Staging: pT1b pNx This staging information is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Comment: A portion of this case was reviewed in consultation with who concurs with the grade and stage of this tumor. Clinical History: -year-old male with right renal mass who presents for robotic partial right nephrectomy.. Gross Description:. Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally labeled "right renal mass." Requisition states "stitch marks closed collecting system." It holds an 89.8 gram, 6.5 x 5.2 x 4.3 cm partial nephrectomy. The parenchymal margin is tan/brown and inked black. Within the center of the parenchyma there is a stitch marking the closed collecting system, this area is inked red. The capsule is tan/yellow, intact, bulges and is inked blue. Beneath the bulging capsule there is a 5.7 x 5.3 x 3.6 cm tan/brown firm, well circumscribed mass with areas of hemorrhage adjacent to the capsule. The mass is abutting the red inked stitched area designated by the surgeon as a closed collecting system, is 0.4 cm from the black inked parenchymal margin, and bulges but does not extend through the capsule. The uninvolved renal parenchyma is tan/brown with a distinct corticomedullary junction. A representative section of the mass is submitted to Tissue Procurement. Block summary: A1-A2 - mass with respect to red inked closed collecting system, perpendicular A3-A4 - mass with respect to black inked parenchymal margin, perpendicular
