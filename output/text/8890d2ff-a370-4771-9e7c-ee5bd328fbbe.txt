RIVASYMCT O1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): Comment: The lymph node metastases seen in parts "p" and "c" demonstrate multiple foci of extracapsular extension and in most cases represent near complete replacement of the underlying nodal architecture. This case received prospective peer review. * * Report Electronically Signed Out ** / CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: female with medical diagnosis of breast cancer (invasive mammary adenocarcinoma, right breast breast; positive right axillary node). PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: None provided. POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: None provided. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name and designated, "Right Outer Breast Lumpectomy" and consists of an irregular portion of soft tissue oriented with a single suture - anterior; double - lateral; and short - superior.  The specimen measures 10.5 cm superior to inferior; 7.0 cm medial to lateral; and 3.0 cm anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked as follows: superior = blue; inferior  green; medial = red; lateral = yellow; anterior - orange; and posterior = black. Serial sections reveal a poorly-defined, firm tan-white mass measuring 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The mass approaches the closest margin as follows: 0.2 cm inferior; 0.5 cm deep and anterior; and 1.0 cm medial. The remainder of the specimen is composed of lobulated, yellow-tan adipose tissue admixed with a minimal amount of fibrous tissue and is otherwise unremarkable. Representative sections are sequentially submitted from superior to inferior as follows: Al- superior margin; A2-A4- adjacent normal; A5-A7- mass with deep and anterior margins; A8- mass; A9-A10- mass with deep margin; All-Al3- mass with deep, anterior and medial margin; Al4-Al6- mass with lateral, inferior and anterior margin; A17-Al9- mass with deep and inferior margins. Matched sections of A4 and A6-A8 are submitted in Ocr and Paraffin per Page 2 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974

? SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued) : CBcp protocol. Time in formalin: 28 hours. B: Rereived in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated, "Highest Right Axillary Lymph Node" and consists of an irregular fragment of tan-yellow adipose tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. ~Blunt dissection reveals an ovoid fragment of tan, soft tissue representing possible lymph node measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning of the possible lymph node reveals a tan-white, firm cut surface. C: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name ind designated, "Right Axillary Lymph Node Dissection" and consists of an irregular fragment of tan-yellow, lobular adipose tissue. measuring 10.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm. The specimen is blunt dissected to reveal 22 roughly ovoid fragments of tan-white, firm tissue representing possible. lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 to 4.3 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning of the possible lymph nodes reveals a tan-white, firm cut surface with. focal areas of hemorrhage. Sections are submitted as follows: Cl- five possible lymph nodes; c2- representative sections of four possible lymph nodes; C3- representative sections of four possible lymph node; C4- representative sections of three possible lymph nodes; C5- representative sections of two possible lymph nodes; C6- representative sections of two possible lymph nodes; c7- representative section of one possible lymph node; c8- one whole possible lymph node, bisected.
