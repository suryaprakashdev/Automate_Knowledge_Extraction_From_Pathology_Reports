[] m.D. Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the Resident or Fellow. Electronically Signed Out by [] M.D.. Clinical History: The patient is a  -year-old male with a history of bladder tumor. Bladder washing showed urothelial carcinoma. The patient underwent radical cystectomy and neobladder. Specimens Received: A: Right pelvic lymph node B: Left pelvic lymph node C: Prostate & bladder Gross Description: The specimen is received in three containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. Container A is further designated 31. right pelvic lymph node4. Received fresh and placed in formalin are fragments of yellow-brown lobulated adipose tissue measuring 8.5 x 6 x 1.2 cm aggregate. Multiple firm rubbery lymph node candidates are dissected from the specimen ranging from 0.2-5.5 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. A1-A3:  multiple lymph node candidates A4-A6: one matted lymph node candidate B. Container B is further designated 32. left pelvic lymph node4. Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple fragments of yellow-brown adipose tissue measuring 6.5 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. Multiple yellow-brown firm-rubbery lymph node candidates are dissected from the specimen ranging from. 0.2-4.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1-B3:  multiple lymph node candidates B4.B5:  one matted lymph node candidate, bisected C. Container C is further designated 33. bladder and prostate4. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a specimen of cystectomy weighing 395 gm and the overall measurement is 14.5 x 10.5 x 6.0 cm. The bladder measures 9.0 x 8.5 x 5.5 cm and the prostate measures 4.0 x 3.3 x 3.0 cm. The bladder is opened from the anterior wall with a Y-shaped incision. A gray-white, firm, ulcerated mass is identified in the posterior wall of the bladder measuring 6.3 x 5.1 cm and raised 2.8 cm from the bladder mucosa. Multiple small papillae are identified in the periphery of the mass. The outer surface of the bladder and the prostate is inked black on the left side and blue on the right side. Probing through the ureters reveals that both ureteral orifices are involved by the tumor. The specimen is serially sectioned. Both ureters are surrounded by solid tumor. The tumor displays a thickness of 5.0 cm. The tumor grossly invades through the bladder wall but not through the surrounding adipose tissue. The center of the tumor is white and soft and grossly necrotic. The prostate and the seminal vesicles are not grossly invaded by tumor. No lymph nodes are identified in the peri-bladder adipose tissue. Received in the same container is a 4.8 cm round tubular tissue with a diameter of 0.4 cm. Representative sections are submitted
