SPECIMENS: A. RIGHT COLON TERMINAL ILLEUM DIAGNOSIS: RIGHT COLON AND TERMINAL ILEUM, HEMICOLECTOMY - WELL DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON (MUCINOUS TYPE), TRANSMURALLY INVASIVE WITH EXTENSION INTO ADJACENT SOFT TISSUES.  TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA - FIFTEEN LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/15). - APPENDIX WITH NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC ABNORMALITIES - TERMINAL ILEUM WITH NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS.E - SURGICAL MARGINS OF EXCISION ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. COLORECTAL CANCER TEMPLATE Specimen Type: Right hemicolectomy Tumor Site: Cecum Tumor Configuration: Exocytic Tumor Size: 3.2x3.2x0.6 Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma, mucinous type - sections demonstrate infiltrating and dissecting pools of extracellular mucin, with associated tumor epithelium, consistent with a mucinous (colloid) carcinoma. Virtually all of the invasive. tumor shows mucinous morphology. Histologic Grade: Well differentiated Extent of Invasion: Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into adjacent adipose tissue and focally extend to within 1 mm. of the radial margins. Margins: Negative Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Present. Perineural Invasion: Present  Additional Pathologic Findings: The invasive cancer appears to be arising in the. setting of a tubular villous adenoma Extent of Resection: 0 Lymph Nodes: Negative: 0/15 Implants: Absent EGFR Expression: Pathologic Stage: T3 M0 MX SPECIMEN(S): A. RIGHT COLON TERMINAL ILLEUM CLINICAL HISTORY:  None given GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT COLON TERMINAL ILEUM: Specimen consists of a resected portion of terminal ileum and cecum measuring 15 cm. in length and circumference from varying from 4 cm. to 6 cm. An irregular polypoid lesion measuring 3.2x3.2x0.6 cm. is noted 6.5 cm. from the resected ileum margin and 7 cm. from the resected colonic margin. Appendix is identified and measures 3.2 cm. in length and 0.5 cm. in width. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette A1: distal margin Cassette A2: proximal margin Cassette A3-A7: sections through the polypoid tumor mass Cassette A8: random sections of the ileum Cassette A9-A10: random sections of the cecum close to the polypoid lesion. Cassette A11: terminal ileum
