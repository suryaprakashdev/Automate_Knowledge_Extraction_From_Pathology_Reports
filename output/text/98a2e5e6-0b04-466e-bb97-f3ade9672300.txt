Segmental mastectomy right breast single suture lateral, double long anterior E. Superior wall segmental wall right breast; stitch at new superior margin Posterior wall segmental mastectomy right breast; stitch at new posterior margin  Retroareolar mass right breast. H. Sentinel node #4 (300) hot and blue right axilla. CLINICAL NOTES Right breast cancer FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS A. Sentinel node #l, right axilla:. One benign lymph node (0/1). B. Sentinel node #2, right axilla:. Cne negative lymph node (0/1). C. Sentinel node #3, right axilla:. One negative lymph node (0/1). H. Sentinel node #4, right axilla: Benign (0/1). GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received unfixed for frozen section, labeled "sentinel node #1 hot and blue 84 right axilla" is a l.4 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm lymph node, bisected and entirely submitted in two blocks.. B. Received unfixed for frozen section, labeled "sentinel node #2 (237) hot and blue right axilla", is a 1 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm lymph node, bisected and entirely submitted in one block. C. Received unfixed for frozen section, labeled "sentinel GROSS DESCRIPTION node #3 (277) hot and blue right axilla," is a lymph node that is 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm quadrisected and entirely submitted in four blocks. D. Received unfixed for tissue procurement, labeled "segmental mastectomy right breast", is a portion of. fibroadipose tissue that is oriented with sutures as previously stated, and 8 cm. from medial to lateral, 5.4 cm. from anterior to posterior, and 4.0 cm. from superior to inferior. A mass lesion is identified, 3 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm., a portion of which is submitted for tissue procurement. Margins are inked: superior black, anterior green, inferior yellow, posterior blue. The mass lesion is 2 mm. from the black superior inked margin, and possible less than 1 mm. from the yellow inferior margin. Representative sections are submitted sequentially from lateral to medial, with D1 being the lateral margin, D2-d4 being representative sections between lateral margin and beginning of mass lesion, including representative deep

margin and debris of prior biopsy site, with D15 being medial shaved margins. A total 15 cassettes. Rs15.. E. Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled. "superior wall right breast" is a 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm.. yellow lobular fatty tissue fragment which has a suture designating a new superior margin. The surface is inked blue. The specimen is sectioned to show no other discrete gross lesions identified and the yellow lobular fatty cut surface. The specimen is entirely. submitted in 6 cassettes. As-6. F. Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "posterior wall right breast" is a 1.7 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm.. pink yellow rubbery tissue fragment which has a suture designated to the new posterior margin. This is located on skeletal muscle. The surface is inked blue. The opposite surface is yellow, pink and fatty. No residual tumor is grossly identified. The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted in one cassette. As-1. G. Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled GROSS DESCRIPTION "retroareolar" is a white pink rubbery nodule which shows gross evidence of bluing staining present. The specimen is 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.7 cm., having a single suture designating lateral and double suture designating anterior. The specimen is inked as follows: Superior orange, anterior blue, posterior black, inferior green. The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral to show a white tan whorled cut surface, shows white rice like pellets located in the inferior aspect of the specimen. The specimen is entirely submitted from medial to lateral labeled "1-5". As-5. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Invasive Carcinoma: Histologic type: Ductal Histologic grade: III Overall grade: 9/9 Architectural score: 3 Nuclear score: 3 Mitotic score:. 3 Greatest dimension (pT2): 3.0 cm. Specimen margins: invasive carcinoma is close to the margins in. the main resection specimen (part D): 1.5 mm from inferior margin, 1 mm from posterior margin, and 1 mm from anterior. margin. Additional margin specimens (superior wall, posterior wall) are negative for carcinoma..
