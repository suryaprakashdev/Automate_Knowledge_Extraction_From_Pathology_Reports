Pathology Report Accession Number: Report Status:  Final Type: Surgical Pathology Specimen Type: Colon Procedure Date: Ordering Provider? CASE: PATIENT: Resident: Pathologis PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: ADENOcARcINOMA, high grade, moderately differentiated (15 cm in.) greatest dimension). Tumor is located in right colon (cecum), is ulcerative, and has a pushing border. Tumor invades through muscularis propria into serosal surface.. Proximal, distal, and radial resection margins are negative for tumor.. Invasive tumor is 7.5 cm from proximal resection margin, 10 cm from. distal resection margin, and 2 cm from radial resection margin.. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.. Extramural venous invasion is not identified.. Perineural invasion is identified. Peritumoral lymphoid response (including Crohn's-like infiltrate) is. mild. Residual adenoma is absent. Immunohistochemistry performed at. demonstrates the following staining profile in lesional cells:. Positive - Ck20 (rare) Negative - CK7, CDx2, synaptophysin, chromogranin. Regional lymph nodes (positive:total): 0:35. AJcc Classification (6th edition): T4b N0 MX. NOTE : Immunostains for MLh1 and Pms2 reveal absence of nuclear staining in tumor cells (and intact nuclear. staining in non-neoplastic cells). Immunostains for MSH2 and msh6 reveal intact nuclear staining in.tumor cells. In most tumors with loss of mlhl and Pms2 staining, the defect is caused by. sporadic methylation silencing, and is not associated with a germline mutation. Less commonly, MLh1 and Pms2 ioss is caused by a germline mutation in the MLH1 gene (or rarely in the Pms2 gene), usually in the setting of a family history of colorectal, endometrial, gastric, or other cancers (Hnpcc). Colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency are associated with improved overall patient survival. Clinical correlation is required.. B. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "LIVER, BIOPSY" (including FSA): Bile duct adenoma. CLINICAL DATA: History: R colon cancer.. Operation: Subtotal colectomy.. Operative Findings: Not provided.. clinical Diagnosis: Adeno CA.. TISSUE SUBMITTED: A. right hemicolectomy B. liver biopsy O.R. CONSULTATION: SPECIMEN LABELED "2.

Pathology Report Bile duct adenoma. Tumor is grossly 7.5 cm from proximal margin and 10 cm from distal margin. SPECIMEN LABELED "1. RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY": (Gross examination only). OR Consultation by: Resident: The senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a gross and/or. microscopic examination of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the rapid diagnos(es) related thereto. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in two parts, each labeled with the patient's. name, unit number. Part A, labeled "#1. Right hemicolectomy", consists of a right hemicolectomy, including a portion of terminal ileum (7.0 cm in length), a seqment of right colon and cecum (22.0 cm in length), and an appendix (6.0 cm in length, 0.4 cm. in diameter), and attached pericolic adipose tissue (including a portion of adipose tissue consistent with omentum, measuring 30.0 x 16.0'x 1.2 cm). The proximal stapled resection margin measures 3.0 cm and is inked blue, and the distal stapled resection margin measures 4.0 cm and is inked black. The serosa. is pink and focally firm at the cecum and proximal portion of right colon (1l.0 x 9.0 cm), 7.0 cm from the proximal stapled resection margin and 10.0 cm from the distal stapled resection margin.  The specimen is opened to reveal an exophytic focally ulcerating irregular tan-yellow to pink mass (15.0 x 10.0 x 4.0 cm). The mass involves the adjacent ileocecal valve,. and comes to 7.5 cm from the proximal stapled resection margin, and 10.0 cm from the distal stapled resection margin. Per the surgeon, there is an "adhesed peritoneal folding designated as "true resection margin" (inked black). On cut section, the mass extends into the underlying colonic wall, and into the surrounding pericolic adipose tissue, coming to less than 0.1 cm from the black ink peritonealized margin, as designated per the surgeon, and is 2.0 cm from the closest radial mesenteric margin. Representative sections of the mass are submitted to the GI. stem cell lab for special studies, and additional representative sections of the mass and uninvolved colonic mucosa are submitted to tissue bank for special studies. The remaining mucosa is tan with normal folds, with no additional. discrete masses or lesions identified. Multiple tan-pink rubbery lymph nodes are identified within the surrounding pericolonic adipose tissue, ranging from. 0.2 cm to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. Gross photos are taken. Representative sections are submitted. Micro Al: Proximal and distal stapled resection margins, radially, 2 frags,. RSS. Micro A2: Appendiceal tips (bisected), and cross sectioned, 4 frags, Rss. Micro A3: closest mesenteric radial margin, en face, 1 frag, Ess.. Micro A4: Appendiceal orifice, 1 frag, Ess. Micro A5: Terminal ileum to ulcerating mass, 1 frag, Rss.. Micro A6: Ileocecal valve, 1 frag, Rss. Micro A7: Ulcerating mass to right colon, 1 frag, Rss. Micro A8-A14: Additional sections of ulcerating mass, with the peritonealized surface, as designated by the surgeon in A9-A13 (inked black), 1 frag each, RSS. Micro A15-A20: Whole proximal lymph nodes,. multi frags each, Micro A21: 1 lymph node, bisected, 2 frags,. Micro A22: 1 lymph node, bisected, 2 frags,. Micro A23: 1 lymph node, bisected, 2 frags, Micro A24: 1 lymph node, bisected, 2 frags,. Part B, labeled "#2. Liver biopsy", consists of a tan-red irregular soft tissue (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm), which is submitted in toto for frozen section as FsA. Page: 2 of 3
