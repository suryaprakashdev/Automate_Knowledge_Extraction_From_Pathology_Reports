Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT MEDIAL: RED ANTERIOR: YELLOW INFERIOR: GREEN LATERAL: ORANGE POSTERIOR: BLACK The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicularly through the anterior-posterior long axis to reveal a  partially demarcated, to ill-defined, dense, light gray tumor mass measuring up to 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm. The. lesion is grossly within 0.5 cm of the nearest inferior, 0.7 cm of the superior, 0.9 cm of the medial, 1.3 cm of the lateral, 0.9 cm of the posterior, and 1.7 cm of the anterior surgical margins. Representative portion of the tumor is submitted for Oncogenotyping studies. No biopsy site clips are appreciated. The remaining cut sections demonstrate soft to rubbery admixed, yellow-tan fibrofatty soft tissue without additional. discrete nodularity. Representative sections are submitted in a sequential fashion, posterior to anterior. Cassette summary: A1-A3) slab 1, posterior, A4-A7) slab 2, A8-A10) slab 3, A11-A13) slab 4, A14-A16) slab 5, A17-A19) slab 6, A20-A21) slab 7, margins trimmed and submitted, A22-A23) slab 8, margins, trimmed and submitted. A24-A25) slab 9, anterior margin represented. (with hookwire). Initially received in the B. Specimen B is labeled right axillary sentinel lymph node fresh state for frozen section analysis is a 4.7 x 4.2 x 1.5 cm portion of soft tissue. A localizing guidewire is present. Examination of the tissue reveals two lymph node candidates, 1.5 and 1.0 cm each. Both lymph nodes are serially sectioned and two touch preparation slides are forwarded for microscopic evaluation. The lymph node tissue is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation in B1-B3. Cassette summary: B1-B2) largest lymph node, sentinel node protocol performed, 82) smaller tymph node,. sentinel lymph node protocol performed. Initially received in the fresh state for C. Specimen C is labeled right axillary sentinel lymph node frozen section analysis is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 0.5 cm portion of yellow-tan fatty soft tissue. Examination reveals a single 1.5 cm lymph node candidate. The cut surfaces are rubbery light pink to dense nodular light gray. A single touch preparation slide is forwarded for microscopic evaluation. The lymph node is entirely submitted for routine histology in C1.. D. Specimen D is labeled right axillary dissection. Received in formalin are two tattered pieces of fibrofatty soft tissue which measure in aggregate 14 grams and 6.4 x 4.7 x 1.7 cm. Examination reveals twelve lymph node candidates ranging from 0.2-0.9 cm. The larger lymph nodes demonstrate a palpable firm-nodular architectures. Lymph node tissue candidacy is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation. Page 4 Case #. This report continues... (FINAL). Printed: Phone Patient Nt Patholoay Report - Page 4/5.
