Clinical Diagnosis & History:. Y/o male with left breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma (Idc)). Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Sentinel node #1, level 1, left axilla (fs) : UUID:E85199BA-6164-4CFB-AFAA-B41544883103 TCGA-AO-A1KQ-01A-PR 2: Sp: Left breast with levels one and two axillary contents Redacted DIAGNOSIS: 1) LYMPH NODE, LEFT AXILLA, SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #I; LEVEL 1; BIOPSY: - METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN ONE LYMPH NODS (1/1). . THE METASTATIC DEPOSIT IS SEEN ONLY ON THE ACTUAL FROZEN SECTION AND MEASURES AT LEAST 2 mm.  NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION IDENTIFIED. - THE LYMPH NODE EXHIBITS INCIDENTAL BENIGN CAPSULAR NEVOS CELL AGGREGATES . 2) BREAST. : LEET: MASTECTOMY: INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA. NOS TXRE. HISTOLOGIC GRADE IHI/III (SLIGHT OR NO TUBOLE FORMATION), NOCLEAR GRADE III/III (MARKKD VARIATION IN SIZE AND SHAPE), MEASURING 2.2 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION MICROSCOPICALLY. - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN-SITU (DCIS) IS ALSO IDENTIFIED, SOLID, CRIBRIFORM TYPE WITH HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE AND MODERATE NECROSIS. - THE DCIS CONSTITUTES <- 25t OF THE TOTAL TUMOR MASS, AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH AND AWAY FROM THE INVASIVE COMPONENT. - THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS LOCATED IN THE LOWER INNER QUADRANT AND CENTRAL AREA (RETROAREOLAR). - THE NIPPLE IS INVOLVED BY INVASIVE CARCINOMA.  A FOCUS OF PERINEURAL INVASION BY CARCINOMA IS SEEN IN THE DERMIS OF THE NIPPLE REGION. THERE IS ALSO FOCAL LYMPHATIC INVASION IN THE NIPPLE /Cs-0-3 REGION.  CALCIFICATIONS ARE PRESENT IN THE IN SITO CARCINOMA. Cavcinoma nifiPtratng ouctal, N0s 85o0f3 - NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE SORGICAL MARGINS BY EITHER INVASIVE OR IN SITU CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.S Site busot, N0s c50.9 - THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE IS UNRENARKAELE. THE LYMPH NODE STATUS IS AS FOLLOWS (EXPRESSED AS THE NUNBER OF POSITIVE LYMPH NODES IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LYMPH NODES EXAMINED) : - METASTATIC CARCINONA IN ONE OF BIGHT LYMPH NODES (1/8). - THIS IS A MACROMETASTASIS (1.8 CM). THERE IS NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION OF CARCINOMA. Continued on next page *.

The lymph node is bisected and submitted fox frozen section diagnosis. Summary sections: Fsc - 1 frozen section control 2). The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Left breast with levels one and two axillary contents, stitch marks axillary tail" and consists of a breast measuring 19 x 18 x 3.5 cm with overlying skin cllipse measuring 19 x 11 cm, attached axillaxy contents measuring i1 x 10 x 3 cm.  The axillary tail is marked with a black suture. Situated cantrally on the skin surface is a flattanad nipple maasuring 0.8 x 0.8 cm and araola measuring 2.5 x 2.5 cm.. There are no scars or lesions noted on the skin.  suture demarcates the axillary aspect. The posterior surface of the breast is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a well circumscribed stony hard whita-tan tumor moasuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm, and located 1.8 cm from the the breast tissue is yellow tan fatty and lobulated. The remainder of The specimen is Submitted for lymph node dissection. Representative sections are submitted. A sample of the tumor is given to Sumnary of sections: N nipple *+ Continued on next page
