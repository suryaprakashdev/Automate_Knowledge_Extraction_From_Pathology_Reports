Result Information Status (Last updated Date/Time) BDO NQS Edited Accession # 8170/3 perjslasias, focel msoluear Site sLsier 0gx.Z SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT *AMENDED* Patient Name. Med. Rec.#: Sex: Aacession #: Visit #: Service Date: Received: Location: Client: Physician(s) : FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS Liver, left lobe, partial hepatectomy:. l. Focal nodular hyperplasia; see comment.. 2.Minimal hemosiderosis: see comment. COMMENT: This report has been amended due to'a typographical error in the. diagnosis. The diagnosis and report remain otherwise unchanged. Sections reveal a circumscribed, nodular proliferation of. well-differentiated hepatocytes with associated thin, irregular fibrous bands' demonstrating ductular reaction and aberrant arterioles, which focally abuts the hepatic capsule. The hepatocytes show intact trabecular architecture wirhout cytologic atypia. Reticulin stain (performed on block A3) highlights hepatic plates ot 1-2 cel1 thickness and shows no loss. The surgical margin is negatiye. In order to further characterize the lesion. immunohistochemical stains were performed on block A3, with the following results in the lesional.. hepatocytes: - Glutamine synthetase: Positive in characteristic patchy, map-like staining pattern. -SAA: Negative.

- Crp: Focal weak positive; predominantly negative. -L-FABp: Positive (normal pattern).. -Beta-catenin: Membranous staining only (normal pattern). - In addition, an inununostain for CD34 shows patchy sinusoidal endothelialization near fibrous septae.. The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are those of excised focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). The non-lesional hepatic parenchyina shows few widely scattered portal. tracts with minimal predominantly lymphocytic inflammation without interface activity. Bile ducts are intact without injury or loss. There is no signiticant lobular inflammation, and no necrotic. hepatocytes are identified. Foci of glycogenated nuclei are seen. There is no steatosis or cholestasis. A trichreme stain (performed on block A5) overall shows no significant increased fibrosis; a few thin, periportal septae are identified, but these are focal and subcapsular in location. An iron stain (also performed on block A5), shows widely. scattered small, patchy foci of 1-2+ staining, predominantly in hepatocytes and also in Kupffer cells (scale 0-4), some but not all of which show periportal distribution... The findings in the background liver are minimal and non-specific. The pattern of minimal iron deposition is not entirely specific but may be. compatible with genetic hemochromatosis in this context. Selected slides of this case have also been reviewed by Dr. (Al, A3, and A4, including immunostains) and Dr. (slide A5, including iron and trichrome stains), who aqree with the diagnosis.. Specimen(s) Received A:Left lobe of liver-permanent (long stitch marks lateral; medium stitch maxks medial) (FS) Intraoperative Diagnosis Fs1 (A) Liver, left lobe, biopsy: Hepatocellular lesion, differential diagnosis includes focal nodular hvnonlasia and variant adenoma. Dr. .agrees. (Dr. Clinical History The patient is a year-old woman who, according to. ,has a known history of hemochromatosis (c282y homozygous) and developed a 2 cm lesion in segment 2 of the liver, and had elevated alpha-fetoprotein. There is no cirrhosis on imaging studies.. Gross Description The case is received in one part, fresh, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number, and additionally labeled "#1 left: lobe liver," and consists of a portion of liver (55. gm; 7 cm from right to left x 2.8 cm from anterior to posterior x 10 cm from superior to inferior). GROss ABnORMALITIEs: There is a firm, well-circumscribed, yellow-brown. nodule (2.2 x 2 x 1.8 cm, loated 1 cm from the parenchymal margin.

The nodule abuts the capsule and is 3.5 cm from the lateral edge. The vessels and ducts surrounding the nodule are patent. The surrounding parenchyma is uniformly pink-brown without other masses. No candidate. lymph nodes are identified. ORIenTeD By: Surgeon's sutures; short - modial, long - lateral. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Frozen section l; nodule, subsequently submitted in cassette Al..
