SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: A. Right breast, needle localization (Gross Examination only): Tumor O.8cm from nearest anterior margin. By Dr., called to Dr. at. C: Left breast, needle localization (Gross Examination only): Tumor 1.Ocm from nearest anterior margin. By Dr., called to at TPD: Sentinel lymph node #1, left breast (Smears only): Lymph node, negative for tumor.. By Dr., called to Dr. at. GROSSDESCRIPTION: A. RIGHTBREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION LUMPECTOMY The specimen, received fresh in a container labeled with patient name and designated as "right breast needle localization right breast lumpectomy" is a segment of breast tissue weighing 72gm and measuring 9.0x8.Ox3.5cm. The specimen is oriented per Dr. as follows: single stitch-anterior, long double stitch-lateral, short double stitch-superior. A metallic wire penetrates through the breast tissue from medial to lateral direction. On serial section, a 1.1x1.1x1.Ocm firm, stellate mass is identified. This mass is 0.8cm from the anterior margin, 1.5cm from lateral margin, 2.0cm from the posterior margin. The exterior surface of the specimen is inked as follows: anterior-blue, inferior-orange, superior-red,. Iateral-yellow, medial-green, posterior-black. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted from cassette A1 to cassette A26. Block summary: A1-A7: the mass and the anterior margin A8-A11: mass and the posterior border (A8 and A9 are 2 consecutive sections connected by the red dot) A12-A17: mass and the lateral margin A18-A17: representative section from the superior border A20-A21: representative section from the inferior border A22-A23: representative section from the medial border A24: representative section from the firm area adjacent to the lateral border A25: representative section from the firm area adjacent to the posterior border. A26: representative section at the area adjacent to the inferior margin B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA The specimen, received fresh in a container labeled with patient name and designated as "sentinel lymph node #1 right axilla" consists of 2 firm lymph node measuring 1.0x0.5x0.3cm and 2.0x1.0x0.5cm The lymph node is submitted in toto in cassette B1 and B2. C.LEFTBREAST LUMPECTOMY NEEDLE LOCALIZATION The specimen, received fresh in a container labeled with patient name and designated as "left needle Iocalization lumpectomy" is a segment of breast tissue weighing 75 grams and measuring 8.5 x 5.5 x 3.4 cm. The specimen is oriented as follows: single stitch, anterior; double stitch, lateral; triple stitch superior. The specimen is inked as follows: superior, red; inferior, orange; medial, green; lateral, yellow; anterior, blue; posterior, black. The specimen is serially sectioned and it reveals a firm, white_ stellate mass measuring 3 x.2.5 x.2 cm. Grossly, the tumor is 1 cm from the anterior margin, 1.6 cm from the posterior margin, 2.3 cm from the inferior margin, 2.6 cm from the superior margin, 1.3 cm from the medial margin and 1 cm from the lateral margin. The rest of the section of the specimen are submitted in cassettes C1  C27. Block summary:

SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA The specimen, received fresh in a container labeled with patient name and designated as "sentinel lymph node #1 left axilla" consists of a fibroadipose fragment of tissue measuring 6.0x3.0x1.Ocm. Within the tissue, 1 lymph node is identified measuring 1.3x1.2x1.Ocm. Touch prep is prepared. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette D1-D3. DIAGNOSIS: A. RIGHT BREAST, NEEDLE LOCALIZED EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: - INVASIVE MAMMARY CARCINOMA, TUBULOLOBULAR TYPE, MODIFIED SBR GRADE I - TUMOR IS 1.8 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION MEASURED MICROSCOPICALLY - FINAL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR - SEE SYNOPTIC TEMPLATE AND COMMENT - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, LOW NUCLEAR GRADE, SOLID TYPEE - FINAL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF DCIS - DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA (USUAL TYPE), AND COLUMNAR CELL CHANGEE WITH COLUMNAR CELL HYPERPLASIA. - FIBROSIS, FAT NECROSIS AND HEMOSIDERIN CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR br BIOPSY SITE CHANGE. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE, #1 RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY: - ONE LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1)  C. LEFT BREAST, NEEDLE LOCALIZED EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, MODIFIED SBR GRADE II - TUMOR IS 3.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION - FINAL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR - SEE SYNOPTIC TEMPLATE - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE, SOLID TYPE - SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF DCIS - FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA (USUAL TYPE) - COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE AND COLUMNAR CELL HYPERPLASIA - BENIGN INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA - FIBROSIS SUGGESTIVE OF PRIOR BIOPSY SITE CHANGE D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE, #1 LEFT AXiLLA, BIOPSY: - ONE LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1) COMmENT: The invasive tumor present in the_right breast (specimen) shows a morphology that is predominantly.that of lobular carcinoma. In many areas, however, and particularly on slide A5 the tumor shows small tubular structures with angulated contours and apocrine snouting. This combined  morphology is that of tubulolobular carcinoma. This tumor was e-cadherin positive on the original biopsy, a finding that normally favors ductal carcinoma. Tubulolobular carcinoma, however, has been reported to be e-cadherin positive also. Since the WHO currently includes. tubulolobular carcinoma as a variant of lobular carcinoma, that is how it is listed on the synoptic template since there is no option for tubulolobular carcinoma in that template.
