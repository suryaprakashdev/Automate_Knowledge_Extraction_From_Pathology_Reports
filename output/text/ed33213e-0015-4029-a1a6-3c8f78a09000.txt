1). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Sentinel node number one, level 1, left axilla" and consists of a single lymph node measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is bisected.. Entirely submitted for frozen section.. Summary of sections: FSC  -- frozen section control. 2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled. "Sentinel node number two, level 1, left axilla" and consists of two lymph nodes measuring 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.5 and 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The larger lymph node is inked black. Entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: Fsc -- frozen section control. 3). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Sentinel node number three, level 1, left axilla" and consists of a single. lymph node measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. Lymph node is bisected. Entirely submitted for frozen section. Surmary of sections: Fsc --' frozen section control. 4). The specimen is received fresh labeled, "left breast, stitch marks axillary tail" and consists of a breast with attached axillary tail. The breast measures 28.0 x 25.0 x 5.0 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 22.0 x 10.0 cm. Situated eccentrically on the skin surface is a nipple measuring 1.2 x 1.2 cm and areola measuring 2.0 x 2.0 cm. A suture demarcates the axillary tail which measures 6.0 x 5.0 cm.  The posterior surface of. the breast is inked black, anterior superior - blue, anterior inferior - green and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a firm quadrant extending to the upper outer quadrant, measuring 2.0 cm from the closest deep margin. The remaining breast tissue shows a fibrofatty cut surface.  The axillary tissue is dissected to reveal a lymph node Representative sections are submitted, including the lymph node.
