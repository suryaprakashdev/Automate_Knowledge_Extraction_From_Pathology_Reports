SUrgICAL PAtHOLOGy REPOrt - COnTInUeD Patient:  Result ID Accession:  Margins: Margins of main specimen uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (see Comment).. Renal parenchymal margin: Negative Perinephric fat margin: Negative Gerota's fascial margin:  Negative Renal vein margin:  Negative Renal artery margin: Negative Ureteral margin Negative Lymphovascular invasion: Present Additional findings: Adrenal gland: Uninvolved Pathoiogic Tumor Stage: pT3a pN1 Comment: While the margins of the main specimen are uninvolved, tumor is seen at the inked surgical margins  surrounding the larger of the pericaval lymph nodes (specimen #2). The tumor is composed of papillary structures with. fibrovascular cores, which are lined by tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm and large, slightly irregular nuclei with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli.. Pathologist, Electronic Signature. Intradepartmental consultation: Specimen(s) SuBmItteD: GrOss DescriptiOn 1. Right kidney mass: In formalin labeled *right kidney mass" is a 15 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm kidney with abundant attached perinephric fat weight 1,721 grams in aggregate. There is 3.5 cm ureter extending from the renal hilum. The kidney is bivalved to reveal an ill defined 8.5 cm in greatest dimension variegated tan-white to red nodular tumor within the. superior pole. On cut section, the tumor grossly appears to possibly extend into the perinephric fat at the superior pole. The tining of the renal pelvis is grey-white and slightly bosselated. Upon sectioning it appears that the tumor elevates the urothelium and it is unclear at gross dissection whether the tumor penetrates through the urothelium into the renal peivis. The tumor also grossly extends into the renal artery, lying 5mm from the renal artery resection margin. The remaining renal parenchyma is pale tan-pink with an ill defined corticomedullary junction. There is a small portion of adrenal gland at the most superior aspect of the specimen with an orange red cut surface. The gland grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor. The perinephric fat is inked black. Representative sections are submitted in eight cassettes as labeled: A vascular and ureter margins, B tumor to include perinephric fat, C-D tumor to include renal pelvis, E tumor to include renal artery, F tumor to include uninvolved renal parenchyma, G normal renal parenchyma, H adrenal gland. 2. Peri-caval node: In formalin labeled "peri-caval node" are two nodular tan-pink tissues which measure 3.5 x 3 x 2.3 cm and 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The larger tissue is inked blue and the smaller tissue is inked black. Sectioning of the larger tissue reveais a slightly friable and partially cystic tan-pink cut surface containing coagulated blood. Sectioning of the smaller tissue reveals a partially cystic red-brown cut surface containing coagulated blood. Representative sections are submited in 4 cassettes as follows: A-B entire smaller tissue, C-D larger tissue.. 3. Gallbladder: in formalin labeled "gallbladder" is a 9.5 x 5 x 2.8 cm intact gallbladder. The serosa is tan-pink and dull. The cystic duct is 0.3 cm in diameter and patent. The gallbtadder wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa is velvety yellow-red with diffuse yellow stippling within the body. The lumen contains tan-yellow viscous bile and a 2.5 cm green-black granular cholelith. Representative sections to.include the cystic duct margin (inked black) are submitted in One cassette.
