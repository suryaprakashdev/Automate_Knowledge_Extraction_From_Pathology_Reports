Source Clinical Diagnosis & History: Metastatic left RCC. Specinens Submitted: 1: SP: Kidney. adrenal gland and hilar lymph nodes, lelt: Radical nephrectomy. 2: SP: Lymph nodes, periaortic, Dissection DIAGNOSIS: SP: Kidney, adrenat gland and hilar lymph nodos, left; Radical nephrectomy: Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma, high grade, with lubulopapillary features (SEE NOTE). Fuhrman Nuclear Grade:  Nucleur grade IV/IV Tumor Size: Greatest diameter is 8.5 cm Local Invasion (ior renal cortical lypes): Involves renal hilar fat. Renat Vein Invasion: Angiolymphatic invasion is identified in small vessels and segmental branch of the renal vein. Surgical Margins: Free of tumor Non-Neoplastic Kidney. A PAS stain demonstrates mild arterionephrosclerosis.. Adrenal Gland: Involved by metastatic carcinoma Lymph Nodes:  Number of metastatic nodos:7 Number of nodes exanined:7 which includes nodular lumor deposits suggestive of lymph nodes entirely replaced by tumor. Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma:.  pT3b Tunor grossly extends into the renal vein(s) or vena cava below the diaphragm NOTE: Inmunohistochemical stains show positive staining for racemase while CK7, CD10 and CAIX are negative. The differential diagnosis includes a tumor of the distal nephron, collecting duct carcinoma, and type 2 papillary carcinoma; however renal cell Page i of 3

Melastalic renal cell carcinoma similar to pad one. Number of lymph nodes examined: 10 Nurnber of lymph nodes with metastatic disease: 4. Sizo of the largest lymph node involved by tumor: 3cm.. Sizeof the largest metastalic focus : 3 cm. Extranodal extension is identified Note: Some of Ihe inmunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and Iheir periormance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Those tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be Stigational or for research.

RACEMASE CK7 CD10 IMM RECUT NEG CONT H&E(US) RECUT RECUT RECUT RECUT Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh labeled "Left kidney with hilar lymph nodes" and consists of a kidney wilh allached ureler, renal. vessels and perinephric fat weighing 307 g in lolal. The kidney measures 11 x 5 x 4.5 cm. The attached ureler measures 9 cn in length and 0.3 cm in diameter The attached renal vein measures 12 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameler. The renal vessels and ureler margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is identified measuring 5 x 2.3 x 1.4 cm and has a nodular bright yellow cut surface, as well as a 2.3 cm tan solid lesion, grossly identicat to the kidney tumor. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to. reveal a 6.5 x 3.9 x 3.2 cm solid nomogenous fleshy tan somewhat nodular mass located in the upper to mid portion of the kidney, centered at the cortico medullary junction. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a welldetined corlico-medullary junction. The cortex measures 1 cm and the calyces appear normal. Several grossly positive lymph nodes are identified in the hilum, measuring up to 3 2 cm, wilh renal vein present in the mid. hem (the main renal vein is not  involved grossiy). The specimen is photographed. Ropresentative sections are submitted fo (bolh kidney and lymph nodes) and for permanent sections. Summary of sections:. UVM -- ureteral and vessel margins Page ? of 3
