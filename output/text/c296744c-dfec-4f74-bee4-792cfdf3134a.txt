Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND: CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FURHMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3. TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. TUMOR MEASURES 18.0 X 16.0 X 8.5 CM. LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION PRESENT. Vascular, ureteral and soft tissue margins of resection free of tumor.. Four lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/4). Adrenal gland, no tumor present. B) PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODES: Five lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/5). GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A nephrectomy specimen (21.0 x 16.0 x 9.0 cm) including a small rim of remaining normal kidney (5.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm), a segment of renal artery, renal vein, and ureter (17.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in average diameter), and fragments of the adrenal gland (4.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm in aggregate).. There is an 18.0 x 16.0 x 8.5 cm well-circumscribed tumor replacing the majority of the kidney and leaving only a small. remaining inferior/lower pole of kidney. The tumor is pink-tan with extensive areas of hemorrhage (5.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm) and. necrosis (9.0 x 8.0 x 7.0 cm), which is predominantly within the center of the tumor. The tumor is confined to the kidney and does not invade sinus adipose tissue or the renal vein. The tumor does not extend into Gerota's fascia. The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. Four lymph nodes are identified within the hilum of the kidney, all measuring approximately 2.0 cm. Serial cross-sections of the adrenal gland fragments show unremarkable cortex or medulla.. Portions of the tumor have been submitted for possible electron microscopy. Sections of tumor and normal kidney have been submitted to the tumor bank. Photographs of the specimen have been taken. INK CODE: Black - Gerota's fascia. SECTION CODE: A1, renal artery, vein and ureter margins, en face with one lymph node; A2, section of adrenal gland; A3-A5, tumor with capsule; A6-A8, tumor with normal kidney; A9-A11, tumor with necrosis; A12-A13, tumor with pelvis; A14, normal kidney; A15, one lymph node; A16-A17, one lymph node; A18-A19, one lymph node. (B) PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODES - Five lymph nodes are identified, ranging from 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm to 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. SECTION CODE: B1, three lymph nodes; B2, one lymph node serially sectioned; B3, one lymph node.. CLINICAL HISTORY Left renal mass SNOMED CODES
