APPENDIX, APPENDECTOMY:  Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia -No malignancy identified NOTE: Pancytokeratin immunostain performed on all lymph node specimens (B-I) is negative. Synaptophysin aad chromogranin performed on blocks A9 (section of the tumor) are uniformly negative. HISTORY: Cervical cancer MICROSCOPIC: See diagnosis. GROSS: A. UTERUS AND CERVIX Labeled with the patient's name, labeled *uterus and cervix". and received in formalin is a symmetric 135 gram total  abdominal hysterectomy specimen without bilateral adnexa which measures 9.0 cm from fundus to ectocervix, 6.0 cm from comu to cormu and 3.7 cm from anterior to posterior. The serosal surface is tan-pink smooth and glistening without gross pathologic lesion. There is a large firm fungating mass with heaped edges involving the entire circumference of the cervix and invading along the endocervical canal which measures in total length 3.0 cm, in total diameter 5.0 cm and it is difficult to measure the maximal thickness. There is a rim of vaginal cuff extending. 2.0 cm from the posterior margin of the cervix and 1.5 cm from the anterior margin of the cervix which has been.  previously inked blue on the anterior and black on the posterior surface. The endometrium measures from fundus to the edge of the fungating mass on the ectocervix, 7.0 cm x 4.0 cm. The endocervical canal has a maximum length of 5.0 cm. The endometrium demonstrates a smooth. firm tan-white mucosa without gross pathologic lesion. The endocervical canal, transformation zone and entire cervix appears to be involved by the tumor. The endometrium measures a maximum thickness of a 0.2 cm. and the myometrium demonstrates a maximal thickness of 1.7 cm. Sectioning of the anterior portion of the cervix demonstrates a fiumgating tunor that appears to involve slightly. greater than 50% of the cervical wall but does not penetrate through to the serosal surface. Sectioning of the anterior corpus demonstrates a homogeneous tan-pink parenchyma without gross pathologic lesion. Sectioning of the posterior cervix demonstrates a firm, friable tan-white mass involving approximately slightly greater than 50% of the thickness of the cervix. Sectioning of the posterior corpus demonstrates a homogeneous firm tan-white parenchyma without gross pathologic lesion. Representative sections are submitted. Al, A2.

LEFT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "left ovary and fallopian tube", and received in formalin is an intact fallopian tube and ovary which measure 5.7 cm in length x 0.6 x 0.6 cm, and 3.4 x 2.5 x 1.1 cm, respectively. There is minimal attached ovarian adnexal tissue. The external surface of the ovary demonstrates a tan-white gyrated SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Page 2 of 4

PATIENT: PATH #: surface without gross pathologic lesion. Upon sectioning the ovary demonstrates three cystic lesions and a firm white corpora albicantia and is otherwise free of gross pathologic lesion. These cysts measures 0.3 x 0.3 cm, 0.6 x 0.6 cm, and 0.9 x 0.7 cm. Sectioning of the fallopian tube demonstrates a patent stellate lumen with a maximum dimension of 0.2 cm.

RIGHT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "right ovary and fallopian tube", and received in formalin is an intact. fallopian tube and ovary which measure 6.5 cm in length x 0.6 x 0.6 cm, and 3.1 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm, respectively. The external surface of the ovary demonstrates multiple red-brown discolored. (likely hemorrhagic) cystic structures and a firm white gyrates appearance. Upon sectioning the ovary demonstrates multiple smooth-walled cystic structures  one filled with red-brown viscous material (chocolate cyst) which measures 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The remainder of the cysts are smooth-walled and have a thin translucent fluid within their lumens and which range in size from 0.4 x 0.4 cm to 0.6 x 0.4 cm, 0.7 x 0.7 cm, and 0.I x 0.1 cm.

APPENDIX Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "appendix", and received in formalin is an intact vermiform appendix measures 6.2 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm and which has a moderate amount of attached periappendiceal fat which extends 2.2 cm from the external surface of the specimen. The external surface is tan-pink smooth and glistening without pathologic lesion. Sectioning of the specimen demonstrates a patent stellate Iunen measuring 0.2 cm in maximal dimension. Representative sections are submitted. J1. Proximal, mid and distal appendix - 3 Gross dictated by OPERATIVE CALL OPERATIVE CONSULT (GROSS): GROSS (CX-UX): Cx tumor circumferential extending to endocervix and probably to lower uterine segment Vaginal mucosa and cervix soft tissues grossly free of tumor margin (portion of tumor collected for research) SPECIMEN D (RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE):  Negative for tumor If this reporr includes immunohistochemical test results, please note the following:.
