Preoperative Diagnosis  Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Intraoperative Consultation FSA DISTAL PANCREAS AND SPLEEN: Distal pancreas margin: Negative for tumor. Comment: This frozen section diagnosis/result is communicated to and acknowledged by Dr. AD,have performed the intraoperative consuitation and issued the above diagnosis. Gross Descriptiond  Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section consuitaton, labeled *distal pancreas and spleen" and consists of a 571.3 gram distal pancreas with attached spleen. The pancreas is 14.5 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm. The spleen is 17.0 x 12.0 x 4.7 cm. Within the pancreas is an 8.0 x 4.7 x 3.0 cm.. partially encapsulated, soft tan and orange, lobulated mass. The mass extends the full length of the pancreas and is 0.7 cm from the pancreatic margin. The mass has a surrounding, thin membranous lining, which is inked blue. There is a small amount of normal pancreatic tissue surrounding the mass The remaining pancreas is yellow, lobulated, admixed with thick, white fibrous stroma. The spleen is homogeneous, dark red, and slightly nodular. No mass or other lesions are identified. The pancreatic margin is sectioned tangentially, frazen and entirely submitted in FSA1. Additional representative sectons are submitted as follows: A2: Mass perpendicular to margin.. A3-A4: Mass with adjacent normal pancreas. A5-A6: Mass with surrounding thin membrane.. A7-A8: Mass. A9: Mass with duct A10: Normal pancreas. A11: Normal spleen. A12. 7 possible lymph nodes.. A13. 7 possible lymph nodes. A14: 7 possible lymph nodes, 2 differentially inked and bisected.. A15. 5 possible lymph nodes.. A16: 4 possible lymph nodes, 2 differentially inked and sectioned.. A17-A18: 1 possible lymph node,sectioned A portion of tissue is submitted to Tissue Procurement Laboratory 1/3/14 Primary Tumor Site HIPAA Discrepancy Prior Malignancy Histo Dual/Synchic QUALIFISD DISQUALIFIEO
