Summary of sections: LN - lymph nodes 8. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "bladder, urethra and anterior vaginal wall". it consist of a bladder and anterior vaginal wall with bilatera ureters measuring 13cm from superior to inferior, 10 cm laterally and 4cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder measures 12 x10 x 4 cm. The portion of vaginal cuff measures 2x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. The distal urethra and the vaginal cuff margin are shaved and submitted. The ureteric stumps measure 0.6 cm in lenght and 0.2 cm in diamter. The specimen is inked green on the right side and blue on the left side and the bladder is opened anteriorly to reveal an infiltrating firm lesion 5.5x 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The. Jesion is located in the left postero lateral wall and extends.to.the.dome.region. The distance from the left and the right ureteric. orifices are 0.4 cm and 2.8 cm respectively. On sectioning, the tumor extends to a depth of 3.0cm, and is approaching the. perivesical fat grossly. The remaining bladder mucosa shows edematous mucosa. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are not identified. Tissue is submitted for TPs.  Representative sections are submitted.
