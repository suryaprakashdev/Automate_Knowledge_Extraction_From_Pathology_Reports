Clinical Diagnosis & History: Large right renal mass. Specimens Submitted 1:SPRight kidney and part of right adrenal DIAGNOSIS: 1) KIDNEY AND ADRENAL,RIGHT,NEPHRECTOMY AND PARTIAL ADRENALECTOMY: -RENAL CELL CARCINOMA,CHROMOPHOBE TYPE.THE PATTERN OF GROWTH IS ACINAR AND SOLID.THE TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER IS 10.9CM. THE TUMOR IS CONFINED WITHIN THE RENAL CAPSULE. THE TUMOR EXTENDS INTO THE RENAL PELVIS AND INVADES THE RENAL VEIN WITH TUMOR THROMBOEMBOLUS.ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY IS UNREMARKABLE.THE ADRENAL GLAND SHOWS CORTICAL NODULAR HYPERPLASIA. THE COLLOIDAL IRON STAIN IS NON-CONTRIBUTORY. IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASEDUPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL).AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWEDAND APPROVED THIS REPORT Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right kidney and part of right adrenal". It consists of nephrectomy specimen including kidney, attached perinephric fatty tissue and portion of adrenal, measuring 16.5 x 11.8 x 6.6 cm overall and weighing 770 grams. The attached portion of adrenal measures 5 x0.8 x 0.5 cm. Also attached to the kidney is a segment of ureter, measuring 7.5 cm in length by 0.4 cm in diameter.Present at the middle portion slightly towards to the upper pole and on the lateral aspect is a bosselated, slightly lobulated tumor mass, measuring 10.9x 9.9 x 5.4 cm. On cut surface, the mass shows purple-pink-tan lobulated, soft periphery with foci of hemorrhagic necrosis and a central fibrosis. The mass which Page 1 of2

SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT involves renal cortex and medulla, is grossly impinging on the pelvis. The renal capsule grossly is not involved by tumor. Examination of the hilar vessels reveal the vascular lumen to be filled by tumor thrombus. The ureteral mucosa grossly is pink- tan and smooth. The uninvolved renal parenchyma is purple-white without additional lesion. Within the hilar area and perinephric fatty tissue, no lymph nodes are identified. Sectioning of adrenal shows yellow-golden granular nodule,1.0 x0.8 x 0.5 cm. Portion of the specimen is submitted for Tps.
