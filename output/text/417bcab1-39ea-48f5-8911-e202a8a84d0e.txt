Gross Description: Received are twenty specimen containers all labeled with the patient's name Parts D through part R are all received fresh for frozen section evaluation with parts A through C, S and T received in formalin. Part A is received additionally labeled "right level 1B and level 1A" and consists of a single portion of pink-tan to yellow soft tissue consisting of an apparent salivary gland, which is 4 x 3.2 x 1.3 cm with an additional attached fibrofatty tissue, which are 3 x 2 x 1.1 cm. Step sectioning the salivary gland component reveals the usual tan lobulated architecture without distinct mass. There are no intraparenchymal lymph nodes grossly identified. Representative section of the salivary gland is submitted in cassette A1. Within the associated fibrofatty tissues there are four probable lymph nodes, which range from 0.2 to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension, none of which appear involved by

tumor, which are submitted as follows: A2  one whole probable lymph node; A3  three whole probable lymph nodes. Part B is received additionally labeled "rightperifacial lymph node" and consists of a single portion of pink-tan nodular and yellow lobulated soft tissue, all of which have aggregate dimensions of 2 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm. Examination of these tissues confirms the presence of two probable lymph nodes, 0.3 and 1.8 cm in greatest dimension, neither of which appear to have tumor involvement. These lymph node candidates are submitted as follows: B1  one whole probable lymph node; B2  one whole probable lymph node bisected. Part C is received additionally labeled "right mandible composite resection (margins taken from patient), single stitch margin right basilar tongue, double stitch right anterior buccal." This composite specimen has aggregate dimensions of 9 x 6 x 5 cm and consists of a partial resection of mandible, having dimensions of 6 x 4.5 x 0.9 cm with associated adherent soft tissue, surfaced by mucosa to include right buccal wall region of trigone, floor of mouth and approaching base of tongue. This soft tissue component has dimensions of 9 x 4.5 by up to 2 cm (base of tongue). The cut surfaces of the soft tissue component are inked in the following manner: Base of tongue black (region of single suture), perimandibular tissues and region approaching trigone pharyngeal wall blue. The mucosa of the specimen is remarkable for an area of probable leukoplakia 3.5 x 2 cm with areas that are slightly raised up to 0.2 cm, superior/pharyngeal trigone region with an abutting separate nodular mass, which is 1.4 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm, grossly consistent with possible fibroma. Subjacent to the area of fibroma and leukoplakia, there is a separate confluent area of presumed invasive tumor, 5.5 x 3.2 cm, which extends from the angle of the mandible/right buccal wall (area of double tailed suture) confluent to the base of tongue region (see gross photo). The area of leukoplakia approaches the posterior cut surface to within 0.4 cm, probable invasive mass approaches anterior cut surface of soft tissue/mandible to within 0.5 cm and posteriorly 0.6 cm, as well as base of tongue to within 0.4 cm. The soft tissues are removed from the bony mandible component and there is gross evidence of tumor adherent to the surface of the bone at the angle of the mandible and subsequent sectioning through this area of adherent tumor reveals superficial involvement of cortical bone with no gross evidence of deep invasion, to be confirmed microscopically (cassettes C4 and C5). Sectioning through the region previously described as probable leukoplakia, confirms superficial involvement of the mucosa and sectioning through the abutting adjacent possible fibroma confirms its tan-white homogeneous cut surface without hemorrhage or necrosis. Sectioning through the primary mass reveals verrucoid change, as well as grossly invasive tumor to a depth of 0.7 cm, which correlates with the region previously abutting the mandible (see cassettes C9-11). Step sectioning through the confluent tumor, which approaches base of tongue, reveals invasion to a depth of 0.4 cm and

approaches to within 0.7 cm of the deep cut surface base of tongue (see cassette. C12 and C13). Sections are submitted as follows:. C1  anterior mandible margin of surgical resection following decalcification; C2  posterior mandible bony margin of resection following decalcification; C3  superior pole mandible following decalcification; C4-5  sections of mandible with adherent tumor following decalcification; C6 area of leukoplakia;.

Microscopic Description: Histologic examination reveals a right mandibular composite resection with right neck dissection. The composite resection is prominent for a mucosal squamous cell carcinoma demonstrating a papillary surface configuration with extensive keratinization. Invasion into the underlying connective tissue is seen in the form of sheets and islands. Moderate differentiation is noted in areas. This arises from an extensive zone of carcinoma in situ and dysplasia across the surface of the specimen. The carcinoma focally erodes the cortex of the mandible but does not invade the medullary component. The associated lymph node dissection fails to reveal the presence of metastatic disease.
