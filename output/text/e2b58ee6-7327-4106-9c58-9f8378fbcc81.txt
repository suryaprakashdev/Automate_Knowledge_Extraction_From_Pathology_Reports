TCGA # Internal Sample ID Diagnosis: The material in I is a partial resection of small intestine with reactive lesions, The material in II is a preparation of the rectosigmoid colon (in clinical terms attributable to the rectum or the sigmoid colon) with a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the area of the rectosigmoid junction (G3), with infiltration of blood and lymph vessels (L1, V1) and a lymph node metastasis (pN1). Locally, the lesion was completely removed.. The distance from the mesorectal fascia was at least I cm.. The overall clinical findings and the topography should serve to determine whether this is a rectal carcinoma in the narrower sense of the term or a carcinoma of the sigmoid colon.
