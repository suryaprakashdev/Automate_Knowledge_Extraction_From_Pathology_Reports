Sentinel node #1 right axilla, hot and blue, count of 300 B.  Sentinel node #2 palpable right axilla, not hot and not blue. C. Sentinel node #3, hot and blue, count of 70 right axilla. D. Segmental mastectomy right breast, single long lateral, double long anterior. E. Tissue medial to segmental mastectomy right breast. Stitch is new medial right margin. CLINICAL NOTES PRE-op DiAgnosIs: Right breast cancer, clinical stage 2A carcinoma. of right breast. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS A. Two lymph nodes negative for metastatic disease.. B. Single lymph node negative for metastatic disease. C. Single lymph node negative for metastatic disease.. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Part A is received fresh for frozen section labeled "sentinel node #2 right axilla". It consists of a portion of lymph node-bearing hemorrhagic adipose tissue measuring 2 x 1.7. 0.5 cm. Within the fat two lymph nodes are present. The smaller measures 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. On section it is dark blue and soft. The larger node measures 1.3 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. On section it is mostly fatty with an area of dark blue discoloration. Each node is entirely submitted in one block for frozen section. B. Received fresh for frozen section labelled "sentinal node #2 palpable right axilla." It consists of a single discrete pink-tan nodule measuring 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. On section it is homogenous soft and tan. It is bisected and all submitted in. one block for frozen section. C. Received fresh for frozen section labelled "sentinel node #3 right axilla." It consists of a single pink-blue nodule measuring 0.3 cm in diameter all submitted for frozen section 3

GROSS DESCRIPTION in one block. D. Received fresh for tissue procurement as "segmental mastectomy right breast." It consists of a portion of fibroadipose tissue measuring 6.2 x 5.5 x 3.8 cm. Sutures are present for orientation. The superior margin is painted orange,. inferior margin yellow, anterior margin green, lateral margin blue, medial margin red and posterior margin black. On the surface of the anteroinferior portion there is a possible piece of skin measuring. 1 x 0.6 cm. The surface of this possible skin fragment is painted red. On sectioning, the specimen, centrally, there is a biopsy cavity containing amorphous hemorrhagic debris and at least 1 rice-like foreign object. Surrounding this 1 cm cavity is an area of firm dull tan induration consistent with tumor. This tumor does not grossly approximately margins and comes apparently closest to the posterior margin. A portion of this tumor is taken for tissue procurement. The tumor measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted following fixation. BLOcK summARy: D1-D2 - orange end of the specimen, D3-D4 - yellow end of the specimen, D5-d20 - biopsy cavity with adjacent margins. RS-20. E. The specimen is received unfixed labelled "tissue medial to segmental mastectomy right breast." It consists of a portion of fibroadipose tissue measuring 4.5 x 1.7 x 1 cm. A suture is present on one surface. The surface with the suture is painted orange as the opposite suface is painted black. The tissue is grossly unremarkable. As-1. BLOck suMMARy: Tissue submitted from one end to the other and submitted in cassettes E1-E5. As-5.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Invasive carcinoma: Histologic type: Ductal Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated Overall grade: 2 Architectural score: 2-3 Nuclear score: 2-3 Mitotic score: 1 Greatest dimension (pT): 2.5 cm, pT2 Specimen margins: Invasive carcinoma extends to 2 mm from the anterior margin of excision. Vessel invasion: Not identified Calcification: Multifocal calcifications are identified within the invasive carcinoma. Ductal carcinoma in situ: Histologic pattern: Cribriform Nuclear grade: 2 Central necrosis: J Focally present % Dcis of total tumor (if mixed): Less than 25% Extensive intraductal component (present/absent): Present Specimen margins: Ductal carcinoma in situ is present 0.5 mm from the anterior margin of excision. Calcification: Present Description of non-tumorous breast: Fibrocystic changes with mild to florid ductal hyperplasia and microcalcifications identified associated with benign breast epithelium. Skin with central ulceration, inflammation and reactive changes. Comments: The sentinel lymph nodes are serially sectioned and stain with keratin immunohistochemistry. Within the invasive carcinoma focal perineural invasion by tumor is identified. A p63 stain is performed on several blocks to evaluate DcIs.
