lumpectomy and right axillary sentinel node dissection. Most recent breast imaging on showed in the right breast at the 10 o'clock position an. irregularly shaped heterogenous enhancing mass with irregular margins and metallic clip artifact at mid depth measuring 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm representing. the biopsy proven malignant lesion.Posterior to that main mass was a focal. non-mass like enhancement measuring 1.6 x 1.1 cm suspicious for extension of the disease with a total extent of 2.8 cm. Comment Part E: The tumor reveals a mixed ductal and lobular morphologic appearance,. however, immunohistochemical stains for E-cadherin were performed on representative areas and supports the presence of a lobular carcinoma.. Case presented at multidisciplinary breast conference on. Specimens Received: A: Right axillary sentinel node#1 B: Right axillary sentinel node #2

C: Right axillary sentinel node #3 D: Right axillary sentinel node #4 E: Right breast partial mastectomy F: Additional superior medial margin Gross Description: The specimen is received in six containers each labeled with the patient' s name and medical record number. A.Container A is further designated as'1. Right axillary sentinel node #1. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm firm, rubbery Iymph node that is dissected and entirely submitted in cassette A1. B. Container B is further designated as '2. Right axillary sentinel node #2.' Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm tan, rubbery lymph node candidate that is entirely submitted in cassette B1. C. Container C is further designated as '3. Right axillary sentinel node #3.' Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm tan, rubbery lymph node candidate. It is entirely submitted in cassette C1 D. Container D is further designated as '4. Right axillary sentinel node #4. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm tan, rubbery lymph

node candidate that is entirely submitted in cassette D1 E. Container E is further designated as'5. Right breast partial mastectomy with the paper work additionally designating 1 stitch = lateral. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 99.5 gram, 8.5 cm (superior to inferior) x 10.0 cm (medial to lateral) x 3.5 cm (anterior to posterior) breast lumpectomy specimen on a radiographic grid with a corresponding x-ray film. There is a metallic clip located in the center of a spiculated irregularly shaped mass which corresponds to C3-C4, D3-D4 and D5. The metallic clip is located in D4. There is a questionable extension of the mass into grids E3-E4. A wire extends through the center of this mass entering at B5 and terminating at F1. The specimen is received with two sutures, long designating lateral and short designating superior. The margins are inked as follows: superior blue, inferior green, anterior black, posterior red, lateral violet and medial yellow.The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 14 slices to reveal a 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm firm, white poorly circumscribed mass extending from slice 6 to slice 9.There is a metallic clip found on the center of this mass in slice 8.The mass approaches the anterior margin within O.3 cm (slice 9) and the posterior margin within 0.6 cm (slice 7).Additionally, the lesion is 3.5 cm from the inferior margin and O.7 cm from the superior margin. The mass is greater than 2 cm from both the medial and lateral margins. The wire terminates in slice 11. The remainder of the breast tissue consists of grossly unremarkable yellow, lobulated adipose tissue. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

E2-E3: anterior margin from slice 8 E4-E5: mass in slice 7 showing closest approach to posterior margin E6-E7: mass in slice 6 demonstrating biopsy site changes E8: inferior margin from slice 6 E9-E10: mass in slice 10 showing nearest approach to anterior margin E11: posterior margin slice 7 E12-E13: posterior inferior margin slice 8 E14: posterior margin slice 9 E15: anterior margin slice 9 E16: anterior margin slice 8 E17: anterior superior margin slice 6 E18-E20: sections immediately lateral to mass (slice 5) E21-E22: sections immediately medial to mass (slice 10) E23: grossly unremarkable breast parenchyma slice 3 E24: grossly unremarkable breast parenchyma slice 12 E25: lateral margin serially sectioned (slice 1) E26: medial margin serially sectioned (slice 14) F.Container F is further designated as '3. Additionalsuperior medial margin,. short stitch marks new true margin.' Received fresh is a 38.0 gram portion of. yellow, lobulated fibroadipose tissue that measures 8.5 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm. The. short stitch designates the new true margin. This aspect is inked blue. The. specimen does not have any further orientation. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal that is primarily composed of yellow, lobulated adipose

tissue with a region of enhanced firm, white fibrosis measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm that appears to abut the new true margin. The specimen is entirely submitted sequentially in cassettes F1-F23 with the fibrotic region in F9-F14. Pathologist Sign Out:
