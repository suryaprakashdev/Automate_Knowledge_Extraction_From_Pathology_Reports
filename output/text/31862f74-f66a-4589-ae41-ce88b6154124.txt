PRE-OPERATIVE DiAGNOSIS: Bladder CA POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A-D: See final microscopic-diagnosis.. E: Sections of the bladder show multiple extensive areas of high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma, penetrating into perivesical fat but sparing adjacent organs. (uterus and cervix). Extensive multifocal lymphovascular space invasion is. present. Also present are several foci of the deceptively bland trabecular pattern. superficially invading the lamina propria.. Sections of the cervix show cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin III) with gland duct involvement. No invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma is. identified. Architecturally while the urethra is involved with urothelial. carcinoma. the ectocervix and cervical stroma are not, thus the two processes are physically discontinuous.

HISTORY ADDENDUM REPORT * Final Report * Document Type: *Date - Date of Service: Document Status: Document Title: Encounter info: Contributor System: Final Rer DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma-in-situ with pagetoid spread was noted in the patient' s biadder, urethra, and also in the cervical specimen. In order to determine the origin of these processes, and whether or not they were related or separate,  we performed immunohistochemical studies on the bladder tumor (slide E7), the cervix (slide E17), and the urethra (slide S2). The studies demonstrate the following: E7 E17  S2  Bladder Cervix Urethra CK7 ++ ++ ++ +/- squamous mucosa CK20 + - squamous mucosa CPV High background High background High background These results indicate that the carcinoma in situ process is related, and of transitional cell origin. Thus, the transitional cell carcinoma is extending by pagetoid spread widely throughout the anterior exenteration specimen. 88342 x 9 Signature Line Signed by: ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE Completed Action List: Printed by: Page 1 of 1 Printed on: (End of Report)
