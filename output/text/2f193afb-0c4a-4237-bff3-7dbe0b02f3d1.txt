No clinical history is given.. PRE-OP DIAGNOsIS: Right kidney mass. POST-OP DIagNOSIS: Same. DEDURE: Right nephrectomy. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Kidney, right, nephrectomy --  RENAl CELL CArcINOmA, COnVenTIONAL (CLEAR) CELl TypE FUHRMAN' S NUCLEAR GRADE IS 2 OF 4 C.  The greatest diameter of the neoplAsm is 4 cm.. D. THE NEOPLASM IS CONFINED WITHIN THE RENAL CAPSULE E.  NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED F. NO eVIDeNCE OF ANGgIOLympHATIC inVASION IS IdenTIfIeD. G. ALL SURGICAL MArGINS ARE FrEE OF THe NEOPLASM H. THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY IS UNREMARKABLE I. THE ADRENAL GLAND IS UNREMARKABLE J. TNM STAGE: pT1a Nx MX. K. Tnm histologic grade - G2.s COMMENT: A panel of immunohistochemical stains has been performed, which showed the tumor cells to be strongly positive tor CD10, and weakly positive for RcC and E-cadherin. Tumor cells are focally positive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for Ber- EP4. A colloidal iron stain was also negative. This staining pattern supports a diagnosis of conventional type renal cell carcinoma. Case synopsis: SYNOPTIC DATA - PRIMARY KIDNEy TUMORS SPECIMEN TYPE:  Radical nephrectomy LATERALITY: Right TumOr site: Middle FOCALITY: Unifocal TUMOR SIZE: Greatest dimension: 4.0 cm Additional dimensions: 3.5 cm MACrOScOpIC eXTeNt Of TUmOR:  Tumor limited to kidney HISTOLOGIC TyPE: Clear cell (conventional) renal carcinoma HISTOLOGIC GRADE (Fuhrman Nuclear Grade): G2 PATHOLOGIC STAGING (pTNM): pT1a pNX Number of regional lymph nodes examined: 0 pMX MARGINS: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma ADRENAl GLAND: Uninvolved by tumor VEnoUs (LArge VEsseL) invasion (V): Absent LymphaTIC (SmaLL VESseL) inVasiOn (L): Absent ADDITIONAL PAThOLOGIC FINDINGS: Glomerular disease (type): Minimal global glomerusclerosis.
