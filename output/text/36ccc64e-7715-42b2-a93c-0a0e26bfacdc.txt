RUN DATE RUN TIME: PAGE 3 Specimen Inquiry. RUN USER: SPEC #: PATIENT: (Continued) GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is submitted in five containers A. The first specimen submitted in the fresh state is labeled "right breast tissue". The specimen is the right brsast. total mastectomy specimen. Suture marks the axillary tail of. the breast. There is an ellipsa of white skin containing the nipple. This measures 9 x 4.5 cm. The breast itself measures 23 x 22.5 x 6.5 cm. the surface at approximately the 11 o'clock position. The overlying superficial margin  There is a firm mass palpable beneath adjacent to ths skin is marked with black ink and the deep margin beneath this is marked with blue ink. On cut section the mass measures approximately 4.5 x 3 x 3 cm. The edges are quite difficult to discern and are more easily palpated than visualized.. of the specimen there is a small focus of hemorrhage consistent with previous biopsy. A . In the center portion of this mass is set aside for tissue banking per protocol. The mass extends to within approximately l cm of the overlying superficial margin at approximately 11 o'clock at its closest point. It is located well above the daop margin which is approximately 7 cm beneath the mass. Cut sections through the remainder of the breast tissue reveals some rubbery white parenchymal breast tissue and abundant yellow fat. There are no other. nodules or mass is identified. Sections are submitted as follows:. A1 nipple A2-5 -  mass in breast. A6  mass in breast with adjacent tissue A7-9 -  non-neoplastic appearing breast tissue B. The second specimen is received in the fresh state in the operating room and represents two axillary lymph nodes. one measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm and the other measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm. The cut sections are hard. A section of each is examined by frozen section. These are submitted in block B1. frozen section control. Additional section of each is submitted in block B2. C. The third specimen initially in the fresh state is labeled "sentinel node #1" and is a piece of yellow fat measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm with a 1 cm round moderately firm lymph node which is bisected and submitted in toto in block cl. D. The fourth specimen is labeled "level 3 axillary nodes". The specimen is a piece of yellow fatty tissue measuring 9 x 3 x 1.5 cm with a suture marking the highest level 3 lymph node. There are five additional small lymph nodes. block D1 and the other five lymph nodes are submitted in block D2.. The highest node is submitted in E. tissue measuring 10 x 9 x 2.5 cm. Within the fatty tissue are several nodules consistent with lymph nodes.  The largest of these measures 2 cm in diameter and on cut section is. partially replaced by very hard white tissue. A section of each node is submitted in blocks Ei through E4. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The slides are examined and evaluated. ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **
