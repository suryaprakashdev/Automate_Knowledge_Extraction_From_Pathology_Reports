Negative for carcinoma (Dr. ). c. Mostly denuded epithelium, negative for carcinoma (Dr. D. Negative for carcinoma, however, no epithelium identified (Dr. F. Negative for carcinoma (Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh labeled "right colon" is a 14.5 cm segment of right colon with an attached 9 cm segment of terminal ileum. An appendix is identified. The serosal surface is smooth and glistening. The wall of the colon averages 0.3 cm in thickness. The wall of the terminal ileum averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa of the colon demonstrates a brown-yellow submucosal nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.3 cm located 5.4 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning reveals a yellow homogenous cut surface. It does not invade the underlying wall. Multiple soft white polyps are identified ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.4 cm. All appear superficial. In the ascending colon, there is an irregular red slightly depressed area resembling a possible biopsy site measuring 0.8 x 0.2 cm located 14 cm from the distal margin. It is superficial and does not invade into the underlying wall. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. No firm mass lesions are identified. The mucosa of the terminal ileum is unremarkable. The attached appendix measures 4.7 cm in length and 0.9 cm in diameter. The lumen is dilated to 0.2 cm and contains fecal material. No perforations or ulcerations are seen. Sectioning through the surrounding fibroadipose tissue reveals multiple ovoid tan firm nodules resembling lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al margins (proximal margin blue, distal margin orange). A2-A3 submucosal nodule totally submitted, A3 biopsy site totally submitted, A4-A5 polyps totally submitted, A6 appendix, A7 ileocecal valve, A8 small bowel, A9-A17 lymph nodes. B. Received fresh at the frozen desk labeled #right distal ureter" is a 0.3 cm in diameter, 0.2 cm in length luminal tan-pink soft tissue fragment. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen section in one cassette labeled B1. Page 3 of 5

Encounter Date: C. Received fresh at the frozen desk labeled "left distal ureter" is a 0.3 cm in diameter, 0.2 cm in length tan-pink luminal soft tissue fragment. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen section in one cassette labeled C1. D. Received fresh at the frozen desk labeled "urethral margin" is a 2 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm red-tan mucosal lined soft tissue fragment. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen section in one cassette labeled D1.. E. Received in formalin is a specimen consisting of a urinary bladder, bilateral ureters, uterus, attached cervix, and portion of vagina. The bladder measures 6.0 x 4.5 x 4.2 cm. The external surface of the bladder is covered by a smooth serosal lining at the dome and fibroadipose tissue at the remaining portion. After the bladder is opened, a tan fungating mass is identified in the right anterior bladder wall extending to the left and right trigone region measuring 5.0 x 3.1 x 1.2 cm. Upon multiple cross sections there does appear to be gross extension beyond the bladder wall extending to within 0.2 cm of the soft tissue margin. Also, identified on the left bladder wall is an ulcerated indurated area of mucosa measuring 4.2 x 3.0 cm. This area of this bladder wall extends posteriorly and is associated with a thickened bladder wall measuring up to 2.0 cm. The bladder wall grossly appears to be involved by a mass which extends beyond the bladder wall, approaching the soft tissue margin. The right ureter measures 5.0 cm and is unremarkable. The left ureter measures 6.0 cm and is also unremarkable. The uterus measures 6.0 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm, and weighs 53.2 grams. A section of vaginal cuff and vagina are present measuring 5.0 x 1.2 cm. The vaginal mucosa is unremarkable. The ectocervix is unremarkable. The endocervical canal measures 1.8 cm in length. Polyps are not present. The endometrial canal measures 4.2 cm in length and 2.0 cm in greatest width. The endometrium measures 0.1 cm in thickness and has a tan, smooth and glistening appearance. The myometrium measures 1.5 cm in thickness and is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows: E1 - additional section right ureter, E2 additional section left ureter, E3 posterior bladder wall with right ureter orifice and small portion of possible mass, E4-e7 right bladder wall with mass with extension beyond bladder wall with soft tissue margin, E8 anterior bladder wall, E9 left bladder wall with mass near ureter, E10-E12 left bladder wall with mass and soft tissue margin, E13 left trigone region with mass, B14 left trigone region with mass and portion of vaginal mucosa, E15 right trigone region with mass, E16 anterior bladder wall, E17-E18 posterior bladder wall with mass, E19-e20 anterior cervix, E21 posterior cervix, E22 anterior uterine. wall, E23 posterior uterine wall.. -. ! F. Received fresh at the frozen desk labeled "urethral margin #2" are two fragments of red-pink soft tissue measuring 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The. specimen is totally submitted for frozen section in one cassette labeled F1. G. Received in formalin labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple yellow-tan segments of nodular adipose tissue aggregating to 5.8 x 4.3 x 1.7 cm. Palpation reveals three tan, firm nodules resembling lymph nodes ranging in size from 1.2 to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. Additionally a fragmented matted segment of nodular tissue is present measuring 4.4 x 4.0 Page 4 of 5
