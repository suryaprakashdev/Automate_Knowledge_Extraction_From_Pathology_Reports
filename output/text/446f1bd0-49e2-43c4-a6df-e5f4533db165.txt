C64.9 Synoptic Report: Laterality: Right. OpJ 8/19113 Specimen Procedure: Partial nephrectomy. Tumor Site: Upper pole. Tumor Size: 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm. Tumor Focality: Unifocal. Macroscopic Extent of Tumor: See Comment. Histologic Type: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type I. Sarcomatoid Features: Not identified. Tumor Necrosis: Not identified. Histologic Grade (Fuhrman Nuclear Grade): Grade 2.. Microscopic Extent of Tumor: See Comment. Lymphvascular Invaslon: Not identified. Margins: Parenchymal: Negative. Soft Tissue: Negative. Regional lymph nodes: Cannot be assessed, pNX. Pathologic Staging: pT1b NX MX (see Comment). Pathologic Findings in Non-Neoplastic Kidney: None identified.. Comments: The capsule overlying the tumor was disrupted prior to receipt of the specimen, with tumor contents spilling out of the superior pole. However, sections of the adjacent perinephric fat show no definitive invasion, fibrosis or inflammation. Therefore, we favor that the neoplasm was confined to the kidney prior to surgery and is therefore staged pT1b. This case has been reviewed and the diagnosis approved by consulting departmental surgical pathoiogy staff.

Patient Resultsd M Clinical History: Right renal mass. (A) Tumor Board. Intraoperative Consultation:. Time Recelved: Time Reported: FSA1-FSA4: Right partial nephrectomy: Renal resection margin free of tumor. Gross Description:. (A) (right partial nephrectomy -FS). Specimen components and dimensions: Received fresh for intraoperative consultation are 43.0 gm, 6.5 x 6.0 x up to 0.3 cm portion of resected kidney, attached perinephric fat with extruding soft brown friable material; and several fragments of red-yellow adipose tissue, weighing 440 gm, and measuring 20.0 x 14.0 x 5.0 cm in aggregate dimensions. The parenchymal margin on the resection specimen grossly appears free of tumor. The parenchymal margin is submitted en face for frozen section evaluation as FSA1-FSA4. Size, appearance and locatlon of tumor: The lesion erodes into/extrudes out from the pole of the resection specimen, and measures 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm. It is thinly encapsulated adjacent to the adjacent renal parenchyma and consists largely of red-brown friable tissue and debris. The superior aspect merges with the perinephric fat, and is not encapsulated or surrounded by fat.  Renal capsule/Renal sinus: The minimal amount of capsule over the parenchymal resection margin appears grossly free of tumor. Renal sinus is not present. Renal vein: Vascular margins were not submitted Other findings: The perinephric fat is unlformly soft, red-yellow, and grossly free of tumor. There is an 8.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm segment of spongy friable red-brown material, consistent with the lesional tissue.d Uninvolved tissues: The adjacent grossly normal renal. parenchyma is red brown and unremarkable. The extra renal fat is soft, red to yellow and without lesion.. Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes were not submitted. Blocks submitted: A5-A7 - full thickness cross section of leslon extending into perlrenal fat A8-A9 - normal parenchyma adjacent on either side of lesion A10 - representative section of additional lesional tissue A11-A12 - representative sections of perinephric fat (B) (perinephric fat right side) Received in formalin is 110 gm, 16.0 x 15.0 x 1.5 cm segment of yellow-red fibroadipose Printed from: Page: 2 of 4

Patient Results m tissue. Serial sectioning through the specimen reveals a uniform soft yellow cut surface. Representative sections are submitted in B1-B2. Microscopic Description: Complete microscopic evaluation has been performed. Appropriately reacting controls have been performed and evaluated for all stains on this case as required.. Histopathology has a list of IH antibodies that are regulated as analyte specific reagents (ASR's). These assays were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the They have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary for the ASR's. These tests are not investigational  and are used in standard clinical care. In cases where Immunohistochemistry testing is performed, the following antibodies and their respective clones may be used to determine Her2neu(4B5), CD117(Poly). CD20(L26) Ki67(30-9). Unless otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for ERPR by IHC, Her2 by IHC and/or HER2 by FiSH have been fixed as per C.A.P. requirements for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 48 hours. ER, PR, Ki-67, p53 are reported as a semi-quantitative percentage of positively stained nuclei. Her-2/neu and EGFR are scored as follows: No staining at ail is scored as (0), weak,  incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is scored as (1+), less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells or complete strong staining in less than 30% of cells is scored as (2+), and strong complete staining in more that 30% of cells is scored as (3+). All studies are performed on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalln and embedded in paraffin unless otherwise stated in the report.. Printed from: Page: 3 of 4
