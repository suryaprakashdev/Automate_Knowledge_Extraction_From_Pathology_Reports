Accession Number: Report Status: Amend/Addenda Type: Surgical Pathology Specimen Type: Kidney, partial or total resection Procedure Date: Ordering Provide TCGA-CZ-5452 PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: A. SPECIMEN LABELED "RIGHT KIDNEY": RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear cell type (14.0 cm), Fuhrman grade II of IV. No extrarenal extension identified. No lymphovascular invasion identified. Ureteral, renal vein, and renal artery margins negative for tumor. AJcc classification (6th Edition): T2 NO MX. The non-neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the. findings will be reported in an addendum. B. SPECIMEN LABELED "REGIONAL LYMPH NODE": Five (5) lymph nodes negative for tumor. CLINICAL DATA History: old male with right varicocele. cT revealed large right renal. mass. Operation: Nephrectomy. Operative Findings: None given.. Clinical Diagnosis: None given.. TISSUE SUBMITTED: #1. Right kidney #2. Regional lymph node. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in two parts, each labeled with the patients name and unit number. Part A, labeled "right kidney", and consists of a 1,360 gram kidney (23.0 x 12. x 8.2 cm), with ureter (11.5 cm in length x 0.3 cm), renal vein (1.3 cm in length x 0.7 cm), and renal artery (2.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter). The soft tissue resection margin is inked black and the kidney is bisected to. reveal a multilobulated mass in the mid to lower pole (14.0 x 11.2 x 6.1 cm). The mass is predominantly tan/yellow with multiple hemorrhaqic foci. The tumor is less than 0.1 cm from the inked resection, 10.6 cm from the ureteral margin,. 1.8 cm from the renal vein margin, and 4 cm from the renal artery margin. The tumor grossly appears to abut the perirenal adipose tissue. The tumor grossly extends to but does not involve the renal pelvis. The remainder of the renal parenchyma demonstrates well-demarcated cortical medullary junctions and is electron microscopy, cytogenetic analysis, and tissue banking. A representative section of normal cortex is submitted for electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and tissue banking. The specimen is photographed.. Representative sections are submitted. MIcRo Al: Ureter, rena vein, renal artery resection margin, 3 frags, MICRO A2: T1, 1 frag, MICRO A3: T2, 1 frag, MICRO A4: T3, 1 frag, MIcRo A5-A6: Tumor with soft tissue resection margin, 2 frags. MIcRo A7-A8: Tumor extending into perirenal fat frags, MIcRo A9: Tumor abutting renal pelvis,1 frag, MIcRo A10: Tumor with adjacent .and uninvolved rena parenchyma, 1 frag, MIcRo A11: Uninvolved renal parenchyma, 1 frag, Part B, labeled "regional lymph nodes", and consists of one fragment of adipose.

Clonal aberrations that included loss of the short arm of chromosome 3 (-3) were demonstrated in each of 5 cells from one specimen, and were also seen in 1 of 5 metaphase cells from the second specimen. Loss of chromosome 3 is a typical finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. COMMENTS : Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the. standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a ievel of 400 bands or greater. INDICATION FOR TEST: RCC
