Surgical Pathology Working Draft 2. Microcalcifications associated with benign breast tissue. F. Right breast, new posterior margin, excision: Benign breast tissue, no carcinoma. identified Note: Immunohistochemical studies were necessary to evaluate this case and establish the correct diagnosis. The following immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated:. Keratin cocktail:Patchy positive. CD56: Positive. PAX-5: Positive. LCA: Negative. Chromogranin: negative. Synaptophysin: negative. E-Cadherin: negative. The negative staining with LCA rules against a lymphoid neoplasm. Negative E-Cadherin excludes a ductal carcinoma. The positive staining with PAX-5, CD56 and patchy cytokeratin staining as well as the morphology onH& E stain are compatible with a neuroendocrine carcinoma. Negative staining with chromogranin and synaptophysin, although expected in this entity, does not exclude it.. Breast Tumor Synoptic Comment - Laterallty: Right. - Invasive tumor type: Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, high grade. - Invasive tumor size: 3.8 cm maximum diameter. - Invasive tumor grade (modified Bloom-Richardson): 3. Nuclear grade: 3 points. Mitotic count: 2 points. Tubule/papilla formation: 3 points. Total points and overall grade = 8 points- Grade 3. - Lymphatic-vascular invasion: Absent. - Resection margins for invasive tumor:. - Deep margin: Positive; (slide E12).. - Medial margin: Negative; (tumor is >1 cm away). - Lateral margin: Negative; (tumor is >1 cm away). - Anterior/superior margin: Close; (tumor is less than O.1 cm away, on slide E7) - Anterior/inferior margin: Negative; (tumor is 0.25 cm away, on slide E15). - Lymph node status: - Number of positive lymph nodes: 0. - Total number sampled: 4. - AJCc/UicC stage: pT2n0mX. An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed on block E9. The test for estrogen receptors is negative. There is no nuclear staining in any of tumor cells. Internal positive contro! is present.. The test for progesterone receptors is negative. There is no nuclear staining in any of tumor cells. Internal positive control is present.. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 0 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted Page 2 of 6

Surgical Pathology : Working Draft by Dr. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of O or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FisH testing. The results of the FIsH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of Immunohistochemical and FIsh testing, and almost always show gene amplification.

(Dr. Clinical History The patient is a -year-old woman with post-operative diagnosis of breast cancer, who undergoes. sentinel lymph node biopsy and right partial mastectomy. Gross Description The specimen is received fresh in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. sists of one soft tan-yellow fatty. Part A, additionally labeled " tissue fragment measuring 2.5 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is trimmed, and one candidate lymph node is found. The lymph node is bisected. Touch preps and smear preps are made. The node is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1 and subsequently submitted in cassette A1. The remaining yellow fatty tissue is submitted in cassette A2.  nsists of one soft tan-yellow fatty Part B, additionally labeled ". tissue fragment measuring 2.5 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is trimmed, and one large lymph node is found. The lymph node is bisected. Touch preps and smears are made. The node is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in cassette B1. The remaining yellow fatty tissue is submitted in cassette B2. ," consists of one Part C, additionally labeled ". firm, unoriented, off-white/tan and yellow tissue fragment measuring 2.3 x 2 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is bisected at the long axis and one-half is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 3, and subsequently submitted in cassette C1. The remaining half is submitted in cassette C2.. nsists of one soft and firm pink-red Part D, additionally labeled ". unoriented tissue fragment measuring 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is bisected and touch preps and smears are made. The bisected node is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 4, and. subsequently submitted in cassette D1. onsists of an orlented, roughly ovoid Part E, additlonally labeied fragment of fibrofatty breast tissue containing a tirm palpable mass. The specimen is oriented with two surgical sutures, per the requisition sheet. The short suture is superior and the long suture is Iateral. Oriented as such, the specimen measures 5.7 cm from superlor to inferior, 6 cm from medial to lateral, and 3.6 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked for microscopic evaluation, with the anterior superior surface inked in blue, the anterior inferior surface inked in green, and the posterior surface inked in black. The specimen has been previously incised, prior to receipt in Pathology, and the sections removed from the aforementioned central mass. The specimen is serially Paor 3 nf6

Surgical Pathology - Working Draft sectioned in the sagittal plane into fifteen slices and numbered 1-15, medial to lateral. The medial slice (slice 1) is 0.9 cm in thickness. The lateral slice (slice 15) is 0.9 cm in thickness. The remainder of the slices averages 0.4 cm in thickness. Serial sectioning reveals a firm, tan-white, nodular lesion, which spans serial slices 2-14. This multilobulated mass measures 3.8 cm from superior to inferior, 3 cm from anterior to posterior, measured in slice 7. The mass grossly approaches the posterior margin in slices 6-8. The mass is 0.2 cm from the anterior superior margin in slice 4 and 0.8 cm from the anterior margin in slice 7. The medial and lateral margins are grossiy clear (>1 cm). Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette E1: Mediat margin, slice 1 (representative perpendicular section). Cassette E2: Medial one-third, slice 2 (medial-most extent of lesion).
