UUID:EEB0E26D-3BF2-4D38-8D94-4251A03344D4 Redacted Diagnosis: A: Left kidney, nephrectomy - Renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type, eosinophilic variant, tumor size 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, nuclear grade 2 (of 4), tumor confined to kidney, surgical margins free of tumor. - Renal vein, artery and ureter with no tumor seen. - Portion of adrenal gland with no tumor seen B: Left adrenal gland, mass removal - Adrenal myelolipoma, tumor size 14 cm in greatest dimension. tcD-o-3 Comment: Carcunons, Renal cell None. Cuomephobe type 8317l3 Clinical History:e Cb4.9 year-old male with left adrenal mass. nO 9/z4|13 Gross Description: Received are two appropriately labeled containers.. Container A: Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: nephrectomy Size and weight of specimen: 500 grams, 14.5 x 10.0 x 4.8 cm Presence/absence of adrenal gland: questionably present, an area of yellow/orange discoloration is present in the perirenal adipose tissue, but not definitive for an adrenal gland. Tumor description: circumscribed, yellow/tan, soft, and partially encapsulated Tumor size: 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent, one focus is identified Confinement/Non-confinement to kidney: the tumor grossly appears to contain questionable areas of extracapsular extension into the surrounding fat Extent of invasion:. Perirenal adipose tissue: questionably involved

Renal vein: tumor does not grossly involve Ureter: tumor does not grossly involve Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: extends to within 0.8 cm of the closest black inked deep soft tissue margin Renal vein: negative Renal artery: negative Ureter:negative Description of kidney away from tumor: has a pink/tan, smooth, and grossly. unremarkable cut surface, with distinct corticomedullary junctions; the cortex contains two linear incisional defects, containing suture material, one located on each pole Lymph nodes (hilar): none Tissue submitted for special investigations: none Block Summary: A1 - vascular and ureteral margins A2 - tumor at closest approach to black ink A3,A4 - tumor at area of questionable extracapsular extension A5,A6 - additional representative tumor A7 - additional representative normal kidney A8 - representative section of area with adipose tissue containing an orange/yellow discoloration (possible portion of adrenal gland) Container B is additionally labeled "left adrenal mass." It holds a 1010 gram, 14.2 x 13.2 x 7.0 cm ovoid, circumscribed, soft tan/gray mass, containing areas of disrupted surface. A 10.0 x 1.0 cm area contains an orange/yellow minimal amount of adherent portion of tissue, consistent with adrenal gland. Sectioning reveals a soft, yellow/tan, focally hemorrhagic and focally necrotic cut surface. This mass. diffusely abuts the blue inked surgical margin. The area underlying the. yellow/orange surface has a red/brown, hemorrhagic cut surface, with a small, approximately 0.5 x 0.1 cm rim of orange yellow tissue, consistent with adrenal gland. B1-B5 - representative sections 36 - sections of area containing yellow/orange possible adrenal gland

Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. Specimen A: Histologic tumor type/subtype: renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type, eosinophilic variant Histologic grade (if applicable): 2 (of 4) Tumor size (greatest dimension): 3.5 cm Extent of tumor invasion: Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: negative Renal vein: negative Ureter: negativee Blood vascular: negative Lymphovascular: negative Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: free of tumor Renal vein: free of tumor Renal artery: free of tumor Ureter: free of tumor Adrenal gland: no tumor seen. Separately submitted specimen B shows a 14 cm myelolipoma of the adrenal gland. Lymph nodes: not identified Other significant findings: none
