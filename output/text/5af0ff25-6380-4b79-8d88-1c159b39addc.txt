FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Part 1: breast, Right, total mastectomy - A." MULTiFOCAL AND MULTiCENTRIC inFILTRATINg DUCTAL CARCInOMA (1B, 1D, 1E, 1F, 1G, 1H, 1m, 1N, 10 and 1T). B. THE TUmOR SIZES ARE AS FOLLOWS: 2.5 X 2 X 2.1 CM; 1.5 X 1.3 X 1 CM; 0.7 X 0.6 CM AND 0.6 X 0.5 CM (see comment). C.  NOTTINGHAM SCORE IS 6/9 (TUBULES 2, nUCLEI 2, MITOSES 2). D.  LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS NOT APPRECIATED.S E. DUCTAL CARCINOmA IN SITU, CRIBRiFORm TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE 2, REPRESENTING ABOUT LESS THAN 1% OF TUMOR VOLUmE. F. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH INVASIVE TUMOR. G. MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF TUMOR. H.  Nipple, free of tumor. SKIN, NO TUMOR IS SEEN. J.
