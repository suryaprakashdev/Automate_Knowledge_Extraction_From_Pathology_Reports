Preoperative Diagnosis. Renal cell carcinoma, status post right partial nephrectomy. Intraoperative Consultation. FSB1. RIGHT RENAL MASS INFERIOR MARGIN: Perpendicular cross section, adipose tissue - not cut, negative. FSC1.RIGHTRENALMASS SUPERIOR MARGIN Perpendicular, adipose tissue, not cut well, negative. FSD1. RIGHT RENAL MASS POSTERIOR MARGIN: Perpendicular, negative (adipose tissue, not cut well). Comment: These frozen section diagnoses/resuits were communicated to and acknowledged by Dr.  have performed the intraoperative consultations and issued the above diagnoses. Gross Description A. The specimen is received fresh labeled "right peritumoral fat."The specimen consists of multiple, irregular, unoriented tragments of lobulated adipose tissue, which range from 1 to 3.5 cm in. greatest dimension. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a grossly unremarkable cut surface.. No tissue is submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in 5 cassettes,A1-A5. B. The specimen is received fresh labeled "right renal mass, inferior margin." The specimen. consists of an irregular fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. The specimen. is oriented according to the surgeon's designation and inferior margin is inked blue. The specimen is. bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section as FsB1. C. The specimen is received fresh labeled "right renal mass, superior margin.* The specimen consists of an irregular fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.5x0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is oriented according to the surgeon's designation and the superiar margin is inked black. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section as FsC1. D. The specimen is received fresh labeled *right renal mass, posterior margin.* The specimen consists of an irregular fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is oriented according to the surgeon's designation and the posterior margin is inked black. No tissue was submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section as FSD1.. E. The specimen is received fresh labeled "right renal mass." The specimen consists of a partial nephrectomy with a moderate amount of lobulated adipose tissue of the renal hilum attached. The specimen measures 7 x 4 x 4.5 cm. The specimen is oriented by a surgeon and is inked as follows:  parenchymal resection margin is inked black, anterior adipose tissue resection margin is inked green,.

posterior orange, superior black, inferior blue. On sectioning, the specimen reveals a roughly ovoid,. ill-defined rubbery tumor mass,which measures 4 x 4 x 3.8 cm. Cut surface of the tumor is tan-red-brown, focally hemorrhagic. The tumor is bulging capsule and extends to within 0.2 cm of the. closest parenchyma resection margin. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the. Tissue Procurement Laboratory. The superior, inferior, and posterior resection margins are received. for frozen section analysis in separate contains. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in 10 cassettes as follows: E1-E2: Tumor in relation to the closest anterior adipose tissue resection margin. E3-E10: Tumor in relation to the closest parenchymal resection margin,  perpendicular sections. Cassette E10 mirror image of the section submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. w 1/3/4 Primary Tumor Site Discrepancy HIPAA Discrepan Case is (circle DISQUALIFIE
