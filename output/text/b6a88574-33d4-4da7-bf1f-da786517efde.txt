GROSS DESCRIPTION 1. Labeled "blue node, left axilla": The specimen consists of a bilobed blue dye stained apparent lymph node and fatty tissue. The fatty tissue is trimmed, revealing a 1ymph node that measures 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. It is bisected and a1l embedded as 1A. Cytokeratin stain. 2. Labeled "suspicious node, left axilla": The specimen consists of a tan yellow Fi rm  apparent lymph node that measures 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Bisected and all embedded as. 2A. 3. Labeled "segment, left breast, long stitch anterolateral, short stitch anteromedia1": The specimen consists of a blue dye stained piece of yellow tan tissue with orienting stitches. It measures 3.2 cm medial to lateral, 2.8 cm superior to inferior and 4.4 cm in depth. At the deep aspect of the tissue, there is a firm gritty tan nodule. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior - yellow, green - superior, black - lateral, blue - inferior, red - medial, orange - deep. 'Sections through the tissue show a gritty solid tan mass at the deep lateral aspect of the specimen, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm.. Representative tumor and_normal tissue are provided for xxxx research studies (irB# xxxxxxxxxxxxxx). Multiple representative sections are embedded serial1y from posterior to anterior as 3A-g (tumor in blocks 3A-d).. 4.. Labeled "addition segment, left breast, no orientation": The specimen consists of four pieces of yellow tan hemorrhagic and blue dye stained tissue that measure in aggregate approximately 6.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The tissue is focal1y firm, but no definite. tumor is identified grossly. Multiple representative sections are embedded as 4A-D, 4e- - additional firm areas of tissue. 5. Labeled "left breast lower quadrant mass": The specimen consists of three pieces of firm and soft tissue that measure in aggregate approximately 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. One piece represents a firm gray nodule, or portion thereof, measuring 1.4 x 0.8 c 0.2 cm.. The entire nodule and representative other tissue is embedded as 5A-B. 6. Labeled "inferior margin left breast": The specimen consists of a piece of gray yellow tissue that measures 2.3 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. Embedded as 6A.. 7. Labeled "superior margin left breast": The specimen consists of a piece of b1ue dye stained yellow tissue that measures 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. Embedded as 7A. Labeled "medial margin, left breast": The specimen consists of a piece of gray. yellow tissue that measures 2.2 x 1.3 x 0.3 cm. Embedded as 8A. 9. Labeled "lateral margin, left breast": The specimen consists of a piece of. Page 2

reddi sh yellow and gray tissue that measures 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. Embedded as 9A. 10. Labeled "anterior margin, left breast": The specimen consists of a piece of gray tissue that measures 1.6 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. Embedded as 10A. 11. Labeled "deep margin, left breast": The specimen consists of a piece of yellow red tissue that measures 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.2 cm. Embedded as 11A. 12. Labeled "left breast lower quadrant skin": The specimen consists of a piece of gray pink tissue that measures 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Embedded as 12A.. Microscopic h&e stained sections are prepared and interpreted. MICROSCOPIC Sections show an infiltrating mammary carcinoma characterized by poor tubule formation, intermediate nuclear grade and high mitotic activity. The tumor cells infiltrate as sheets, single file, alveolar nests and occasional larger nests. The tumor has a tendency to infiltrate around existing ductal structures and focally formd targetoid lesions around this. Focal early necrosis is noted. There is a desmoplastic stromal response.
