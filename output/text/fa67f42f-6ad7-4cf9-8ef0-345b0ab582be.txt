Surgical Pathology: Final: Surg Path UUID: CA834E5F-30DC-46CF-AF33-AD11226FC09E TCGA-B6-A0I2-01A-PR Redacted CLINICAL HISTORY: Bilateral carcinoma of the breast.. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Medial margin right breast biopsy", fresh. The specimen consists of 3.7 x 2.2 x 0.6 cm disc of firm white, unremarkable breast tissue; four sutures denote the true margin, which is inked black. Serial radial sections are submitted as follows: BLOCK SUMMARY: A1  frozen section remnant Af1 A2 frozen section remnant AF2. A3 frozen section remnant AF3. A4 additional tissue. B. "Right breast biopsy sample". Contains an irregular 10 x 0.5 x 1.7 cm disc tan-brown coarsely papillary tissue. Portions are submitted for ER/pR and for tissue bank and for frozen section. Frozen section remnant submitted in Block B1. "Left breast tumor, wide reexcision, long suture lateral, short suture. superior", fresh. The specimen consists of a 4.5 x 4.3 x 2.2 cm wide reexcision of the breast. The long suture denotes the lateral aspect of the specimen and a short suture the superior. The superior pole of the tissue is inked black, and the inferior blue. On cut section, there is a 1.3 x 1.3 x 1 cm round, white, firm, gritty, sharply-circumscribed tumor in the superior portion of the resection. tumor extends to within 2 mm of the superior margin, and does not approach The closely to any other margin. The remainder' of the breast consists of firm, white and tan admixed breast parenchyma. Tissue is divided into deep (towards chest wall) and superficial (towards skin) halves and submitted from medial to lateral as follows: BLOCK SUMMARY: C1 frozen section remnant cfl.. c2-C8  superficial half from medial to lateral.. c9-c15 deep half from medial to lateral. D. "Right axillary dissection and wide reexcision", fresh. The specimen consists of an excisional breast biopsy and attached axillary dissection. biopsy is incised, to obtain tissue for frozen section, ER/rr, and tissue  The bank, prior to receipt by pathology. The biopsy measures 6.7 x 6.5 x 3.2 cm.. The axillary tail measures 10 x 2.3 x 0.9 cm. The medial surface (not a true margin) is inked in red, the inferior margin black and the superior margin in blue. On cut section, there is a 4.5 x 2.3 x 2.5 cm white firm tumor, composed of the inked superior margin of resection and to within 1 cm of the superior and 5 mm of the inferior margin.. Tumor approaches to within 4 mm of the deep. margin of resection. The remainder of the breast is unremarkable The axillary dissection is divided into low, mid and distal level. There are numerous lymph nodes, ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 cm, none grossly involved by tumor. BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 of 2 se iscircle DISQUALIFIF Thye we +1311
