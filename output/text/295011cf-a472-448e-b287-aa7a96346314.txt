AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVEO THIS REPORT Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment RECUT RECUT RECUT RECUT RECUT Gross Description:. 1). The specimen is received fresh labeled "lelt kidney and adrenal gland' and consisls of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 370 g in total. The kidney measures 11.5 x 6 x 4 cm.The atlached ureter measures 9.5 cm. in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 1.5 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureler margins are grossly unremarkable.. An adrenal gland is idenlified measuring 4 x 1.5 x 1 .2 cm. The kidney is inked. black and bivalved to reveal a tumor mass located in the upper pole measuring 5.8 x 4.5 x 3 cm. The mass on sectioning has a. Iobulated appearance. variegated cut surface showing tan-yellow areas admixed with areas of hemorrhage and foci of necrosis.. Grossly it is confined within the kidney and does no! exiend beyond the capsule. In the mid aspect of the kidney, and 1 cm away. from the tumor mass is a serous fluid-filled cyst, measuring 5 x 5 x 4 cm.. The cyst wall is smooth. Sections through the. remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a well-defined corticomedullary junction. The cortex measures 0.8 cm and the calyces appear normal. No lymph nodos are identified in the perinephric fat. The specimen is photographed.. Representative sections are submitled for TPS and for permanent sections.. Summary of sections: FSC - frozen section control UVM -- ureteral and vessel morgins. TC- tumor in relation to kidney capsule  Paga 2 0f 4

AD -- adrenal gland 2)The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Segment distal left ureter'.  It consists a of a segment of pink tubular tissue measuring 2.1 cm in length with a diameter of 0.3 cm. A stapled end is noted. The specimen is inked black. It is otherwise. grossly unremarkable.The specimen is totally ambedded. Summary of sections:. SM-shaved stapted margin R-remainder 3).  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "para-aortic and pre-aortic lymph nodes", and consisls of three pieces of fally. tissue measuring 7.5 x 5 x 2.5 cm in aggregale. On sectioning, there is a soft tan nodule measuring 4 x 2. 1.5 cm, which on sectioning has areas of necrosis. There is a second 5.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm nodule that on sectioning shows lan yellow areas. In addition, there are smaller nodules measuring from 0.5 to 1 cm in greatest dimension. The small nodules are entirely submitted. Summary of seclions:. L1- lymph node. 5.5 cm, representalively. L2-lymph node, 4 cm representatively. LNs-smaller nodes 4) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled *Left common iliac lymph nodes". It consisls of multiple palpable lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.4 cm In greatest dimension. All possible nodal tissue is totally embedded in two casselles.. Summary of sections: LN-Jymph nodes 5) The specimen is received in formalin, fabeled Inter-aortocaval nodes". It consists of multiple small lymph nodes encased in. fat ranging in size from 0.4 to 0.8 cn in greatest dimension. All possible nodal tissue is totally embedded in three cassetles.
