METHODOLOGY: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, PARAFFIN BLOCK (C6). cOMMEnr: The lesion displays in-situ form of cancer that architecturally resembles the papillary transitional cell cancer, grade 1, commonly seen in. the bladder. In multiple areas, the base of the epithelium is cut on a bais, so that it cannot be determined whether the few cells seen in the superficial stroma are artifactual or the earliest form of microinvasion. While such a lesion, if seen in the bladder, would be called low grade, there is no recorded experience with such a neoplasm in the cervix. Dr. has reviewed the slides of the cervical tumor and concurs with the diagnosis. I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es). , M.D. Page# Electronically signed: ADDENDUM 2: Breast tissue was sent to the - estrogen and progesterone receptors. The estrogen receptor activity was , for assay of the. judged to be positIvE with an estimated FMoL value of 99. The progesterone receptor activity was judged as posiTive with an estimated rMoL value of 15. Please refer to for a complete report.
