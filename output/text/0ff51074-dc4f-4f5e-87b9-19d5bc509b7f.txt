MICROSCOPIC: Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis. The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu Hybridization Assays (Ish & Fish), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and Immunofluorescent Testing: The testing was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Department of Pathology, as required by the CLIA specific use by the U.s. Food and Drug Administration, but the FdA has determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. fixation  Tissue ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ("cLiA") as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical testing. Pursuant to the requirements of cLiA, AsR's used in this laboratory have been established and verified for accuracy and precision. Additional information about this type of test is available upon request.
