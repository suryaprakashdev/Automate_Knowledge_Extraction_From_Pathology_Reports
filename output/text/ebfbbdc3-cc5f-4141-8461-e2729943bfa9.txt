Page 3 of 3 Intraoperative Consuitation A. Sentinel node count 0 axilla, FS: No obvious malignancy. Final pending permanent section and perhaps IHC as original tumor was a lobular carcinoma.. B. Sentinel node count 609 axilla, FS: No obvious malignancy Final pending permanent section and perhaps IHC as original tumor was a lobular carcinoma.. Clinical History:. Biopsy proven multifocal carcinoma left breast. Please evaluate margins and if sentinel nodes are H&E (-), do serial sections and IHC Operation Performed Left total mastectomy, Sentinel node biopsy, possible axillary node dissection Pre Operative Diagnosis: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma left breast Specimen(s) Received: A: SEnTinel nODE COunt 0 AxILLA, fs B: SENTINEL NODE COUNT 609 AXILLA, FS C: LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY SINGLE SUTURE SUPERIOR, DOUBLE SUTURE MEDIAL D: ADDITIONAL MASTECTOMY SKIN Gross Description: A. Received fresh labeled "Sentinel node count 0 axilla" is a tan piece of tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in one cassette for trozen section. 8.  Received fresh labeled " Sentinel node count 609 axilla" is a piece of soft tissue with areas of adipose tissue that  measures 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.4 cm. Submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section. C. Received fresh labeled "Left breast mastectomy, single suture superior, double suture mediar' is a one kelo left modified radical mastectomy that measures 18.0 x 12.0 x 6.0 cm. There is a white skin ellipse that measures 7.0 x 3.0 cm and a nipple that measures 1.8 cm in diameter. There are two sutures. The single suture is superior and the double suture is medial. The specimen is inked in black. Upon sectioning, there are diffuse areas of white nodularities throughout the parenchyma. There is a firm, white nodular lesion that extends 2.0 cm away from the lateral margin to the midline. It  measures 7.0 x 6.0 x 4.0 cm and it is 1.0 cm away from the deep margin, 4.0 cm trom upper margin, 5.0 cm from the  probably from a previous biopsy site that measures 6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm. It is located 2.0 cm away from the superior margin, 1.5 cm from the deeper margin, 5.0 cm trom the inferior margin, 2.0 cm from the anterior margin. No other grossly identified.  There are 2/3 of stroma and 1/3 of adipose tissue. Sections submitted as follows:  lesions are Cassette #1 Nipple Cassettes #2-6  Several sections of tumor Cassette #7  Sections of tumor in relation to the superior margin Cassette #8 Deeper margin Cassette #9 Portion of retro-areolar area Cassettes #10&11 Superior inner quadrant Cassettes #12&13 Inferior inner quadrant Cassettes #14&15 Superior outer quadrant Cassettes #16&17 Inferior outer quadrant D.  Received in formalin labeled "Additional mastectomy skin" is an irregular piece of skin tissue measuring 14.0 x 7.0 x 1.2 cm. The specimen is white, pink and there were no abnormai lesions grossly identified. The specimen is not oriented. Representative sections are submitted in two cassettes Diagnosis
