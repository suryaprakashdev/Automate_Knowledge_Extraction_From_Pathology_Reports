No tumor seen. 3 Colon, distal ring. excision: Colonic mucosa with hyperplastic features. No tumor seen. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVEDS THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "sigmoid colon". It. consists of a portion of sigmoid colon that measures 18.5cm in length x 10.0. cm in open circumference at the distal margin. The serosal surface is pink. tan and unremarkable. The radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 9.0 cm from the. proximal margin and 6.0 cm from the distal margin..  The tumor measures 2.8 cm in length and 6.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor extending to a depth of 0.7 cm, through the muscularis and grossly approaching into the underlying pericolic fat. The tumor is 4.0 cm from the closest radial. margin. The remaining mucosa shows tan-yellow grossly unremarkable mucosal folds. Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections. are submitted. Tps is submitted. Summary of sections: DM -  distal margin RM - radial margin ** Continued on next page **

The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal margin" and consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. At the center of the pin, a green plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan. soft tissue is attached measuring 2.5 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm. The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted.  The sutures and staples are. removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted. Summary of sections:. U - undesignated 3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal ring" and consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm.  Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples oved and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.. Summary of sections:. U - undesignated.
