SENTINEL NODE #2 D. ADDITIONAL LATERAL POSTERIOR MARGIN INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: A-WLE right breast: Gross examination only, tumor is 0.8 cm from the nearest superior margin. TPB/TPC-SLN #1, #2: Touch imprints only, negative for tumor cells. Diagnoses called by Dr. to Dr. at . (A, B, C). GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. WLE RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and *wLE right breast needle localization" is a previously inked, oriented (single suture-anterior, double suture-lateral) 76 g, 3.7 x 3.6 x 2.9 cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral- red, inferior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 7 slices. revealing a 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm tan, stellate nodule that is closest to the superior margin at 0.8 cm.. Tissue is procured.

SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and *SLN #1" is a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm lymph node. It is sectioned, a touch prep is performed, lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette B1. C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and *SLN #2" it is a 1.7 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm lymph node. It is sectioned, a touch prep is performed, submitted entirely in cassette C1. D. ADDITIONAL LATERAL POSTERIOR MARGIN Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "additional lateral-posterior margin" is an oriented (suture at final margin) 9 g, 5 x 3 x 1.2 cm fibrofatty tissue. Final margin is inked blue. Serial sectioning reveals no discrete lesions. Entirely submitted in cassettes B1-B8. DIAGNOSIS:E A.
