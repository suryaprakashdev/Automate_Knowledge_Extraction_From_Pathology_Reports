See comment. THE TUMOR INVADES NEARLY FULL THICKNESS SCLERA, IN A PERINEURAL PATTERN Extraocular extension is not identified.. Vortex vein invasion is not identified.. The optic nerve is uninvolved by tumor.n. Retinal detachment associate with the tumor. Lens with nuclear sclerosis. Entire report and diagnosis completed by. COMMENT The tumor is predominately amelanotic, consisting of a spindled morphology. Mitotic count is 2 per 10 high power fields. Foca complex vascular loops are identified by PAS. Numerous levels were examined as the tumor extensively invades the sclera and approaches but does not extend extraocularly. The tumor is positive for pan-melanoma markers (MART1, HMB45, tyrosinase) and negative for synaptophysin, consistent with the diagnosis of melanoma.. eB 87243 CONSULTANT(S) 069.8 y J i/i6(14 GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT GLOBE - An intact right eye (22.0 mm AP x 24.0 mm horizontally x 21.0 mm vertically) and attached optic nerve (7.0 mm in length). The cornea is transparent (12.0 mm horizontally x 11.0 mm vertically), anterior chamber is visible, encompassed. by an irregular green-brown iris (6.5 x 8.0 mm in diameter). At the 2-4 o'clock position of the iris, a mass is present along the limbus. The sclera is unremarkable. On transillumination, a shadow is present from 2-4 o'clock extending from the iris and limb. to 0.2 mm from the optic nerve. The superior calotte is removed first for tissue harvest. The vitreous is clear. The tan tumor (18. 11 x 6 mm in height) is loosely attached to the sclera with a loosely adherent retina over the surface of the tumor. SECTION CODE: A1, superior temporal vortex vein; A2, superior nasal vortex vein; A3, inferior nasal vortex vein; A4, inferior temporal vortex vein; A5, pupil optic nerve section; A6, superior calotte; A7, inferior calotte; A8, loose portion of tumor..
