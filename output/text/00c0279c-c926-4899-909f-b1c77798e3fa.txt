2 of 3 Appendix Fibrous obliteration of the lumen Lymph Nodes: Number with metastasis: 1 Total number examined: 24. Tumor deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue: Identieied Tumor Staging (Acc 7th Edition): pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pexicolorectal tissues) Lymph Node Stage (Awcc 7th Edition): N1 (Metastasig in 1-3 regional lymph nodes) PENDING K-RAS. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Result Special Stain Comment KRAS Gross Description: 1).The specimen is received freah, labeled "Right hemicolectomy colon' and consists of a segment of terminal ileun, cecum with attached appendix and. ascending colon. The terminal ileum measuxes 7.5 cm in length and 3.5 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures. 19 in length with a circumference of 8 cm at the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measures 6.5 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in. diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length ot the specimen measuring up to 5' cm in thickness. The gpecimen is opened to. reveal a circumferential, centrally ulcerative, fungating, brown tan tumor measuring 5.5 cm in length, 6.5 cm in width, and 2.0 cm in height. On cut section of the tunox, it measures 2.5 cm in maximun depth and abuts the. black inked radial margin..  The tumor is located 6.3 cm from the ileocecal valve and 6 cm from the distal resected margin. Alao identified, 4.0 cm from. the ileocecal valve and 4.2 cm from the main tumor mass, there is a brown-tan polypoid structure measuring 1.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm.  The remaining mucosa shows brown-tan folded appearance and several polypoid areas measuring up to 0.4 x 0.3 cm in greatest dimensions, which are entirely Submitted. The apecimen is submitted fox lymph node dissection. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are aubmitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted. Continued on next page.

Specimeng Submitted: 1: DM SUBMITTED 1O UNSTAINED SLIDES AND 1 H&E, RIGHT COLON Test Performed:. KRAs Gene Exon 2 mutation analyais (codons 12 and 13) DNA quality: good. Methodology: PCR was performed to amplify exon 2 of the KRAs gene from genomic DNA prepared from the submitted tigaue. The pcr product was analyzed on an ABI DIAGNOSTIC INTERPRETATION: Negative for KRAs exon 2 mutation.. Technical sensitivity: This asaay'cannot detect a xRAs exon 2 mutation if the proportion of tumor cells in the sample studied is less than 25%. 1. This result cannot be used as sole evidence for or against cancer and has to be interpreted in the context of all available clinical and pathological information. 2. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Laboratory of Diagnostic Molecular Pathology. It has not been cleared or approved by the. U.S. Food and Drug. Administration (Fba). The FDa has determined that such clearance is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes.. Pursuant to the requirements of CLia : 88,. oux laboratory has established the accuracy and precision of this test. This test has been approved by as a laboratory specific assay..

Technical sensitivity: This test may not detect certain mutations if the proportion of tunor cells in the sample studied is less than 10%.. Test Performed:d Sequenom masa-spectrometry genotyping for specific mutations in 8 genes:. AKT1, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1 (MAP2KI), NRAS, and PIK3CA Methodology: The specific mutations are detected by amplification of the corresponding. exons by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), followed by a single base. extension at the site of the point mutation. The single base extension product is detected by tandem mass-spectrometry on a Sequenom MassArray Spectrometer. Addendum Comment PLATE# P10-42 ** Continued on next page **
