Grossly uninvolved kidney. 1H. Distal aspect of pancreas.. 11. Adrenal mass at kidney. 1J. Spleen. 1K-L. Tumor. PROCEDURE: SPDX 1. Adrenal gland, spleen, distal pancreatectomy and nephrectomy, composite. resection: Adrenal cortical carcinoma, oncocytic type, with minimal capsular invasion, 16 cm in greatest dimension, low-grade by mitotic activity. No. vascular invasion identified. Resection margins negative. Unremarkable. pancreas, spleen and kidney. See coMmEnt.. COMMENT : This cortical neoplasm does show signiticant areas of necrosis, and this. raises the possibitity, however untikely, that the necrotic neoplasm. represents high-grade carcinoma. Case discussed at examined and interpreted the slides from this case..
