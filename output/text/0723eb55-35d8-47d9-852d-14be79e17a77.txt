/cs-0-3 Carcinoma, mfiltnuting 1obulu,Nos 85xo/3 PH Sih: Brst, usq C50.4 CQCF9if: Aust,Nos C5o.9 Diagnosis: 1. Polymorphocellular undifferentiated breast, G il (maximum tumor diameter 2.8 cm) showing infiltrative growth, with marked chronic secondary inflammation, focal invasion of lymph vessels and spread to just below the skin.. The conventional histological findings are consistent with the polymorphocellular variant of invasive lobular breast carcinoma. The nodular tumor infiltration in the axillary tissue described under 6. is to be interpreted as a lymph node metastasis extending beyond the capsule into the surrounding soft tissue. This gives rise to the following summary tumor classification: G II, pT2pN1a(1/14)L1V0R0, negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors, positive for C-erb B-2 oncoprotein.. 306BE26-0358-4BE4-AEF6-AD42CC0DA020 Redacted
