COLON, PROXIMAL RING; EXCISION: BENIGN COLONIC TISSUE. A DETACHED FRAGMENT OF ADENOMATOUS MUCOSA IS NOTED. 3. COLON, DISTAL RING; EXCISION: - BENIGN COLONIC TISSUE. Some of the immunohistochemistry and Ish tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.. They have not been cleared or approved by the Us Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1. The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Sigmoid". It consists of. an undesignated sigmoid colon (19.5 cm in length and ranges in circumference. from 6.2 to 8.0 cm) with attached pericolonic fat (17.3 x 8.5 x 2.5 cm). The. ** Continued on next page **

serosal surface is pink, glistening and intact. The presumed distal resection margin is inked black and presumed proximal resection margin is inked red. The specimen is opened to reveal an exophytic, bosselated, tumor (6.5 cm in length and 4.5 cm in width) that is located 10.0 cm from the proximal margin and 4.5 cm from the distal margin. Serial sectioning reveals the tumor has a depth of 2.5 cm. Thorough sectioning show that the tumor appears to be limited to the muscularis propria without invasion beyond the muscle. There is 2nd tan polypoid mass , located 1.5 cm from the tumor which is sampled. The remaining mucosa is grossly unremarkable. Pericolic and perirectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. The tumor area is extensively sampled. Tps is submitted.. Summary of sections: PM - proximal margin, shave DM - distal margin, shave T tumor P- polypoid mass. U - uninvolved mucosa LN - lymph nodes BLN bisected lymph node TU more sections from the tumor. 2. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal ring" and consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. At the center of the pin, a blue plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan soft tissue is attached measuring 2.3 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm. The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and staples are. removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U--undesignated 3. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal ring" and consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.2 x 1.9 x 0.8 cm..  Multiple sutures and staples are attached..  The mucosal surface is pink tan and. focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted. Summary of sections:.
