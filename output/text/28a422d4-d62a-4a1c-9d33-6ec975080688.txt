DiffUSe mALIgnAnT mESOtheLIOmA, EpItheLIOId TYPE, EXTenDING InTO ADJACEnt LUNG PARENCHYMA (see comment). B.  PLEURAL HYALINE PLAQUE. COMMENT: The histomorphology of the tumor shows a diffuse mallgnant mesothelloma with a predominantly epithellold variant. However, a tubulopapillary pattern is focally seen. Addendum Probe: Dual Color Probee RESULTS : Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on the malignant mesothelioma demonstrate 1 (1.6%) cells with homozygous loss and 10 (15.6%) of cells with hemizygous loss. The ratilo of p16 (9p21) to the centromere of chromosome 9 was 0.95. The targeted region (total 64 cells) is considered to be NEGAtivE for p16 (9p21) deletlon. Interpretation guldelines for 9p21 by FISH: Ratio of p16 to the centromere of chromosome 9: Normal Range Ratlo: 0.85-1.19  Normal % deletion: less than 20% Clinical studies Indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p16 deletion in malignant mesotheliomas. FISH analysls was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minlmum of 60 cells.
