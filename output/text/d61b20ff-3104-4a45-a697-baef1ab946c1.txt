Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT COMMENT: The majority of the invasive carcinoma is characterized by solid sheets of high-grade malignant cells. In some areas, tumor cells have prominent spindle cell morphology, whereas in other areas, the malignant cells retain vaguely epithelioid (rounded) shapes, but have highly anaplastic nuclear features. Prominent tumor- associated necrosis is present, and no discernable glandular differentiation is evident. The morphologic appearance of these areas is compatible with designation as sarcomatoid (metaplastic) carcinoma. Other areas of tumor contain malignant cells present in close proximity to blue-gray chondromyxoid or hyaline matrix, compatible with at least focal matrix-producing carcinoma, another subtype of metaplastic breast carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining shows some scattered tumor cells to be positive for p63 and CK5/6, in support of designation as metaplastic carcinoma. This Is in accordance with IHC staining performed on the previous biopsy In addition, some tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin, a feature not uncommon in metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinoma, representing immunohistochemical evidence of differentiatlon towards a myoepithelial phenotype. Staining for and S100 are negative in tumor cells. Focally, the invasive carcinoma is seen in association with a fibroepithelial neoplasm, a portion of which appears to be necrotic. The stroma of the fibroepithelial neoplasm does not show striking hypercellularity, except for a few areas in which there is granulation tissue. The lack of stromal cellularity within this lesion argues that the fibroepithelial neoplasm is best regarded as fibroadenoma, even though the lesion has some architectural features of phyllodes tumor. In some areas, high-grade malignant cells are seen to line the ducts/clefts of the fibroadenoma, suggesting that the carcinoma is invading into the fibroadenoma. Another possibility is that the carcinoma has arisen out of the epithelial component of the fibroadenoma, which is considered less likely. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are highly malignant tumors with capability to metastasize to distant sites (hematogenous metastasis to sites such as liver, lung, brain, etc.), even though some studies have shown that metastasis to axillary lymph nodes are significantly less frequent than in more typical cases of breast carcinoma (i.e. invasive Case #: Page 2 Printed: This report continues...

Additional Axillary Contents Clinical History/Operative Dx: Cancer, female breast, upper-outer Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled left simple mastectomy and is received in formalin. It consists of a mastectomy specimen which weighs 1430 grams. A white suture at one end of the skin ellipse designates the lateral portion of the excision. With this orientation the specimen measures 26 cm from media! to Iateral, 17.5 cm from superior to inferior, and is up to 6 cm from superficial to deep. There is an overlying broad ellipse of tan-white skin which measures 26 x 15 cm. In the central slightly medial portion of the. skin there is a 4 cm areola with a protuberant 1.2 cm nipple. The medial-inferior skin displays a 0.7 cm plaque-like brown skin lesion. No other skin lesions are present. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of predominantly smooth fascial tissue, is inked black. The breast is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal coarsely Iobulated fatty tissue and scattered tan-white fibrous parenchyma. The fibrous parenchyma contains. multiple punctate areas of fine nodularity throughout the breast with scattered blue-dome cysts. There are  no areas which have a stellate or retracted appearance.

A lymph node and random sections of breast tissue are submitted in cassette A13.. B. The specimen is labeled right modified radical mastectomy and is received without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy specimen which weighs 1681 grams. A suture marks the axillary tissue. With this orientation the breast measures 26 cm from medial to lateral, 16 cm from superior to inferior, and 6.5 cm from superficial to deep. The axillary portion measures 9 x 7 x 3 cm. The breast has an overlying broad ellipse of tan skin measuring 25 x 16 cm. There is a medial and slightly inferiorly located poorly delineated 4 cm areola with a protuberant 1.2 cm nipple. The central skin surface bulges outward in the periareolar area over a distance approximately 8 cm. The skin is otherwise tan-white and unremarkable. Sections of the bulging anterior skin reveal a partially hemorrhagic cavitary lesion which measures 7 cm from medial to laterai, 7 cm from superior to inferior, and up to 3.5 cm from superficial to deep. The cavitary space is filled with gray-tan tissue which has a finely lobulated appearance. Just inferior to the cavitary space along the lateral edge there is creamy tan-white moderately firm fibrous breast parenchyma. Representative tissue obtained for research purposes. Following fixation the anterior- superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists predominantly of smooth fascial tissue, is inked black. The breast is serially sectioned from the posterior surface at close intervals to reveal the cavitary lesion described above.
