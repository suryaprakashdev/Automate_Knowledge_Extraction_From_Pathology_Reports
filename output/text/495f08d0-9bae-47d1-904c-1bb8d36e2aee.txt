FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Part 1: breast, left, 2 O'clock, segmental mastectomy - A.  InVasiVe DUctal CarcinQmA, nOs type, with mIcrocalcIFications. B. NOtTinghAm GRADE: 1 (tuBULE fORmAtiOn - 2, nUCLEAR PLEOmORphISm ~ 2, mITOtIC AcTIvIty  1, TOTal SCOre: 5/9). C. THE INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 2.1 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION (SLIDE 1B). D. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2, CRIBRIFORM TYPE. E. DCIS CONSTITUTES 10% OF TOTAL TUMOR MASS AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH THE INVASiVE COMPONENT. F. NO LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS NOTED (SEE COMMENT #1). G. RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR iNVASIVE CARCINOMA OR DCIS, INVASIVE COMPONENT IS 0.7 CM AWAY FROM THE CLOSEST (POSTERIOR) MARGIN (SEE COMMENT #2). H. LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS) AND ATYPICAL LOBULAR HYPERPLASIA (SEE COMMENT #3). I. NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST SHOWS FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE, APOCRINE METAPLASIA AND SCLEROSING ADENOSIS WITH MICROCALCIFICATIONS.  THe InVASIVe TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE fOR ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS AND . NEGATIVE FOR HER-2/NEU, AS PER PREVIOUS PATHOLOgY REPORT ( PART 2: AXILLA, LEFT NUMBER ONE SENTINEL LYMPH NODE, EXCISION - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1) (SEE COMMENT #4). part 3: AxilLA, Left number TwO Sentinel Lymph nOde, eXcisiOn - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1). PARt 4: AxILLA, LEft numbeR threE SenTinel Lymph nOde, EXciSIOn -- Two lymph nodes, negative for carcinoma inios.
