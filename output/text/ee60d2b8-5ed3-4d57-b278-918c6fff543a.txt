Part A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis labeled "distal ureter margin right" and consists of a 0.7 x 0.4 x0 .2 cm portion of tan tissue, which is submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis as FSA1. The frozen section residue is submitted as (A1). Frozen section diagnosis: FSA1 -- Right distal ureter margin -- "No tumor seen.' ExamIned by Part B is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis labeled left distal ureter margin" and consists of a 1.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm strip of tan soft tissue, which is submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis as FSB1. The frozen section residue is submitted as (B1). UUID:65FF34F8-65D4-4DC8-80D8-FED4D8244F4B Frozen section diagnosis: TCGA-R3-A69X-01A-PR Redacted FSB1 -- Left distal ureter margin -- "No tumor seen.

Part C is received in formalin labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of a 5 cm portion of adipose tissue, which contains eight 0.2 cm -- 1.7 cm lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are submitted In their entirety as (C1)-(C5). SLIDE KEY C1 -- four possible lymph nodes C2-C5 -- one bisected lymph node per cassette Part D is received fresh labeled "bladder/prostate" and consists of a 6 x 5 x 4 cm urinary bladder, in. continuity with 2 x 0.5 cm segments of bilateral ureters, symmetrical 4 x 3 x 3 cm prostate gland with bilateral 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm seminal vesicles and a moderate amount of soft perivesicular adipose tissue. There are multiple staples over the mid anterior aspect of the prostate and bladder. The right side of the specimen is inked blue, the left side is black and the mid anterior aspect of the prostate Is inked orange. The bladder is opened to dlsclose a 3 x 1.9 cm ulcer over the right posterior wall, mid posterior walls, extending to left lateral wall and overlying the left ureteral orifice. Sections through the ulcer show a 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm firm gray-white mass within the left posterior wall and left lateral wall. The mass extends through the bladder wall, 1.6 cm from the left lateral soft tissue margin. The mass does not grossly. Involve the prostate gland and is located approximately 4.5 cm from the urethral margin. The mass does not grossly involve the right side of the bladder. The remaining bladdar mucosa is tan and trabeculated without additional gross lesions. Sections through the prostate gland show a well-defined 0.4 cm white nodule within the right side, near the apex. The remainder of the prostate gland consists of dense tan tissue with focal fine honeycombing. No gross lesions can be identified within the seminal vesicles. No Iymph nodes can be identified within the specimen. Fresh tumor is taken for TCGA. Representative sectlons are submitted as (D1)-(D24). SLIDE KEY D1 -- right ureter D2 - left ureter D3 -- right prostate apex margin D4 -- left prostate apex margin D5 -- trigone/prostatic urethra D6 -- trigone/right ureteral orifice D7 - trigone/left ureteral orifice D8 -- left lateral soft tissue margin D9-D11 -- Jeft lateral bladder lesion D12 -- right posterior bladder D13 -- right lateral bladder D14 -- anterior bladder. D15 -- dome of bladder D16-D19 -- right side of prostate, apex to base D20-D23 -- left side of prostate, apex to base D24 -- seminal vesicles Part E is received in formalin labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of a 3 cm aggregate of adipose tissue, which contains a 2.5 cm partially fatty lymph node. The lymph node is submitted in its entirety as (E1). Page 2 of 4

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTiON Sections examined on multiple H&E-stained slides.. Surglcal Pathology Cancer Case Summary, Urinary Bladder -- Radical Cystoprostatectomy: SPECIMEN: Bladder and prostate. PROCEDURE: Radical cystoprostatectomy. TUMOR SrTE: Invasive tumor is noted along the left posterior and left lateral bladder wall. TUMOR SiZE: 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm. HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Urothelial cell carcinoma.. ASSOCIATED EPITHELiAL LESIONS: Focal carcinoma In situ also present. HISTOLOGIC GRADE: High grade. MICROSCOPIC TUMOR EXTENSION: Through detrusor muscle into perivesical fat. MARGINS: Not involved. Tumor does extend to within 0.7 cm of the left lateral perivesical fat margin. LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION: Present, extensive. PATHOLOGIC STAGING: Primary Tumor: pT3, tumor invades perivesical tissue. Grossly, the tumor did appear to extend through the detrusor muscle. However, a true extravesicular mass was not identified. As such, I would favor that this is best categorized as a pT3a rather than pT3b. Regional Lymph Nodes: pN0, no lymph node metastases. Number of lymph nodes examined: 7. Surgical Pathology Cancer Case Summary, Prostate Gland -- Radlcal Prostatectomy: PROCEDURE: Radical cystoprostatectomy. PROSTATE SIZE: 4 x 3 x 3 cm. Cannot give accurate weight as the prostate was part of a larger cystoprostatectomy procedure. LYMPH NODE SAMPLING: Pelvic lymph nodes present. HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Adenocarcinoma (acinar, not otherwise specified) HISTOLOGIC GRADE: Primary Pattern: Grade 3. Secondary Pattern: Grade 4.. Total Gleason Score: 7 (moderately poorly differentiated). TUMOR QUANTITATION: Tumor comprises approximately 2% of the submitted prostate tissue. EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION: Not identified. SEMINAL VESICLE INVASION: Not identified. MARGINS: Not involved. TREATMENT EFFECT: Not identified. LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION: Not identified. PERINEURAL INVASION: Present. PATHOLOGIC STAGING: Primary Tumor: pT2c, bilateral disease. Regional Lymph Nodes: pN0, no regional lymph node metastasis.. Number of lymph nodes examined: 7, none involved (0/7).. Page 3 of 4
