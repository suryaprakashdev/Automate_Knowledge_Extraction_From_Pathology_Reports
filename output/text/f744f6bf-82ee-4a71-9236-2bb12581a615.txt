Gross Description: The specimen is received in sixteen parts, each labeled with the patient's name Part A received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "right vocal cord biopsy" and consists of a 0.2 cm in greatest dimension irregular, gray-tan soft tissue, which has been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette A. Note, it is questionable as to whether this specimen will survive processing.. Part B received in formalin labeled "level 1 neck dissection, left" and consists of a portion of irregular, ragged, focally fragmented, gray-yellow to red-brown,. focally cauterized fibrofatty tissue, which has dimensions of 8.5 x 5.2 x 2.8 cm. The fat contains a gray-yellow, lobulated salivary gland, which has dimensions of 4.8 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm. There are no focal lesions identified within the salivary gland. Sectioning through the remainder of the fat reveals eleven probable lymph nodes that range from 0.4 to 2.7 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is grossly positive.. Representative sections are submitted as labeled:. B1  salivary gland;. B2 four lymph nodes submitted in toto; B3 one bisected lymph node; B4 one bisected lymph node; B5 a representative section of the largest grossly positive lymph node;. B6 one bisected lymph node; B7 one bisected lymph node; B8 one bisected lymph node; B9 one bisected lymph node. Part C received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "base of tongue at hyoid" and consists of three irregular, gray-tan soft tissues, which have. greatest dimensions of approximately 0.3 cm each, which have been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette C. Part D received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "distal lingual nerve margin" and consists of a 0.4 cm in greatest dimension irregular gray-tan soft tissue, which has been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette D. Part E received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "left lingual artery biopsy" and consists of two irregular, gray-tan soft tissues, which have

greatest dimensions of 0.2 and 0.6 cm, which have been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette E. Part F received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "deep tongue base margin #1" and consists of a 0.8 cm in greatest dimension irregular, gray-tan soft tissue, which has been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette F. Part G received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "tongue base mucosa margin" and consists of two irregular, gray-tan soft tissues, which have greatest dimensions of 0.3 and 0.7 cm, which have been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette G. Part H received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "anterior mucosa margin" and consists of three irregular, gray-tan soft tissues, which have greatest dimensions of 0.3, 0.7 and 0.9 cm, which have been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette H. Part I received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "anterior inferior mucosa margin" and consists of an irregular, gray-tan soft tissue, which has a greatest dimension of 1.0 cm. The specimen has been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette 1. Part J received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "posterior medial mucosa margin" and consists of an irregular, gray-tan soft tissue, which has a greatest dimension of 1.1 cm, which has been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette J. Part K received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "deep medial margin" and consists of an irregular, gray-tan soft tissue, which has a greatest dimension of 0.6 cm. The specimen has been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette K. Part L received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "posterior deep base of tongue" and consists of three irregular, gray-tan soft tissues, which have greatest dimensions of 0.1, 0.6 and 0.8 cm, which have been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette L. Part M received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "proximal lingual nerve biopsy" and consists of a 0.7 cm in greatest dimension irregular, gray-tan soft tissue, which has been submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis and the residue resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette M.

Part N is received in formalin labeled "left tongue lesion" and consists of a  previously inked and incised portion of left tongue, which has dimensions of 5.6 x 4.9 x 2.3 cm. The specimen was initially received fresh with tissue submitted to the Tissue Bank. The deep surface is irregular, gray-brown and focally cauterized. The mucosa is gray-tan and diffusely granular. The lateral border of the tongue is remarkable for an ulceration, which has dimensions of 1.8 x 1.2 cm. This ulceration extends to within 0.2 cm of the nearest inferior lateral mucosal edge. The specimen is further sectioned to reveal a gray-white, granular indurated mass, which has dimensions of 3.6 x 2.2 x 1.3 cm. This mass is contiguous with the aforementioned ulceration. This mass extends to the soft tissue edge at numerous sites. There is some loosely attached soft tissue at the inferior lateral aspect of the specimen, which has dimensions of 3.0 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm. This tissue is sectioned to reveal a gray-tan, lobulated cut surface that is grossly suggestive of salivary gland. Also, the soft tissue is remarkable for focal granularity, fibrosis and induration. These foci are highly suspicious. Representative sections are submitted as labeled:  N1-4 mass to include ulceration and close mucosal edges in cassettes N1 and N2, as well as deep soft tissue edges in. cassettes N3 and N4;. N5 apparent salivary gland; N6 associated soft tissue with suspicious appearing foci Part O received in formalin labeled "left neck dissection level 2-4" and. consists of a portion of irreguiar, ragged, gray-yellow to red-brown, lobulated fibrofatty and fibromuscular tissue, which has dimensions of 11.4 x 4.0 x 1.8 cm. The fat contains 16 probable lymph nodes that range from 0.3 to 4.8 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is grossly positive. The lymph nodes are submitted as labeled:. 01 six lymph nodes submitted in toto;. 02 three lymph nodes submitted in toto;. O3  five lymph nodes submitted in toto; O4-5  one trisected lymph node; 06  representative section of the largest, grossly positive lymph node. Part P received in formalin labeled "left neck dissection level 2B" and consists of a portion of irregular, ragged, gray-yellow to red-brown, focally cauterized, Iobulated fat, which has dimensions of 2.6 x 2.2 x 0.9 cm. The fat contains eight probable lymph nodes that range from 0.6 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted in toto in cassettes P1 and P2. Microscopic Description:. Histologic examination reveals a left glossectomy specimen and left neck dissection specimen. The glossectomy specimen is notable for a deeply invasive  keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma exhibiting moderate differentiation. Both perineural and lymphovascular invasion are prominent. The neck dissection demonstrates multiple metastatic nodes, the largest of which is 4.8 cm with extracapsular spread.
