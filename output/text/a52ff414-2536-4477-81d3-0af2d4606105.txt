(C) LEFT NECK DISsECTION, LEVEL 3 --A (2.8 x 2.7 x 0.6 cm) aggregate of fibroadipose tissue. The tissue is dissected to reveal five possible lymph nodes, ranging from (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm - 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm) SECTION CODE: C1. C2, two possible lymph nodes in each; C3, one possible lymph node bisected. (D) COMPOSITE RESECTION LEFT PARTIAL MAXILLA TUBEROSITY, LEFT PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY, LEFT SEGMENTAL MANDIBULECTOMY, LEFT PARTIAL PHARYNGECTOMY -- A composite section consisting of a segment of mandible with angle and condyles, posterior portion of pharynx, posterior maxillary tuberosity and medial portion of tongue with underlying skeletal muscle. The specimen measures 8 cm from anterior to posterior, 4.9 cm from lateral to medial and 4.6 cm from superior to inferior. The mucosal surface shows an ulcerated area (3.2 x 2.4 cm) which is located 0.4 cm from the lateral buccal margin, 0.7. cm from the medial tongue margin, 1.3 cm from the anterior soft tissue margin, and 1.7 cm from the posterior pharyngeal margin.. Cut surfaces show gray-white firm tissue underlying the ulcerated area, extending to a depth of 0.8 cm. The bone underlying this. ulcerated area shows fine pitting and deformity. Representative sections are submitted. The bone is submitted to the bone lab following decalcification and further sectioning.  SECTION CODE: D1, anterior soft tissue; D2-D9, representative serial sections from anterior to posterior including ulcer (D3-D4, D5-D6, D7-D8, one cross section each); D10, posterior pharyngeal soft tissue.  D11, anterior margin; D12, D13, pitted bone underlying ulcerated area; D11-D13, submitted for decalcification. (E) MEDIAL PTERyGOID PLATE -- A portion of bone with attached fibromuscular tissue (2.2 x 1.7 x 1 cm). Cut surfaces of the soft tissue are unremarkahle. The soft tissue is submitted in E1 and the bone is submitted to the bone lab for decaicification and further sectioning Representative section of the pterygoid plate submitted in E2 for decalcification. (F) LATERAL BUCCAL MUCOSAL MARGIN - A single strip of mucosa (3 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm). The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in F. *FS/DX: NO TUmOr PrESENT (G) POSTERIOR ALVEOLAR MUCOSAL MARGIN - A single inked strip of soft tissue (2.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is submitted entirely ink side down for frozen section diagnosis in G. *FS/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT. (H) SOFT PALATE MUCOSAL MARGIN - A single strip of mucosa (3.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in H. *FS/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT. (I) LEFT MAxILLARY GINGIVA - A single mucosa covered soft tissue (1 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in I. *FS/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT. CLINICAL HISTORY SNOMED CODES T-11180, T-11170. T-55000. T-53000. M-80703.
