POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer.. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. The snerimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, is designated as "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1". It consists of~multiple fragments of pink to yellow/tan, irregularly shaped tissue, which measure 2.5 x 2.0 x i.0 cm in loose aggregate. The specimen is submitted entirely. 1cF R. The snecimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, and is designated as "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2". It consists of a 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm piece of fatty tissue containing a 2.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm lymph node. The node is bisected, revealing extensive fat infiltration. One half of the node is submitted for Cbcp protocol; the remaining half is submitted for paraffin section in cassette B2. 2CF C. The snecimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,  and is designated "LEFT BREAST TISSUE - ONE STITCH MEDIAL, TWO STITCHES SUPERIOR, THREE STITCHES ANTERIOR". 210 gm portion of fatty tissue,which measures 11.5 x 8.5 x 2.7 cm. The It consists of a specimen is oriented with sutures (long single medial, two stitches superior, three stitches anterior). Ink code: blue superior posterior, orange, superior anterior, black inferior posterior, green inferior anterior. ~Sectioning reveals a well circumscribed, slightly lobulated tan tumor in the lateral portion of the specimen, measuring 2.2~x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. On cut section, the tumor has a centrally placed hemorrhage filled cavity, consistent with prior biopsy. The tumor is at least 1.0 cm from the near margin (black, orange). " The remaining tissue is predominantly fatty with a 1.0 cm area of fibrous tissue punctuated with yellow flecks about 3.0 cm medial to the tissue abutting the green inked margin. Multiple sections are submitted for cBcp protocol with matching paraffin sections as follows:. C1: grossly normal fibrofaty tissue, approximately 5.0 cm medial to tumor. c2: fibrous area with yellow flecks.. c3: tumor. C4: tumor. Additional sections are submitted. c5 and c6: lateral margin..
