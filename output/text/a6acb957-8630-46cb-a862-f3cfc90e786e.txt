The neoplastic cells have high NC ratio. with large pleomorphic hyperplastic nuclei and are arranged in solid sheets and. single cells.. Extensive desmoplastic change is seen. The tumor extends through. the muscularis propria into the perivesical soft tissue to involve the peritoneum.. Multiple satellite tumor nodules are identified in the perivesical soft tissue.. No carcinoma in situ is identified. Extensive lymphovascular space invasion is seen.. Sections of the prostate show focal prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm (pin II and. III) characterized by hyperplastic glands lined by stratified layers of enlarged cells with corresponding large nuclei and variable prominent nucleoli.. E-R: See microscopic-diagnoses.
