Patient Results UUID: 3CCFB076-52BE-4A5D-9E49-65516AA9C349 Requested By: TCGA-FF-A7CQ-01A-PR Redacted Histopathology Report Biopsy No Received Date/Time Final Final  Reporting Information Date/Time :  Final Histopathologist : Laboratory : Consultant-In-Charge Final Submitting Physician NOT STATED Final  Histopathology Report Final DIAGNOSIS RIGHT CERVICAL LYMPH NODE; EXCISION : DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA. GROSS DESCRIPTION Received in formalin is a specimen labelled with patient's data and designated "lymph node biopsy". It consists of 3 pieces of brownish tissue measuring 1.2 x 1 x 0.4cm, submitted entirely. (Al; no reserve) A separate piece of tissue received fresh measuring 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5m is snap-frozen for storage. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Histology shows a fragmented lymph node with architectural effacement by a diffuse, patternless proliferation of lymphomatous large cells with a centroblastic nucleolar disposition, scattered mitoses and foci of plasmacytoid proliferation is strongly positive for pan-B cell marker cd20 and coexpresses postgerminal centre-associated transcription factor Mum.l, but not cD138, which decorates only small numbers of scattered mature plasma cells. The lymphomatous accounted for by physiological expression in admixed, cD3-positive, reactive, small T-lymphocytes, albeit focally plentiful, while being negative for germinal centre-associated antigen coio, which highlights only occasional stromal cells and polymorphs, in keeping with an "activated B-cell" phenotypic profile, thereby excluding Burkitt lymphoma in conjunction with a celi proliferation immunolabelling, as well as a lymphoblastic neoplasm in conjunction with negativity for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, which highlights only a few, scattered, circulating haematogones. Immunostaining for Cyclin Dl is negative within the lymphoid proliferation, highlighting only physiological expression in scattered histiocytic and activated endothelial nuclei, excluding a transformed mantle cell lymphoma. Only a few overrun or disrupted cD2l-immunoreactive follicular dendritic meshworks are discerned, providing no support for an origin from a transformed follicular lymphoma.
