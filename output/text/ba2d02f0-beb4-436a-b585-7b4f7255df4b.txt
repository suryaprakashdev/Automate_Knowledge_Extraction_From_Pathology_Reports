LYMPH NODE, LEFT SENTINEL, EXCISION: - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY. B. BREAST, LEFT, LUMPECTOMY: INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED BY COMBINED HISTOLOGIC CRITERIA. MAXIMUM TUMOR DIMENSION = 2.0 CM. ASSOCIATED DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, NUCLEAR GRADE 2 WITH NECROSIS. SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR MICROCALCIFICATIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU AND THE INFILTRATING CARCINOMA COMPONENTS. ESTROGEN RECEPTOR: POSITIVE (80% nuclear staining) PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR: POSITIVE ( 9O% nuclear staining) (SEE COMMENT). AMMENDMENT 2: FOLLOWING INTRADEPARTMENTAL REVIEW, RESULTS OF HER2 STUDIES ARE REVISED. HER2 BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: WEAKLY POSITIVE (2+) HER2 BY FISH: NOT AMPLIFIED (1.1) COMMENT : Estrogen and progesterone receptors were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods. A positive test is defined as easily discernable nuclear staining in more than 5% of the tumor cells. The specimen was evaluated for HER-2/Neu (c-erbB2) overexpression by immunohistochemical methods (DAko Hercep Test). Staining is interpreted on a scale of 0 to 3+ with positivity defined as 2+ or greater.. Specimens with a weakly positive (2+) Hercep Test are further evaluated by.

L USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): fluorescence in situ hybridization (Pathvysion Fish assay) to detect. presence or absence of Her-2/neu gene amplification.. ** Report Electronically Signed Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: -year-old female with Tinomo infiltrating ductal carcinoma of left breast on physical exam and core biopsy. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE" consists of a 2.0~cm x 0.7 cm x 0.4 cm soft, tan tissue fragment. Bisected. 1cF B. LEFT BREAsT TIssuE received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFT BReAsr TIssuE" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, measuring 9.7 cm anterior to posterior, 6.8 cm medial to lateral, and 5.0 cm superior to inferior. The overlying ellipse of brown skin, with a 0.4 cm linear incision, measures 2.6 cm x 0.8 cm. Ink code: Red-lateral, yellow=medial, black-posterior, blue-superior, and green-inferior. The specimen is sectioned anterior to posterior revealing a 2.0 cm tumor, with well-defined margins and white, gritty cut surface, 0.4 cm from the. nearest margin superior. The remaining tissue is mostly fatty with a few patches of white fibrous tissue. One section of skin, one section of. grossly normal fibrous tissue, and two sections of tumor are submitted for the cBcp protocol (matching paraffin section=B1, B2, and B3-B4, respectively). Slide key: Bl: Representative skin. B2: Grossly normal fibrous tissue. B3-B4: Tumor. B5-B6: Anterior margin. B7: Representative fibrous tissue. B8-B9: Tumor. B10-B12: Section of B3. B13-B14: Representative sections. B15-B16: Section of B4. B17: Representative sections. B18-B22: Posterior margin. 22CF Page 2 End of Report FUK UFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
