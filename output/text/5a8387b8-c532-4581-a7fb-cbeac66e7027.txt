SPECIMEN RIGHT GLOBE ENUCLEATION, PROGNOSTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC CLINICAL DETAILS See diagram. Measurements 10.63 x 10.18 x (10.37)mm MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A fresh, intact, right globe. Dimensions: Axial 25mm, Horizontal 23.Smm, Vertical 24mm Cornea: Horizontal 12.5mm, Vertical 12mm Optic nerve: flesh On trans-illumination, a shadow is seen in the inferolateral position, approx 13mm. Plane of section: vertical Intraocular description: A solitary dome shaped, pigmented choroidal mass is seen. Prominent vessels arising from optic disc. IoL is present. Tumour size. LBD 12mm, Height 10.5mm MICROSCOPY Sections show a pigmented choroidal melanoma consisting predominantly of spindle cells. Tumour cells express Melan-A and HSp 27 (score 3). The number of mitosis is approximately 8/40 high power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, and closed loops are present in the planes of sections. The lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is minimal. Tumour necrosis is not seen. There is no tumour extension through the sclera, optic nerve or vortex veins examined. Tumour cells are not seen at the resection margins. IDO3 r'J s/3c/1y Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified:

A supplementary report will follow in due course. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT - MLPA In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed. using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLpA). These investigations were performed in the The kit P027 from , which examines for gains or. losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used.  and the quality assessed using multiplex-pcR prior to the MLPA The DnA concentration was high and of good quality on assessment. The MLpA reaction was run at least twice on differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLpA products is printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated: loss of chromosome 1p, monosomy 3, normal chromosome 6 and gains in chromosome 8.. Taken together. these molecular data would place the patient in the high risk group with respect to the development of metastatic melanoma. Consideration of clinical features of the tumour is,. however, also required. Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified: nary Tumor Site Prior Malig
