Tumor site: Upper lobe of left kidney. 3.Tumor focallty:Unifocal. 4.Tumor size:7.5 x 6.0 x 5.8 cm 5. Macroscopic extent of tumor: Neoplasm appears to be confined to the contents of the kldney.. 6. Microscopic extent of tumor: Neoplasm does not appear to invade through the renai capsule.. 7. Nuclear grade: Fuhurman grade 3/4. 8. Lymphovascular space invasion: No. 9. Sarcomatoid features: Absent. zcD6-3 Surgicat Margin.Status: 1. Margins are uninvolved by carcinoma 2. Ureteral margin: Negative. arenomc, pop llary : renal ce)! 3. Soft tissue margins: Negative. 8260|3 4. Vascular margins: Negative. Site: OKidney, Nos Lymph Node Status: 1. Total number of lymph nodes received: 1 (hilar). 2.Tatal number of lymph nodes containing metastatic carcinoma: 0. C64.9 Other: 9D 1215112 1. Other significant findings: Adrenal gland: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma. (see comment) Chronic pylonephritis.. 2. pTNM stage:T2a N0 M1. Electronic signature. COMMENTS: Sections of the adrenal giand demonstrate adrenal cortical hyperplasia with extensive hemorrhage and focal necrosis within the medullary component. A single nodule of clear cell proliferation which is well vascularized is noted and because of the histologic features immunohistochemical stains are. periormed with the following results: RCC: Positive. CDt0: Positive. Vimentin: Positive. Based on the immunohistochemical results and the H&E findings the features of the adrenal nodule are most consistent with those of metastatic rena! s carcinoma. This case has.been reviewed in intradepartmental consultation and as part of the Department's Quallty Review Program b!.. e in agreement with the diagnosis. CLINICALHISTORY: Preoperative Diagnosis: Abdominal mass unspecified site.. Postoperative Diagncsie: Symptoms/Radiologic Findings SPECIMENS: Left kidney and adrenal gland.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received labeled  measures 20 x 14 x 10 cm., weighs 1,045 grams. Thers is a portion of adrenal giand attached to the specimen as well as a detached piece of an. adrenal gland within the container. The adrenal gland together measures 4.5 x 2 x 2 cm. The cut surface is golden yellow with areas of hemorrhage.. The ureter measures 9.5 cm. in length, 0.3 cm. in diameter. The surface is gray to brown-tan. The ureter is opened. The mucosal surface is light tan. There is no material within the lumen or lesions identified. The renal artery measures 1.5 cm. in length, 0.5 cm. in diameter. it Is grossly unremarkable. The renal vein measures 1.5 cm. in diameter. Sectioning there is tumor visibla within the lumen, it is 0.6 cm. from the resected margin.. At the hllum there is a yellow-tan nodule measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm. possible lymph node. The soft tissue resection margin is yellow-tan slightly shaggy. The resected margin has been inked. The kidney is bisected and reveals a yellow to brown-tan variegated soft friable shaggy mass measuring 7.5 x 6 x 5.8 cm. within the upper pole that on sectoning is grossly confined to the capsule and does not show evidence of invasion into the perinephric fat. It comes within 0.1 cm. of the inked resected nargin. The mass does not invoive the surrounding renal calices pelvis. The calices, peivis are gray-tan.. The surrounding renal cortex is brown-tan and measures 0.5 cm. and shows a well demarcated corticomedullary junction. No other lesions are identified grossly.  Received with the specimen are three cassettes - one green, one yellow, one blue labeled. vith the yellow cassette additionally labeled.-. 16. The green cassette additionally labeled - 17; and the blue cassette additlonally labeled - 18. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes labeled -- Iolows: sections from mass in blocks 1 through 4; ureter block 5; rena!  artery and vein in block 6; surrounding uninvolved kidney in olock 7: possible hilar lymph node bisected in block 8; adrenai gland in block 9..
