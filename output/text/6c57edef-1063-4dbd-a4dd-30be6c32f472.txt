Total number examined: 33 Tumor deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue: Not Identified Tumor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition) : pT2 (Tunor invades muacularis propria) Lymph Node Stage (AJCc 7th Edition): NO (No regional lymph node metastasis) 2 PORTION OF OMENTUM, EXCISION: BENIGN MATURE ADIPOSE TISSUE. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. 1).The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon. The terminal ileum measuxes nine cm in length and five cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The xemaining. colon measures 24 in length. with a circumference of s.5 cm at the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measures six cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.  Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tigsue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to tive cm in thickness.. The specimen is opened to reveal a large gessile lesion measuring 6.5 cm in length, 10 cm in width, and to 2 cm in thickness. The mass is located in the cecum, eight cm from the proximal margin and 18 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning reveals probable invasion into the submucosa. There is queationable muscularis propria invasion and the tumor does not appear to' invade through the muaculazis propria. The depth of invasion ig 0.2 cm grossly.  The remaining mucosa is tan with normal folds. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and fox Tps. Summary of sections:.

Page 4 of 4 MSH6 : STAINING PRESENT IN TUMOR PMS2 : STAINING PRESENT IN TUMOR CONCLUSION: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING FOR THE TESTED DNA MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS IS RETAINED IN THE TUMOR. Some of the immunohistochemistry and Ish tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. Administration. The FoA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necesaary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.
