LEFT BREAST WITH AXILLARY CONTENTS INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS TPA/FSA-non sentinel lymph node #1: Touch prep is negative for tumor; frozen section positive for metastatic carcinoma (0.4 cm). Diagnosis called by Dr. to Dr GROSS DESCRIPTION:S A. NON-SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1  Received fresh, labeled with matching patient identifiers, are 2 lymph nodes, 1.1 x 1 x 0.5 cm (A2) and 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm (A1). A1 contains a 0.4 cm white area of discoloration. A2 is used for touch prep; A1 is submitted for frozen section. Specimen is submitted entirely. FSA1: frozen A1 A2: A2 B. RIGHT BREAST, NORMAL BREAST Received fresh, labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast, normal breast" is an oriented 1154 g. 27 x 17 x 7 cm mastectomy with 25 x 9.5 cm skin ellipse and 1.7-cm flat nipple. Ink code: Anterior/superior-blue,  anterior/inferior-orange, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned into 12 slices with from medial to iateral with nipple in slice 6; no masses or lesions are identified. No lymph nodes are found. Representatively submitted.

LEFT BRESAST WITH AXILLARY CONTENTS Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast with axillary contents" is an oriented 1457 g.  29 x 22 x 7 cm mastectomy with 24 x 11.5 cm skin ellipse and 1.2-cm inverted nipple; there is a 0.7-cm nodule adjacent to the nipple and multiple skin lesions ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 cm. Ink code: Anterior/superior-blue, anterior/inferior-orange, posterior-black.  Specimen is serially sectioned into 12 slices from medial to lateral with nipple and slice 6 revealing, in slices 5-7 a 2.5 x 2 x 1.8 cm firm tan lesion located in the mid upper region which is 3.2 cm from the deep margin and 1.7 cm from the anterior margin (#1), 2.4 cm inferior to lesion #1, in slice 8, is a 1.7 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm firm tan mass located in the mid section, 5 cm from the deep margin and 1 cm from the anterior margin (#2), 3 cm superior to lesion #2 is a firm 0.7 cm nodule located in the upper mid-quadrant in slice 8 which is 4.3 cm from the deep margin and 1.3 cm from the anterior margin. Clips are identified in slices 6, 7, and 8; multiple axillary lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections.. C1-C3: slice 6, lesion #1 including both margins (clip). C4: slice 7, connecting tissue between lesions #1 and #2 C5: slice 7, lesion #2 (clip) C6: slice 8, lesion #2 (clip) C7: slice 8, tissue connecting lesion #2 and #3 (including #3) C8: slice 11, upper outer quadrant C9: slice 10, upper outer quadrant C10: slice 10, lower outer quadrant C11: slice 4, lower inner quadrant C12: slice 3, lower inner quadrant C13-C15: nipple and adjacent nodule C16: skin lesions C17: 5 lymph nodes
