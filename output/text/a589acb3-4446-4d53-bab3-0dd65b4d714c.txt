SPECIMENS: A. RIGHT COLON SPECIMEN(S):  A. RIGHT COLON INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: A-right colon: Tumor is 11 cm from each margin (proximal and distal) called by GROSS DESCRIPTION:I A. RIGHT COLON Received fresh is a closed segment of colon including terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, cecum, and colon measuring 25 cm in length. The serosa has an area of tattooing approximately 7 cm from the distal margin. The vermiform appendix is 7.1 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width; it is unremarkable. On opening the colon, the segment of terminal ileum is 6 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter; right colon is 19 cm in length and up to 10 cm in diameter. The colon contains a circumferential, polypoid, indurated, mass with serpentine borders measuring 6 x 4.3 cm extending through the muscularis propria. The mass is located 11 cm from the proximal and distal margins and 5 cm from ileocecal valve. There are 2 colonic polyps, 0.5 and 0.6 cm. Tissue is procured. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1: proximal margin A2: distal margin A3-A8: mass in relationship with normal mucosal and deep margin A9: colonic polyps A10: normal-appearing mucosa including region of tattooing. A11: appendix A12: proximal, 6 lymph nodes A13: proximal, 2 lymph nodes A14-A15: proximal, 1 node each A16-A23: distal, 6 lymph nodes each A24-A25: distal, 3 lymph nodes each A26-A27: distal, 2 lymph nodes each A28-A33: distal, 1 lymph node each A34-A36: 7 possible lymph nodes each (after O-Fix) DIAGNOSIS: COLON, RIGHT, HEMICOLECTOMY:  INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED, ARISING IN A TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA.  TUMOR MEASURES 6 CM. - TUMOR INVOLVES THE SUBSEROSAL FAT. - MARGINS, FREE OF TUMOR - HYPERPLASTIC POLYPS (2). - APPENDIX, NO TUMOR SEEN. - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO TWO OF 65 LYMPH NODES WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION (2/65). SYNOPTIC REPORT - COLON & RECTUM Specimen Type:  Right hemicolectomy Tumor Site: Hepatic flexure Tumor Configuration: Infiltrative Ulcerating Tumor size: 6cm WHO Classification Adenocarcinoma 8140/3 Histologic Grade: G2: Moderately differentiated Extent of Invasion: Subserosa Margins: Margin(s) uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (Proximal, Distal, Radial) Venous/Lymphatic Invasion:  Present Perineural Invasion: Absent Additional Pathologic Findings: Adenoma Extent of Resection:  R0: Complete resection with grossly and microscopically negative margins
