I Patient: Case # FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGy REPORT Source of Specimen: Left Renal Mass Clinical History/Operative Dx: Left renal mass Gross Description. The specimen is designated as left renal mass. Initially received in the fresh state for possible tumor bank studies is a 5 gram portion of renal tissue, 2.7 x 2.3 x 1.8 cm. The renal surtace is raised, glistening, tense..  The surgical margin is now marked blue and the renal capsule is marked green. Sectioning demonstrates a well-circumscribed, glistening, somewhat fleshy. pink and tan lesion, 2 2 x 1.8 x 1.6 cm. Centrally, the lesion demonstrates a softened hemorrhagic appearance over an area 1.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. Representative  portions of grossly viable tumor is submitted for tumor bank studies. The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted for routine histology in A1-A4 Microscopic Description: The sections show an a thinly encapsulated neoplasm with central zone of hemorrhage. The neoplastic cells have abundant granular-eosinophilic cytoplasm, distinct perinuclear halos, occasional binucleation, foci with wrinkled nuclear membranes, and scant nuclear atypia (but with scattered small nucleoli). No Iymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen. While most of the margin is negative (microscopically free with a thin fibrous capsule)., there is focal involvement of the inked-cauterized margin. A panel of  immunostains shows the tumor to have strong expression of CK7 and CKa/18, and rare cells with. expression ot CD10 (but to be negative for: CD15/CD117/Vimentin), which together with the morphology is. consistent with a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma Case # Page 3 REPRINT:Orig.printing on Chromw phobe Criteria 1218
