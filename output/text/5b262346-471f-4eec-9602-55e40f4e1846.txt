Pathology Report The senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a gross and/or microscopic examination of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the rapid diagnos(es) related thereto. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in four parts, each labeled with the patient's. name and unit number. Part A, "left lobe liver wedge", consists of a 100.4-g liver wedge resection (9.0 x 7.2 x 4.2 cm) with a cauterized parenchyma1 resection margin (9.0 x 4.2 cm, inked blue).  On cut sectioning, there is a white/tan focally (approximately 10%) necrotic tumor (5.0 x 4,5 x 3.0 cm) that grossly abuts the liver capsule (inked black) and is located 1.0 cm to the parenchymal resection. margin. 'A representative section of the parenchymal resection margin is submitted as FsA.  A representative section of tumor and normal liver is submitted for tissue banking. Representative sections are submitted for histological examination. Micro A1: FSA remnant, 1 frag, Micro A2: Tumor, quick fix, 2 frags, Micro A3: Tumor and capsule and tumor and uninvolved liver parenchyma, 2 frags,. RSS. Micro A4: Uninvolved liver, 1 frag, Part B, "sigmoid colon", consists of an unoriented segment of colon (16.8 x 2.9. cm in diameter) with two stapled resection margins (4.9 cm and 3.6 cm, both inked black). The specimen is open to reveal a centrally ulcerated mass (5.0 x. 4.0 x 1.2 cm) with raised borders that is 5.0 cm to the 4.9 cm stapled resection margin, 7.0 cm from the 3.6 cm stapled resection margin, and 2.6 cm to the mesenteric resection margin (16.8 x 2.3 cm, inked orange).. There are. two tan/black tattoos (#1 5.0 x 2.5 cm and #2 4.0 x 3.5 cm). Tattoo #1 is located 2.6 cm to the 4.9 cm stapled resection margin and 1.2 cm from the ulcerated mass. Tattoo #2 is located 4.1 cm to the 3.6 cm stapled resection margin and 1.2 cm from the centrally ulcerated mass.  Tattoos #1 and #2 are located 7.2 cm from each other and are on opposite sides of the ulcerated mass. Underlying the tattoo #1 is a submucosal firm nodule (0.8 x 0.8 cm) that is located 0.8 cm from the 4.9 cm stapled resection margin and 4.0 cm to the ulcerated mass. Underlying tattoo #2 is a submucosal nodule (1.0 x 0.8 cm) located 6.1 cm to the 3.6 cm stapled resection margin and 2.5 cm from the ulcerated mass. There is an area of serosal puckering immediately deep to the centrally ulcerated mass (1.5 x 0.5 cm) that is located 4.0 cm from the mesenteric resection margin, 7.5 cm from the 4.9 cm stapled resection margin, and 7.0 cm from the 3.6 cm stapled resection margin. Gross photos are taken and representative sections are submitted for histological examination. Micro B1: 4.9 cm stapled resection margin to include 0.8 cm submucosal nodule; perpendicular, 1 frag, Micro B1: 3.6 cm stapled resection margin, perpendicular frag Micro B3: Remainder of 0.8 cm submucosal nodule, 1 frag, Micro B4: 1.0 cm submucosal nodule, 2 frags, Micro B5: Mesenteric resection margin, perpendicular, 1 frag, Micro B7: Tumor and adjacent uninvolved mucosa closest to 3.6 cm stapled resection margin, 1 frag, Micro B9: Tumor, 2 frags, Micro B10: ? matted lymph nodes (1.8 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm), bisected, 1 frag, Micro B11: Micro B12: Micro B13: 4 lymph node candidates, 4 frags, Micro B14-B17: Pericolonic adipose tissue, 1 frag each, Part C, "proximal donut", consists of a circular tan/pink soft tissue fragment (1.1 x 1.6 cm in diameter) that is 'attached to metallic anvil and contains a Page: 2 of 3
