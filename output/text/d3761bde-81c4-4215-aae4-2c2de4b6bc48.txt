GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received unfixed in seven parts. Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx and "left neck level 2-4". The specimen consists of a 9.0 x 4.0 x 2.2 cm selective neck dissection. The specimen is arbitrarily divided into 3 equal levels and potential lymph nodes are dissected out.. Level 2: 16 lymph nodes are dissected are ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. Level 3: 7 lymph nodes are dissected out ranging in size from 0.4 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 1.5 to 1.0 cm.

The lesion extends to within less than O.1-cm of the wall of an adjacent vessel. The remainder of the tissue consists of tan-brown, soft to firm muscle with adherent vessel and adipose tissue. Digital images are taken.. Section code: 2A-2C - lesion with vessel. 2D-2F - lymph nodes from level 2 2G, 2H - lymph nodes from level 3 2I - lymph nodes from level 4 2J - lymph nodes from level 5 Formalin exposure time: 28 hours Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx and "right thyroid". measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm and weighing 695 mg. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted on cut surface following frozen section consult in cassette labeled 3Afs. Formalin exposure time: 28 hours Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx and "left tongue base deep margin".  The specimen consists of a tan-pink, soft to firm. fragment of tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm. Following frozen section consult the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette labeled 4AFs..

Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx and "right tongue base deep margin". The specimen consists of a 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4-cm tan-gray, soft to firm portion of tissue. Following frozen section consult the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette labeled 5AFs.. Formalin exposure time: 28 hours Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx and "larynx and tongue". The specimen consists of a total thyroidectomy specimen measuring 11.0 x 7.5 x 2.8 cm overall with a 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm portion of base of There is a 4.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm portion of hyoid bone present. tongue. There is a 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm right thyroid lobectomy present weighing 6 g. There is a supraglottic 6.5 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm tan-gray, firm, fungating ulcerated lesion present at the base of tongue. The lesion extends to within 0.3 cm of the left base of tongue edge, 0.4 cm of the medial base of tongue edge, 0.3 cm of the right base of tongue edge. The lesion extends into the right pyriform sinus and comes to within 0.5 cm of the margin. The lesion also at the left pyriform sinus and comes to within 1 cm of the sinus margin. The lesion extends to within 0.5 cm of the right false cord and 1.0 cm of the left false The cord. The lesion comes within 5 cm of the distal tracheal margin.. lesion grossly extends through the muscle and comes to within 0.4 cm of the inked anterior soft tissue margin. The lesion comes to within 0.l-cm the. entire bone bed. The epiglottis is almost entirely obliterated by the lesion. The lesion grossly does not extend to either the right or left false cords and the cartilage is grossly uninvolved. The right false cord mucosa is. slightly granular with no lesion is grossly identified.. The vocal cords and remaining laryngeal mucosa is tan-gray, soft and grossly The right thyroid cut surface is tan-brown, soft and. unremarkable. firm and diffusely nodular with a tan-yellow, firm circumscribed nodule present..
