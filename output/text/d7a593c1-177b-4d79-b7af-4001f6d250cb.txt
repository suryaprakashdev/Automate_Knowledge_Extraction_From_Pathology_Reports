FInAl SuRgICAL pAthOLOgy REPOrt Tumor Staging Information. (data derived from current specimen, staging in accordance with or modified from AJCC Cancer Staging Handbook, 7th Ed, and CAP protocol RENAL PELVIS: Regional lymph nodes: No nodes submitted or found.. Procedure: Nephrectomy with partial ureterectomy.. Specimen laterality: Left. Tumor size: 3.7 x 3.2 x 3.2 cm (Most of which is non-invasive papillary carcinoma, with a few small foci of invasive carcinoma invading the lamina propria measuring up to 0.1 cm). Histologic type: Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma.. Associated epithelial lesions:. Background of non-invasive papillary urothelia! carcinoma, high-grade. Histologic grade:. High-grade. Tumor configuration: Papillary. Margins: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (closest margin is Gerota's fascia at 1 cm; tumor is 1.5 cm from renal hilar vascular margins).. Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified. PATHOLOGIC STAGING (no TNM descriptors): Primary tumor: pT1, tumor invades subepithelial connective tissue (lamina propria). Regional lymph nodes: pNX. Distant metastasis: pMX. Additional pathologic findings:. Urothelial carcinoma in situ (high-grade itraurothelial neoplasia). Inflammation/regenerative changes (patchy chronic interstitial nephritis).

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGy REPORT Source of Specimen:. Left Kidney and Left Ureter Clinical History/Operative Dx: Left renal pelvic tumor. Gross Description: The specimen is labeled left kidney and ureter and is received without fixative. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen with adherent long segment of ureter which weighs.  The nephrectomy specimen measures 14 cm from superior to inferior, 7.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior to posterior. There is no grossly identifiable adrenal gland tissue. Along the anterior surface of the kidney is a 8 x 5.5 cm area of thin delicate adherent tissue suggestive of Gerota's fascia. At the hilum the renal artery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intralumina! tumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney is a 26 cm segment of ureter which proximally and. centrally has a diameter of 0.5 cm, up to 0.6 cm at the distal end. A yellow plastic stent is present in the Jumen of the ureter. The ureter is opened and the urothelium is tan and smooth. At the pelvis friable. tumor is present in the renal pelvis arising from the central calix. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a finely granular tan-white neoplasm occupying the superior pole calix and extending into the middle pole calix. This neoplasm overall measures 3.7 x 3.2 x 3.2 cm. It is approximately 1 cm from Gerota's fascia and 1.5 cm from the renal hilar vascular margin. It involves the upper pole and central pole calices. The inferior pole calix appears uninvolved. The renal parenchyma is otherwise reddish brown and cortical thickness is 0.6 cm. There are no obvious lymph nodes in the perinephric adipose tissue. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2) Gerota's fascia, A3) distal ureter, A4) mid and proximal ureter, A5) ureteropelvic junction, A6-A8) sections of tumor, A9) tumor in renal pelvis, A10) uninvolved kidney..
