Page 2 of 3 1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right hemicolectomy" and consiots of a segment of texminal ileum, cecun with attached appendix and. ascending colon. The terminal ileum measures 24 om in length and 5 om in ciroumference at the proximal reseoted margin. The xemaining colon measures 29 cm in length with a cixcunference of 6 cm at the distal resected margin. The attaohed appendix meaaures 5 cm in length and averages 0.6 an in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal seroaa is pink tan and amooth. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tisaue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 4 cm in thickness. The aexosa is inked black. The specimen contains a fungating masa (5.5 cm in length and 3.5 dm in width) occupying the cedwn, surrounding the ileocecal valve with sparing of the appendical orifice. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades into the subserosa. The depth of Invasion is 3.5 cn grossly. The xemaining colonia. mucosa shows rare diverticula. The distal ileal mucosa shows occasional. diverticula and small mucosal polyps. The specimen is aubmitted fox Iymph. node disseotion. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for. pexmanent seations. Sumaxy of sections: p-. proximal maxgin shave. D -- diatal margin shave.

Site PC8 BLN 2 2 #1) SITE: LARGE BOWEL - IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING FOR DNA MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS HAS BEEN PERFORMED. THE RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: MLHI; STAINING PRESENT IN TUMOR MSH2 : STAINING PRESENT IN TOMOR MSH6: STAINING PRESENT IN TUMOR PMS2 1 STAINING PRESENT IN TOMOR CONCLUSION: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING FOR THE TESTED DNA MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS IS RETAINED IN THE TUMOR. Some of the immunohistochemlstry and Ish tests wexe developed and their performanca characteriatica were determined by the Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared ox appxoved by the us Food and Drug Administration. The rDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests.are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarde tigational or for xesoarch. Tbis laboxatoxy ie ceztified ag undex the qualified to pexform high complexity. ** End of Report **
