Frozen section control. "Base of tongue' A 0.0 cm tan soft tissue fragment. Frozen section control. "Total laryngectomy wide field laryngectomy" Received in formalin in a medium container is an 8.3 x 5.9 x 5.1 cm laryngectomy with attached anterior strap muscles. The right pyriform mucosa is inked green and the left side is. inked blue. The previously opened larynx has an ulcerating 1.6 x 1 cm tumor which involves the right supraglottic mucosa, comes to within 1.5 cm of the right pyriform mucosal margin and 1.2 cm from the edematous right vocal cord. The ulcerating tumor also comes to within 4.8 cm of the tracheal margin. The cut surface into this ulcerating tumor shows diffuse submucosal penetration, enlarging the greatest dimension of this tumor to 2.7 cm. The maximum thickness is 1.8 cm, and it comes to within less than 0.1 cm of the thyroid cartilage and also within 0.1 cm of the hyoid bone. The gray-white, focally hyperemic tumor penetrates under the epiglottis and the anterior strap muscle The tumor does not appear to extend to the left vocal cord, commissure or pyriform sinus. The right true vocal fold has an ill-defined, black area that appears to be 0.7 cm in greatest dimensions. No other mass nor lesion is readily seen. 8A. Right mucosal margin. 8B.
