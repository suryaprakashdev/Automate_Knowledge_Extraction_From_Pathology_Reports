Post-op Dx: Same GROSS EXAMINATION: A: The specimen is received fresh from the o.R. and labeled "Right distal ureter". It consists of a segment of ureter measuring 0.2 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in AFs. B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Lt. distal ureter". It consists of a segment of ureter measuring 0.2 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in BFs. C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Margin #2 left ureter". ~It consists of a segment of ureter measuring 1 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter.  The specimen is oriented by the surgeon and the club is both at the distal end.  The distal end is kept for permanent and the proximal margin is submitted for frozen section in cFs, and the remaining tissue is submitted in one cassette. D:  The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Apical urethral margin-f/s. It consists of red-tan soft tissue fragment measuring 2.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in DFs. E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Bladder/prostate". It consists of a radical prostatectomy specimen weighing 422 grams and measuring overall 25 x 12 x 6 cm. The peritoneum measures 19 x 15 x 0.1 cm. It is yellow-pink smooth glistening and unremarkable.  The prostate and the lower bladder are entirely inked black. Red ink is superimposed on the right side of prostate. The prostate measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 4 cm. Opening the prostate anteriorly reveals the prostatic urethra to measure 4 cm in length x 3 cm in circumference without excavation.  The verumontanum measures 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm and is unremarkable. The bladder itself measures 6 x 5 x 4 cm.  Opening the bladder anteriorly shows an exophytic tumor on the left lateral wall which measures 5.5 x 5 x 4 cm. The tumor extends grossly through the muscle and abut the inked peritoneal margin. The tumor comes within 0.2 cm from the left ureterovesical junction. The attached right
