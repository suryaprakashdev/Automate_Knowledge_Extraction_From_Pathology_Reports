UUID:D64FFDC0-388B-456E-9621-AF8937900C68 tcga-a7-a13F-01a-pr Redacted SPECIMEN A. Sentinel lymph node #l, right axilla, count 422 B. Sentinel node #2, right axilla, count 2600 C. Left breast tissue, single stitch - superior, double stitch - medial D.  Right breast ((dc) ics-g.? CLINICAL NOTES Ca^rirona. d.fiinntiny Dust, ros. PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Right breast Ca 1500/3 FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS Sitx. brsst, Nos c5o.9. +/u.. A. Sentinel node 1, right axillary: No tumor seen. No definite lymph node. B. Sentinel node II right axillary, biopsy: two lymph nodes, both positive for metatatic carcinoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "sentinel node #l right axilla" and consists of a 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. piece of fatty yellow tissue. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a possible 0.6 cm. tan lymph node. No staining is present. The possible lymph node tissue is frozen as frozen section AFsl. The fatty tissue is entirely submitted in block 1 for permanent sections.. B. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "B. sentinel node #2 right axilla" is a 6.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. piece of soft yellow fatty tissue. The specimen is palpated and sectioned to reveal two possible lymph nodes. One measures 1.5 cm. in greatest dimension and has a focally firm white-tan appearance. The other measures 1.0 cm. in greatest dimension and appears tan and soft. The larger lymph node is frozen as frozen section BFsl and the smaller as frozen section BFs2. Both lymph nodes are bisected. GROSS DESCRIPTION C. The specimen is received in formalin labeled "left breast tissue" and consists of a V-shaped piece of white skin with underlying yellow soft tissue, two additional pieces of yellow soft tissue and an additional piece of white skin. The entire specimen weighs 480 grams in the partially fixed state. On cut section the breast tissue is unremarkable. RS-8 D. The specimen is received in formalin labeled "right breast" and consists of a right breast resection specimen measuring 35 x 21 x 6 cm. There is an overlying white ellipse of skin measuring 21 x 9 cm. The skin ellipse has a central areola measuring 4.5 x 4 cm. with a central nipple measuring 1.3 x 1 x 0.2 cm. An arrow has been incised in the skin ellipse. The deep surface of the specimen has been inked and the breast has been partially

sectioned prior to my examination. There is a deep central tumor a portion of which has been resected prior to my examination,. probably for research purposes. The tumor measures 6 x 4 x 7 cm. The specimen is re-incised at 1 cm. intervals from the deep surface towards the skin. Sections are taken as dictated in the block summary:. BLOck suMMARy: 1 and 2 - nipple; 3 - deep margin; 4-7 - tumor; 8- 11 -- upper outer, upper inner, lower outer, lower inner quadrants.. Sections from the axillary portion of the specimen show 1i lymph node-like structures. These are submitted in blocks D12-Dl7. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A. Fibrofatty connective tissue is present. The specimen is negative for malignancy.. B. Metastatic carcinoma is present in 2 of 2 lymph nodes. The. largest nodules measure 0.2 and 0.5 cm..  There is focal benign calcification.. D. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Invasive carcinoma Tumor type: Infiltrating ductal caricnoma with focal. lobular features Tumor grade: 2 (Elston SBR grade; A/N/M = 3/2/1) Mitotic index: 4 mitoses/10 HPFs (l HPF = 0.196 sq mm) Tumor size: 4 x 6 x 7 cm Vessel invasion: Carcinoma is present in lymphatics in the nipple. Calcification: Absent pTNM stage: T3 pNla Prognostic markers: See previous biopsy Nipple: Carcinoma is present in lymphatics in the nipple Skin over tumor: Negative for malignancy Deep margin: Negative for malignancy Total lymph nodes: 11 (including 2 sentinel nodes). Lymph nodes positive: 3 (including 2 sentinel nodes) Size of metastases: Up to 3.5 mm Extranodal tumor: Absent Matted lymph nodes:. Absent 4x2,3,5,14x2,15
