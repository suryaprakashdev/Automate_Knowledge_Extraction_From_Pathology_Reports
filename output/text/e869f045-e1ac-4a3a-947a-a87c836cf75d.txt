UUID:CA6B733A-6030-422C-9DE9-B9718C382FDC TCGA-GM-A2DF-01A-PR Redacted GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) ADDITIONAL MARGIN OF MOST MEDIAL TUMOR - Received is a piece of fibroadipose tissue (1.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm) with clips on the true margin. The true margin inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in A. (B) LEFT SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY - A segmental mastectomy specimen (8.0 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm) with a short stitch at the superior aspect, long stitch at the lateral aspect, and multiple clips on the anterior aspect. The specimen is serially sliced from medial to lateral into 11 slices. A well-circumscribed tan-pink tumor 1.4 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm, with an associated biopsy clip is identified in

slice #3, which is 0.7 cm from the closest anterior margin. Multiple smaller nodules are identified Iateral to the main tumor. One of these is very close to the anterior margin in the central anterior inferior aspect of the specimen, and additional tissue is requested from this margin. INK CODE: Anterior - yellow, posterior - black, superior - blue, inferior - green, medial and lateral - red. SECTION CODE: B1, medial perpendicular margin; B2, tissue adjacent to tumor from slice #2 ; B3-B7, tumor and margins trom slice #3 (B3 and B4, tumor with anterior margin in area of clip; B5, inferior margin; B6, posterior margin; B7, superior margin); B8, tibrous tissue adjacent to the tumor from slice #4; 89, one small nodule, 1.2 cm from superior margin and 1.8 from anterior margin of slice #4; B10, one small nodule 1.0 cm trom anterior margin and 1.2 cm from superior margin of slice #5; B11, one small nodule, 1.5 cm from anterior margin, 2.0 cm from superior margin ot slice #5; B12, B13, one small nodule, 0.1 cm from anterior margin and 1.2 cm from inferior margin of slices #6 and #7; B14, one small nodule 0.4 cm from posterior margin and 1.5 cm from inferior margin of slice #4; B15-B18, remainder of margins of slice #4, entirely. submitted (B15, anterior margin; B16, superior margin; B17, posterior margin; B18, inferior margin); B19, representative section from slice #8; B20, lateral perpendicular margin. (C) ADDITIONAL CENTRAL ANTERIOR INFERIOR MARGIN, LEFT BREAST - A portion of tibroadipose tissue (2.0 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm) with clips on the true margin. The true marain is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in C1-C2. (D) LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS - Adipose tissue (11.0 x 7.5 x 3.0 cm). Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.

Immunohistochemical staining is performed on a representative tormalin-tixed, paraffin- embedded section of INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, left breast, block B3. % POSITIVE SCORE MARKER RESULTS  Negative 0 % n/A Estrogen Receptor Negative < 1 % N/A Progesterone Receptor HER-2/neu Negative Focal 1+ overexpression Due to the above HER-2/neu immunohistochemical staining result, gene copy level (heR-2/neu: cEp17 signal ratio) will be evaluated by FIsH and'a separate report will be issued. FOOTNOTE Estrogen receptor was assessed by immunohistochemistry using antibody 6F11 ( Progesterone receptor was assessed by immunohistochemistry using antibody PgR1294( HER-2/neu was assessed by immunohistochemistry using antibody AB8 (l Released by: Start of ADDENDUM #2 ADDENDUM #2 This moditied report is being issued to report the results of HER-2/neu FISH Addendum completed by SPECIMEN SOURCE Left breast  SUMMARY Tissue section of the invasive carcinoma B3 was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the " HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu !CEP17 Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57 copies ot LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies ot CEP17 per nucleus.

I with this batch are Negative and positive controls (established by appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu. CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12 ) The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing:. Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 -- 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu levels: > 2.20 (Ret: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43) NOTES The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specitic for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP 17 DNA probe is specitic for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1 -q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved tor specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration. Its system is operating within the performance specifications stated in the product. insert.
