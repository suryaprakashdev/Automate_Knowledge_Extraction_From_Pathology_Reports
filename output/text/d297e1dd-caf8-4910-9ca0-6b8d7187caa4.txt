SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "prostate", and consists of a piece of tan soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis. Summary of sections: FSC - frozen section control 2. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "anterior rectal mass", and consists of muitiple pieces of tan soft tissue ranging from 0.3.  to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The larger piece is bisected, and the specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis. Summary of sections:. FSC - frozen section control 3. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "right pelvic lymph node", and consists of multiple pink tan fatty lymph nodes with attached fatty fibrous tissue ranging from 0.2 cm to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. Cut section reveals that the largest lymph node is. grossly positive. All additional identified lymph nodes are entirely submitted. Summary of sections: GPLN - grossly positive lymph node LN-lymph nodes BLN-bisected lymph nodes 4. The specimen is received in formalin labeled "left pelvic lymph node", and consists of multiple pink tan fatty lymph nodes with  attached fatty fibrous tissue ranging from 0.4 cm to 4.2 cm in greatest dimension. All identified lymph nodes are submitted.. Summary of sections: LN - lymph nodes BLN - bisected lymph nodes LN1 - half of largest lymph node  ADD - remaining half of largest lymph node 5. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "bladder, prostate, urethra, urachus, seminal vesicles and perivesical tissue and lymph nodes". It consists of a bladder with attached prostate and seminal vesicles measuring 17.0 cm from superior to inferior, 11.5 cm. from medial to lateral, and 7.2 cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder measures 7.5 x 6.5 x 3.5 cm and the prostate measures. 4.6 x 4.2 x 4.0 cm. The right half of the bladder and prostate is inked green; the left half of the bladder and prostate is inked blue. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted en face. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal a tan-yellow friable papillary centrally necrotic tumor involving predominately the left posterior and left lateral wall extending down the trigone measuring 6.1 x 4.5 x 1.8 cm.  The friable tissue partially occludes the leff ureteral orifice and grossly approaches the right ureteral orifice.  The tumor extends into the prostatic parenchyma and lies 3.6 cm from the prostatic urethral margin. The tumor is sectioned to reveal gross extension through the bladder wall into the perivesical fat. A full face section is taken, bisected, and submitted accordingly. The tumor also approaches the anterior soft tissue margin, and grossly invades the seminal vesicles bilaterally.  There is an additional ulcerated lesion in the dome of bladder that measures 2.2 x 1.8cm and lies 1.8 cm from the trigone, 2.5 cm from the right ureteral orifice, and 3.2 cm from the left ureteral orifice. The remaining bladder mucosa is dusky and. congested. TPs from both ulcerated tumor foci are submitted. Representative sections are submitted for routine processing. Summary of sections: UTHM - urethral margin RUM - right ureter margin LUM - left ureter margin TAM - tumor to anterior soft tissue margin TP - tumor to posterior soft tissue margin TPR - tumor to prostate TU - tumor to prostatic urethra TF - tumor to fat (full face section) TU - tumor to urethra UD - ulcerated defect within the dome RUO - right ureter orifice LUO - left ureter orifice to left ureter (bisected) LU - remaining left ureter Page 4 of 7
