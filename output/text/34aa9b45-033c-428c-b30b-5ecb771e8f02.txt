ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2.. Methodoloqy: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin ( ) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology:  Mouse anti-human ER and PR, Comment: This assay can be used to select invasive oreast cancer patients for hormone therapy (1). ER and PR analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) antibody provided by , following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not moditied, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical staining. characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (1), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department.. 1.

Block Number: A1 Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL Intensity: 2+ % Tumor Staining: 10% Fish Ordered: Yes , on Date METHODOLOGY Methodoloav: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin ( ) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2, HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit), Control Slides Examined: External kit-slides provided by manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression), and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma identified for. HER2 evaluation.. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System:. IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern Negative (0)/Absence of Staining. Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective

response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department.. HER2 TEST VALIDATION This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified.. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE 1.

PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FiSH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the . A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used A1. Source of case: RPCI Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No:NA Tissue sourcee breastResults interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.11 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration:  manual count Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free and overall survival in stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.
