focal chondrous metaplasia. AJCC Staging: pTla pNx pMx This staging information is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Clinical History: with a bilateral renal mass. Gross Description: Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: nephrectomy, unspecified Side of specimen: right Size and weight of specimen: 950 grams; The specimen in its entirety is 24 x15 x 6.5 cm.The kidney is 11.5 x7 x7 cm. Orientation: The superficial surface surrounding the tumor is inked blue. Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent Tumor description/site: There are multiple cortical tumor nodules. The largest is superior and midline. There are three other smaller tumor nodules scattered about the renal cortex. These nodules are mostly superior. Tumor size: There are multiple tumor nodules present, the largest measures 4 x 3.8 x 3.0 cm.The second largest measures 3.5x 2.8 x2.0 cm. Multiple smaller nodules are also found. These are scattered throughout the renal parenchyma. Presence/absence of multicentricity: present, at least 6 Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: Extending through the renal capsule.

Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: tumor grossly involves Gerotas fascia: not present Renal vein: does not involve Ureter: does not involve Other organs: n/a Surgical margins: Perirenal adipose tissue: positive Renal vein: negative Renal artery: negative Ureter: negative Description of kidney away from tumor: The kidney is pink/brown. There is a distinct corticomedullary junction. The cortex measures approximately 0.9 cm while the medulla measures approximately1.2 cm.
