Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS (A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND: CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3. (SEE COMMENT) TUMOR CONFINED TO KIDNEY. TUMOR MEASURES 5.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. Vascular, ureteral and soft tissue margins of resection, free of tumor. COMMENT The immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the tumor is focally positive for cytokeratin 7 and CD10 and negative for. vimentin. The electron microscopic examination demonstrates that the tumor is made of large polygonal cells with abundant cytoplasm containing numerous microvesicles and a moderate number of mitochondria with tubular cristae. The immunohistochemical profile and ultrastructural features of the tumor support the diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. The entire perinephric adipose tissue in the upper pole of the kidney is submitted for histological examination and no adrenal gland. is identified. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A nephrectomy specimen including kidney (12.0 x 7.0 x 4.0 cm), a portion of ureter (12.0 cm long and 0.5 cm in circumference) with attached perirenal fat. No adrenal gland is identified. A 5.5 x 4.8 x 4.0 cm, solid, circumscribed tumor is located in the upper pole of the kidney. The tumor is well circumscribed and grossly confined to the renal capsule. The tumor is close to the renal sinus but renal sinuses grossly not involved. The tumor has a. yellow-brown, variegated, solid cut surface. There is a 5.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm portion of fibroadipose tissue attached to the upper pole of the kidney. The fibrofatty tissue attached to the upper pole is serially sectioned and no adrenal gland tissue identified. INK CODE: black - Perirenal fat and fascia.
