SURGICAL PATHOL Report Right total mastectomy with axillary node dissection and sentinel node biopsy Pre Operative Dlagnosis:. Breast ductal carcinoma Specimen(s) Recelved: A: Sentinel node #1 count B: Sentinel node #2 count 1,FS C: Right total mastectomy. Gross Description: A. Received fresh is a segment of tan-brown fibroadipose tlssue, 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm.The specimen is bisected and submitted in toto in two blocks.. B. Received in formalin is a segment of tan-gray soft tissue, 1 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in toto in one block. C. Received in formalin is a 447-gram, 18 x 17.5 x 2 cm right mastectomy specimen. There is an ellipse of pale skin, 14.2 x 6.1 cm. The nipple/areola complex measures 2.5 x 2 cm. The nipple is retracted. The attached axillary tail measures 11.5 x 6.5 cm. The specimen is oriented with short stitch superior, two long stitches lateral. The resection margins are inked black. On serial sectioning, there is a tan-white, indurated, ill-defined lesion with infiltrating borders in the retroareolar space. it occupies the central compartment and measures 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. It is located 2 cm from the deep  margin, 7.5 cm from the inferior margin, 5 cm from the superior margin, 7 cm from the medial margin, and 9 cm from the  Iateral margin. No addltlonal lesions are identified. Examination of the axillary tail reveals multiple possib!e. lymph nodes.. Sections are submitted as follows: 1 Nipple 2 Deep margin (closest) 3-9 Lesion submitted in toto 10-12 One lymph node per block 13&14 Three lymph nodes per block. f+x/n Page 3 of 3
