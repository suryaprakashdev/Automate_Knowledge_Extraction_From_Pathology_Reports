WLE LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. WLE RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOC. Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and 'wLE right breast needle loc" is an oriented (short/1 clip- superior, long/2 clips-lateral, air knot-anterior) needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: Anterior-  yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned  from lateral to medial into 8 slices revealing a 2.4 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm firm tan stellate mass that is closest to the superior margin at 0.2 cm. Tissue is procured. Representatively submitted:.

A22: medial margin, perpendicular sections B. ADDITIONAL MARGIN RIGHT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "additional margin right breast" is in a oriented (short- superior, long-lateral) 11 g. 0.2 x 3.4 x 1.1 cm fibrofatty tissue. Margins are inked black. Serial sectioning reveals no discrete lesions. Inked margin submitted entirely in cassettes B1-B7.. NOTE: specimen was received with only 1 suture. C. WLE LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Received fresh labeled with patient's identification and *WLE left breast needle localization' is an oriented (shor/1 clip-superior, long/2 clips-lateral, loop-anterior) 42 g, 4 x 4 x 3.5 cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. Specimen is  serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 6 slices revealing a 2.4 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm firm tan stellate mass that is closest to the superior margin at 0.1 cm. Tissue is procured. Representatively submitted:.

BREAST, RIGHT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - iNVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 2.4-CM  - INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM TYPES WITH CENTRAL NECROSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS - INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT WITHIN 1-MM FROM SUPERIOR/MEDIAL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN - LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU  - BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE B. BREAST, RIGHT, ADDITIONAL SUPERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA INVOLVES NEW INKED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN, SEE NOTE. C. BREAST. LEFT. WIDE LOCAL EXCISION - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 1.8-CM - SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR - LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITUE - BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT. NOTE: Part B. was designated as superior by Dr. Therefore, invasive tumor is present at superior (part B) and within 1-mm from medial (part A) surgical resection margin.. E-cadherin is negative in LCIS component.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST Specimen Type: Excision Needle Localization: Yes Laterality: Left Invasive Tumof.- Present Multifocality:  No WHO CLASSIFICATION  Invasive ductal carcinoma, NOs 8500/3. Tumor size: 1.8cm Margins: Negative Distance from closest margin: 0.3cm superior Tubular Score: 2 Nuclear Grade: 2 Mitotic Score: 2 Modified Scarff Bloom Richardson Grade:. 2 Necrosis: Absent Vascular/Lymphatic Invasion: None identified Lobular neoplasia: LCIS Lymph nodes: No lymph node sampling. DCIS not present ER/PR/HER2 Results ER: Positive PR: Positive HER2: Negative by FISH Performed on Case: Pathological staging (pTN): pT 1c N x Pathological staging is based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition CLINICAL HISTORY:  female found with left breast lump. She had bilateral mammogram done showing bilateral breast masses. Bilateral core needle biopsies done on  showed bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma., Bilateral  needle localization scheduled and no sentinel lymph nodes will'be taken as her axilta are clintcatly negative and it would not change post op management she will likely received radiation and endocrine therapy.
