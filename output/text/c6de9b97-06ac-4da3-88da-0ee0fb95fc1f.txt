path report Microscopic Sections designated as "parietal tumor or parietal pericystic" demonstrate infiltrating or mildly cellular diffuse glioma. The tumor cells are characterized by round nuclei that lack obvious processes and perinuclear halos. The sections that are designated as arising inone of two cysts show markedly hypercellular tumor with essentially identical histologic features. They do have modestly greater hyperchromasia but this may reflect cell density. Only rare mitotic figures are seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis. Addendum MIB-1 reactivity varies significantly within the tumor. It ranges from 0.7% in the least proliferative areas up to 9.7%. Whereas this is worrisome for early anaplastic progression, the diagnosis f grade Ill anaplastic oligodendroglioma cannot be made on this alone. Diagnosis Oligodendroglioma, grade II.
