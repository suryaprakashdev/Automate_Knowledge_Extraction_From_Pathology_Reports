FINAL DIAGNOSIS: KIdney and adrenal Gland, Left, radical nephrectomy- KIDNEY: A. REnal CElL CaRcinOma, CLEar (convenTional) CeLl Type, fUrman GraDe 3-4 (3.2 Cm) (see comment). B. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA. C. RENAL VEIN IS FREE OF CARCINOMA. THE CARCINOMA DOES NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE RENAL CAPSULE. E. TNM staging = pT1a Nx Mx. ADRENAL GLAND: A. ADRENALCORTICALADENOMA,3.5 x 2.8 CM (see comment) NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY. COMMENT: The following immunohistochemical stains were performed on a section of the renal tumor (slide D), and the adrena cortical adenoma (slide I), with the following results; Vimentin; negative in kidney, negative in adrenal Cytokeratin CAM 5.2; positive in kidney, negative in adrenal Cytokeratin AE1/AE3; positive in kidney, negative in adrenal EmA; positive in kidney, negative in adrenal Inhibin; negative in kidney, positive in adrena!  Melan-A; negative in kidney, positive in adrenal CD-10; positive in kidney, positive in adrenal CD-34; negative in kidney, negative in adrenal (positive in background vessels in both). The above immunohistochemical profile confirms these two neoplasms to be separate, i.e. the adrenal mass is not a metastasis of the renal cell carcinoma.
