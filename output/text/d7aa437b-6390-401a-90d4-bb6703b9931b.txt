Tumor Size: Greatest dimension: 3.2 cm Tumor thickness: 1.5 cm. Histologic Grade: G3: Poorly differentiated. Venous/Lymphatic (Large/Small Vessel) Invasion (V/L): Absent Perineural Invasion: Absent Additional Pathologic Findings: Epithelial dysplasia Margins: Margins uninvolved by tumor - Distance of tumor from closest margin: 0.3 cm Margins: lateral and deep margins Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT2: Tumor of lip or oral cavity more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension pNX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed for aerodigestive sites. pMX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed. Comment The specimen is received in two parts. There is a polypoid lesion, which is made up of spindled and epithelioid dyscohesive cells that show a high mitotic activity and pleomorphism, consistent. with high-grade spindle cell neoplasm. Foci within this polyp also show typical squamous cell carcinoma. The second specimen is made up of a large area of squamous dysplasia with early invasive conventional squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated. The conventional squamous cell carcinoma is seen within 0.3 cm of the lateral and deep margins. The sarcomatoid. carcinoma component is largely confined to the exophytic polyp and is not seen near the margins.. The tumor thickness of the early invasive component is 0.3 cm, however the total thickness taking into account the polypoid lesion is 1.5 cm. Clinical History oral tongue cancer Gross Description 1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as " Oral cavity: rt tongue lesion'. It consists of an unoriented piece of oval, tan, firm mass with smooth surface, measuring 2.8 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. On cut surface, tumor is tan white and homogenous. There is a pedicle measuring O.5 x 0.5 cm. Specimen was cut by for tumor bank and not painted. Specimen is submitted in toto in blocks 1A through 1E. 2. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "Rt glossectomy (stitch=anterior)". It consists of a portion of tongue measuring 4.6 x 3.2 x 2.3 cm. There is a stitch on the anterior margin. There is a tumor involving the lateral surface of the tongue. It is grey white in colour, hard in consistency, and has a dull surface. There is a small ulcerated area (? area of pedicle), which is 0.4 cm away from anterior margin and measures 0.5 x 0.5cm. The tumor measures 3.2 (AP) x 2.0 cm (Sl) x 0.3 cm (ML/ deep). The tumor is 0.3 cm away from superior, 0.5 cm away from inferior, 0.4 cm away from anterior, 1.0 cm away from posterior, and 1.5 cm away from medial margin. Specimen is painted with silver nitrate and marked with green ink on supero- medial aspect. Representative sections are submitted. 2A- Anterior margin (perpendicular) with tumor 2B- posterior margin (perpendicular) with tumor. 2C- full thickness tumor with superior, medial, and inferior margins
