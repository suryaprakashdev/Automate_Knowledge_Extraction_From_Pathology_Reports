Surgical Pathology Report The tumor is present 1 mm from deep margin in multiple foci at main specimen, and focally in slice 1K is present at.  posterior/superior margin; final deep margin (specimen #3) negative.. 88307 X 2, 88305 Clinical Diagnosis and History: Left breast Ca + LN met) cT2; cN1: Clinical Stage IIB Tissue(s) Submitted:. 1: LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS 2: LEFT BREAST CANCER @ 2:00 (SUTURE MARKS ANTERIOR)E 3: LEFT BREAST TRUE DEEP MARGIN Gross Description: Specimen #1 is received fresh, subsequently placed in formalin labeled left axillary content and consists of a 10 x 8.5 x 3 cm  aggregate of adipose tissue which is palpated to reveal multiple indurated lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 3.7 cm in greatest  dimension. A representative section of each node is submitted as follows: 1A-1B-  each cassette containing a representative section of each of four grossly positive nodes. 1C- four halves of grossly four positive nodes 1D-1E-  each cassette containing half of two grossly positive nodes 1F- three representative sections of three grossly positive nodes. 1G- four representative sections of four grossly positive nodes. Additional sections are submitted as follows:. 1H-  remaining node corresponding to negative node in slide 1B. 11-  remaining nodes corresponding to fibrotatty tissue in slide 1A. Specimen #2 is received in formalin labeled left breast cancer at 2 o'clock (suture marks anterior) and consists of an oriented portion of fibrofatty tissue measuring 10 cm from medial to lateral, 7 cm from superior to inferior and 2.7 cm from anterior to posterior. Loosely received outside ot the tissue is a localization wire. The specimen is radiographed to document the loose Iocalization wire, a mass and a clip. The tissue is inked per protocol such that the superior is blue, the anterior is green, the medial is red, the lateral is yellow, the anterior is orange, and the posterior is black. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 9 slices to reveal a 2.4 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm indurated gray-white stellate mass in slices #4-8, grossly coming to within 0.5 cm of the posterior and superior margin, information relayed to the surgeon intraoperatively. The remaining cut surfaces are made up of approximately 10% dense tibrous tissue. Note the tissue is triaged per  protocol. Representative sections, concentrating on the closest margins, are. submitted as follows: 2A-2B-  representative perpendicular sections with lateral margin 2C- middle tibrous tissue from slice #2 2D- middle tibrous tissue from slice #3 2E- posterior margin with tumor slice #4 2F- superior posterior margin from slice #4. 2G- anterior margin with tumor slice #5 2H- anterior inferior margin slice #5 21-  superior posterior margin with tumor slice #5. 2J-2K- bisected section of posterior superior margin with tumor slice #6 2L- anterior inferior margin with tumor slice #6 2M- interior margin with tumor slice #7 2N- posterior margin with tumor slice #7 20-  superior margin with tumor slice #7 2P-2R-  representative medial margin. Additional sections are submitted as follows:. 2S-2T- tumor slice 8, no real margins, ink run over.  2U-2BB-remaining superior half of medial margin (true margin over-inked red Page 2 of 3

Surgical Pathology Report TIF: approximately  Specimen #3 is received fresh for orientation labeled left breast true deep margin and consists of an oriented portion of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6 x 5 cm from medial to lateral, 3.5 cxm from superior to inferior and 0.4 cm from anterior to posterior. The true  margin is inked per protocol such that the center is black, the superior edge is blue, the inferior edge is green, lateral edge yellow  and the medial edge is red. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 12 slices to reveal focally dense fibrosis. No tumor is palpated or grossly identified. The specimen is submitted entirely labeled 3A-3K at approximately. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis 2A 2.4CM GROSS TUMOR WITH NEGATIVE MARGINS, POSTERIOR CLOSEST.
