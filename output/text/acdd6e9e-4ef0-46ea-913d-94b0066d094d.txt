Page 2 of 4 Not Identified. Non-Neoplastic Bowel: Unremarkable Lymph Nodes: Total number examined: 17 consistent with prostatic origin, see comment Tumor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition) : pT2 (Tumor invades muscularis propria) Lymph Node Stage (AJcc 7th Edition): N0 (No regional lymph node metastasis) Comment: Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells in the lymph node are positive for PSA, while negative for CK7, Ck2o, CDx-2, TTF-1, chromogranin, and synaptophysin, consistent with a prostate origin. 2. Colon, distal ring; excision: -Benign colonic tissue with hyperplastic changes. Colon, proximal ring; excision: 3 -Benign colonic tissue. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment RECUT Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "sigmoid colon". It consists of an unoriented segment of sigmoid colon that measures 26 x 6 cm. The serosal surface is unremarkable. The radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a polypoid tumor that is located 2.4 cm from one margin and 21 cm from the opposite margin. The tumor measures 2.5 cm in length and 2 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals that the tumor maximum thickness is 1.5 cm. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. Pericolic adipose tissue spans the entire length of the specimen with a maximum thickness of 12 cm. It is submitted for lymph node dissection and thoroughly examined for lymph nodes,  and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. Tps is submitted. ** Continued on next page **
