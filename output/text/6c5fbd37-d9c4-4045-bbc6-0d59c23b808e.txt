Sib & Chersid cb93 CLINICAL DETAILSS V1117/14 Tumour size: 16.24 x 10.81 x 14.79mm History of blurred vision. Visual field defect. Pain since 6 months. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A fresh, intact right globe. Dimensions: Axial 25mm, Horizontal 24.5mm, Vertical 24mm Cornea: Horizontal 11.5mm, Vertical 11mm Optic nerve Length 12.5mm, Diameter 4mm Pupil: regular On trans-illumination, a shadow is seen in the supero medial measuring 19mun in maximum diameter. Plane of section: vertical oblique Intraocular description: On opening, a nodular, pale mass is seen, slightly anterior to the equator.. Tumour size LBD 9mm, Height 8.5mm MICROSCOPY Sections show a virtually non-pigmented choroidal melanoma extending from the ora serrata'/ pars plana up to the. equator. Tumour consists predominantly of spindle cells. The number of mitosis is approximately 4/40 high power fields. Closed loops are focaliy present in the planes of sections. The lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is minimal.. Tumour necrosis is not seen. There is no tumour extension Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified:

Tumour cells are not seen at the resection margins. Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is shallow. The iris shows no significant abnormality. ciliary processes away from tumour show slight hyalinisation. Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic and Bruch's. membrane appears intact. DIAGNOSIS Right eye, enucleation: Choroidal melanoma of predominantly spindle' cell type. COMMENT Immunohistochemistry will be carried out for completion. In addition, molecular genetic examination of Dna extracted from the tumour cells will be performed using. multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLpA). looking at chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8.~A supplementary report will follow in due course. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT - Immunohistochemistry confirms that tumour cells express Melan-A and Hsp 27 (score 2).

These investigations were performed in the The kit p027 from which examines for gains or losses in 37 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using  and the quality assessed using multiplex-pcR prior to the MLPA reaction. The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on assessment. The MLpA reaction was run at least twice on differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLpA products is printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated: essentially normal chromosome lp, 3 borderline losses of chromosome 3 in the presence of 3 borderline gains, gains in chromosome 6p and normal chromosome 8.
