Surgical Pathology Consultation Report. Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pTX: Primary tumor of lip or oral cavity cannot be assessed pNX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed for aerodigestive sites pMX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed Comment The T stage is deferred in the synoptic report as the bone is still pending decalcification. Gross Description 1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as Oral Cavity: Portion maxilla. It consists of a portion of right maxilla measuring 5.0 AP x 2.0 Sl x 3.1 ML cm. It includes a portion of gingiva and roof of mouth/palate with four teeth. There is a tumor arising in the roof of mouth extending into the alveolar ridge going into the gingiva. The tumor measures 2.2 AP x 0.8 Sl x 2.1 ML cm. The tumor is solid in consistency and tan-brown in color. There is gross involvement of bone by the tumour. The tumor is located at 0.5 cm from the closest superior gingival margin. Remaining margins are as follows: Anterior gingival margin 2.3'cm; posterior gingival margin-1.1 cm; posterior palate margin-0.8 cm; medial palate margin 0.7 cm. Representative sections are submitted. 1A- superior gingival margin 1B- anterior gingival margin 1C- posterior gingival margin 1D- posterior palate margin 1E- medial palate margin 1F-1G- tumor 1H- normal gingiva and palate 11- anterior maxilla margin 1J- posterior maxilla margin 1K-1L- superior maxillary margin 1M- medial maxillary margin. 1N-1O- mid maxilla with tumor.. Three pieces of tumor/one piece normal were taken for tissue bank. 2. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as "Oral Cavity: Deep mucosal margin". It consists of a fragment of tissue measuring 1.4 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. 2A- specimen in toto. 3. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as "Oral Cavity: Posterior margin'. It consists of a fragment of tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm.. 3A- specimen in toto. 4. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as "Oral Cavity: Medial margin". It consists of a fragment of tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. 4A- specimen in toto. Page 2 of 3

Surgical Pathology Consultation Report Addendum Comment 1. Maxilla (bone sections) - The tumour is present directly adjacent to bone but without invasion. - The maxillary bone margins are negative for tumour. - Tumour is present in the soft tissue adjacent to the superior bone margin.. - The tumour is staged as pT2 - tumour more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
