Immunostains for CK 903' and racemase on 19 and D22 support the diagnoses of prostatic adenocarcinoma..

The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in Ars. B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Left distal ureter". It consists of a segment of soft tubular gray tissue measuring 0.2 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter.  The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in BFs. C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Apical urethral margin-f/s". It consists of a piece of soft pink tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted by for frozen section diagnosis in cFs. D: The specimen is received fresh from the o.R. and labeled "pladder, prostate". The specimen overall measures 32 x 16.5 x 5.5 cm and is partially covered in a shiny, fatty, yellow-pink peritoneum measures 26.5 x 15.5 x less than 0.1 cm. The specimen consists of a bladder (15 x 9 x 5.s cm) and attached prostate (5 x 4.2 x 3.3 cm). The right attached seminal vesicle measures 3.7 x'1.8 x 0.6 cm and the left attached seminal vesicle measures 3.3 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.  The surgical margin of the entire specimen is inked black, with the right side inked with superimposed red.  The specimen is opened along the anterior urethra revealing a prostatic urethra measuring 3 cm in length x 3 cm in circumference. The verumontanum measures 1.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The urethral mucosa is pink-tan, smooth, and does -not appear to be excavated.  The bladder is almost entirely filled by huge, necrotic, bloody, friable, soft, exophytic mass which measures 14.5 x 8'x 5 cm.  The mass appears to arise from the left lateral wall. Upon sectioning through the mass, the cut surfaces are coagulative, solid, soft and ranges in color from red to yellowish in a marbled pattern. Upon sectioning through the mass's relationship to the left lateral wall, it appears to arise from the solid, firm, light tan mass at the base and to extend into the bladder wall but not involve the underlying perivesical fat. The tumor appears to be 1 cm from the inked black margin. Bilateral attached ureters are opened.. The right ureter measures 6 cm in length x 1.2 cm in circumference and the left ureter measures 7.3 cm in length x i.1 cm in circumference. The ureteral mucosa are both grossly unremarkable. The remaining bladder mucosa is gray, congested, and grossly unremarkable elsewhere, except for the trigone where there is a firm nodularity.. The specimen is taken to the o.R. in. a gross consultation. The urothelium is fixed in Bs fixative for an hour and the specimen is subsequently entirely fixed in formalin. The prostate is serially sectioned from distal to proximal, revealing smooth, solid, grossly unremarkable,
