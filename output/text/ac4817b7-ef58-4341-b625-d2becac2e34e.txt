Part D. contains only fat tissue. called by Dr. to Dr. at GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT BREAST WLE NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Received fresh with accompanying radiogram is an oriented 41 g lumpectomy specimen with. Iocalization needie. The specimen is oriented with a single suture designating anterior, double lateral, triple superior. The specimen measures 5.8 cm from anterior to posterior, 5.2 cm from superior to inferior, and 2.8 cm from medial to lateral. Specimen is inked as follows: inferior-orange, superior-red, lateral-yellow, anterior-blue, medial-green, posterior-black. Specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior; there is a firm well-circumscribed white-tan nodule measuring 1 cm located 1 cm from the nearest posterior and anterior margins, 1.8 cm from the lateral margin, 3.1 cm from the medial margin, and greater than 3 cm from the superior and inferior margins. A gross diagnosis is conveyed to O. R. A. portion of the mass is submitted for tissue procurement. Specimen is submitted entirely as follows: A1-A3: superior margin perpendicuiar sections A4: slice 2, medial A5: slice 2, mid A6: slice 2, lateral A7: slice 3, medial A8: slice 3, mid A9: slice 3, lateral A10: slice 4, medial A11: slice 4, mid {lesion} A12: slice 4, latera!

LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #4, BIOPSY: -METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1), MEASURING 2.0-MM (MICROMETASTASES) WITH NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION, SEE NOTE. NOTE: Two foci of intraductal papilloma with usual ductal hyperplasia are identified, one adjacent to the invasive tumor and one at the posterior surgical resection margin. p63 and calponin mark the myoepithelial cell layer in the papilloma. Dr. concurs on this interpretation. Micrometastases are identified in sentinel lymph nodes#1, #2 (AE 1/3 positive) and #4. The largest tumor metastasis measures 2-mm. The touch preparations were reviewed, no tumor cells identified. Therefore, this discrepancy is due to sampling error.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by Daka Ilowing the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.
