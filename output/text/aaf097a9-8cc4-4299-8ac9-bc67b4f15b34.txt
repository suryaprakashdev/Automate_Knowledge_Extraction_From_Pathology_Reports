DIAGNOSIS TOTAL LARyNGECTOMY: INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA WITH EXTENSIVE PERINEURAL INVASION AND VASCULAR LYMPHATIC INVASION, INVOLVING THE PIRIFORM SINUS AND LEFT SUPRAGLOTTIC REGION. Margins of resection free of tumor.. (b) LEFT BASE OF TONGUE MARGIN: Skeletal muscle, no tumor present.. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A)  TotAL LARyngecromy - A tota7 laryngectomy specimen,  9.0 (s-I) x 6.5 (L-R) x 4.67 (A-p) cm. There is a roughened red supraglottic tumor present on the Teft side, involving the pyriform sinus. It appears to extend toward the midline and may cross over the midline approximately 1.0 mm. This tumor is 2.7 (M-L) x 2.5 (s-1) cm in size. There is no extension through the base of the epiglottis or the thyroid cartilage, grossly. There is no involvement of the glottic or subglottic areas. No thyroid tissue is included with this Taryngectomy specimen. INK coDe: ' Black - peripheral mucosal margin and anterior aspect of epiglottic remnant. Secrion code:  A1, anterior right mucosal margin (12-2 o'clock, en face,. for frozen section);_A2, right mucosal"margin (2-4:30),_en face for frozen;. A3, posterior mucosal margin (4:30-7:30), en face; A4,'left posterior mucosal margin (7-9 o'clock), en face; A5, left lateral mucosal margin (9 o'cTock-10:30), en face; A6, 1eft' anterior mucosal margin (io:30-12 o'clock), en face; A7, A8, perpendicular sections of superior (12 o'clock), tissue for deep margin, frozen section; A9, sections of right true and false vocal cord; A10,  left section of true and false vocal cord; Al1-Al5, perpendicular radial sections of the left supraglottic area, going from posterior' to midline; A17, radial section, anterior midline, supraglottic area; A18-A23, radial sections of the right supraglottic area..  going from midline to posterior. Reserve. tissue is available. *Fs/DX:  TNVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, MUCOSAL AND DEEP MARGINS, FREE OF TuMOR. (B) LEFT BASE OF TONGUE MARGIN, INK AT TRUE MARGIN - An irregular fragment of tan soft tissue (2.9 x 1,5 x 0.4 cm). One side of the specimen is previously inked blue designating the true margin. The true margin is re-inked in black.
