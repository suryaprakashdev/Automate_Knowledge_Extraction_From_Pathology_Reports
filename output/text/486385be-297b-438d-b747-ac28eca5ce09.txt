Clinical Diagnosis & History: Internal development of enhancing mass on MRI left breast, core biopsy showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma (Ipc) and Dcis, history of right infiltrating ductai carcinoma 0.3 cm 0/6 sentinel lymph node, status post right TM sentinel lymph node biopsy 8/05. Specimens Submitted: 1: sp: Sentinel node #1, level 1, left axilla (fs) 2: SP: Sentinel node #2, level 2, left axilla (fs) 3: SP: Left breast 4: sp: Nonsentinel noue left axilla DIAGNOSIS: 1) LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1 LEVEL I LEFT AXILLA; BXCISION:S CELLS, MEASURING O.5 MM (MICROMETASTATIC), IS IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE UUID:46841185-1719-46B4-835D-E469D6AEFF120 (1/1) ON ADDITIONAL H&E STAINED SECTIONS AND CYTOKERATINSS TCGA-A0-A03I-01A-PR Redacted IMMUNOHISTOCHEMCIAL STAINS (AE1:AE3). - THERE IS NO EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION OF CARCINOMA. 2) LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2 LEVEL II LEFT AXILLA; EXCISION:S - ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE (O/1). - ADDITIONAL HE STAINED SECTIONS AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS FOR CYTOKERATINS AE1:AE3) SHOW NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA. 3) BREAST, LEFT; MASTECTOMY: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, NOS TYPE, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED, HISTOLOGIC GRADE III/III (SLIGHT OR NO TUBULE FORMATION), NUCLEAR GRADE III/III (MARKED VARIATION IN SIZE AND SHAPE), MEASURING 1.1 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION MICROSCOPICALLY. - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) IS ALSO IDENTIFIED, SOLID TYPE. WITH HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE AND MINIMAL NECROSIS. - THE DCIS CONSTITUTES LESS THAN OR BQUAL TO 25% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR MASS, AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH THE INVASIVE COMPONENT. - LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS) IS ALSO IDENTIFIED, CLASSICAL TYPE (TYPE A) INVOLVING SCLEROSING ADENOSIS.  THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT.  THE DCIS IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT - NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE NIPPLE BY BITHER IN SITU OR INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS Ics-0-3 ** Continued on next page ** Sitei brust,Nvs C50.9 h 10/2y/n Criteria Primary Tun ual/Syn

IDENTIFIED. of - CALCIFICATIONS ARE PRESENT IN THR IN SITU AND INVASIVE CARCINOMA, AND IN BENIGN BREAST PARENCHYMA. NO VASCULAR INVASION IS NOTED. NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE SURGICAL MARGINS BY EITHER INVASIVE OR IN SITU CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED. - NO SKIN INVOLVEMENT BY CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED. THE SKIN SHOWS SEBORRHEIC KERATOSIS. THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE SHOWS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES, EXTENSIVE SCLEROSING ADENOSIS, RADIAL SCAR, ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA (ADH), INTRADUCTAL SCLEROSED PAPILLOMA WITH FOCAL ATYPIA, FIBROADENOMA AND CYST FORMATION. RESULTS OF SPECIAL STAINS (ER, PR, HER2-NEU) ARE AS FOLLOW: Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed tissue with the following results for invasive carcinoma (block 6): ESTROGEN RECEPTORS 95% nuclear staining with strong intensity PROGESTERonE RECEPTORE 0% nuclear staining. HER2 (HercepTest; Negative (0 / 1+) (1% of invasive tumor cells exhibit complete membranous staining; Uniformity of staining: absent; Homogeneous, dark circumferential pattern: absent) Controls are satisfactory. Comment: HercepTestTM ( : is an FDA-approved method for assessment of HER2 protein overexpression in breast cancer tissue routinely processed for histological avaluation. The HeR2 test results are reported in accordance with the Asco/cap guideline recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer (J clin Oncol 2007; 25(1):1-28). 4) LYMPH NODE, NON-SENTINEL LEFT AXILLA; EXCISION: ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE (O/1). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Electronically Signea Out *** Gross Description:.

"Sentinel node #1, level 1, left axilla" and consists of a single yellow-tan. firm and fatty lymph node measuring 4.7 cm. The node is trisected and two half are submitted for froren section in cassettes labeled as A and B. remaining fatty portion is bisected and entirely submitted for permanent The section.

The specimen is recaived fresh, labeled "left breast, stitch marks axillary tail" and consists of a breast measuring 25 x 24 x 4 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 24 x 7.5 cm. situated central/superiorly on the skin surface is an everted nipple measuring 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm and. areola measuring 3.0 x 2.7 cm.  The skin shows a raised pigmented lesion measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm, located 1.8 cm medial to the areola. No scar M is grossly identified on the skin surface. A suture demarcates the axillary aspect. The posterior surface of the breast is inked black and the radial margin is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a firm,. white, well-circumscribed mass measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm, located within the upper outer quadrant at the two o'clock aspect,. 1.2 cm from the deep margin. A hemorrhagic biopsy site is associated with the mass. An irregular area of white fibroglandular tissue is located immediately medial to the mass and measures approximately 5 x 5 x 3 cm. No additional discrete masses are grossly identified. Sectioning of the axillary aspect reveals no grossly. identifiable lymph nodes.  Representative sections are submitted. Tps is. taken.
