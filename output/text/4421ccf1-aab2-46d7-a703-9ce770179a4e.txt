SEC. #: PHYSICIAN: GENDER: ADDITIONAL: NO ADDITIONAL PHYSICIANS ACCOUNT #: COPY TO/NOTES: Page 1 df 2 SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED: A: Left kidney & ureter. CLINICAL DATA/HISTORY: Left kidney renal cell cancer. FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: Left Kidney And ureter: PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCiNOMA, TYPE II, NUCLEAR GRADE 3. SYNOPTIC REPORT: tcD o-3  PROCEDURE: RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY. SPECIMEN LATERALITY: LEFT. 8260/3 Tumor site: mid to inferior pole. Tumor size: 15 cm. TUMOR FOCALITY: UNIFOCAL. MAcROSCOPIC EXTenT Of TumOR: LimITeD TO KIDNey. HISTOLOGIC TYPE: PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA. 117714 SARCOMATOID FEATURES:NOTIDENTIFIED. TUmOR NECROSIS: PRESENT.. HistologIC Grade: G3. MICrOSCOPiC TumOR EXTensION: TumOR APpEArs LimITed TO KIDney, SEE COmmenT. MARGINS: MARGINS APPEAR UNINVOLVED BY INVASIVE CARCINOMA, SEE COMMENT.S LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: PRESENT. PATHOLOGIC STAGING: pT2b pNX. COMMENT: The features are of a type ll papillary renal cell carcinoma. Upon receipt of the specimen, there is capsular. disruption about the lower pole of the specimen with axposed necrotic tumor present at surface. Histologic sections do not reveal capsular invasion, and this gros. finding histologically appears to be iatrogenic. Correlation with the clinical findings is needed. Consultant: ***ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED OUT*** GROSS DESCRIPTION: Leit kidney & ureter: Received fresh labeled -. left kidney and ureter" and consists of a 1151 gram. nephrectomy specinen measuring 25 x 15 x 9 cm induding kidney measuring 22 x 12 x 6 cm and perirenal fat ranging in thickness from 1 to 6 cm. Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (6 x 0.5 cm), renal artery measuring 7x 0.5 cm, and renal.vein measuring 0.5 x 1 cm. The renal vein is free of gross abnormality at the margin. The specimen is received with a surface disruption at the inferior pole and at the lateral aspect of the kidney measuring 6 cm in greatest dimension through which friable necrotic debris extrudes. The adjacent fat is marked with black ink. In the mid lower pole and corresponding to the capsular disruption is a well circumscribed predominantly necrotic mass measuring 15 x 10 x 9 cm. The mass lies 1 cm from the renal vein margin and grossly extends through the renal

The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistening mucosa. The adipose. tissue is thinly sectioned, and no lymph nodes are found. The case is reviewed by..  Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:  A1) renal vein, artery and ureter margins en face; A2-3) capsular disruption two fragments per cassette; A4-8) capsule wall, two fragments per cassette; A9) non-neoplastic kidney:. A10) perinephritic fat. At the request ofa  the specimen is regrossed with additional sections of the perihilar blood vessels. submitted in cassettes A11-A15 under the direction of. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections of vascular and ureteral margin tissues do not show a neoplasm. Sections of the grossly described lesion show a necrotic papillary carcinoma with patchy hemosiderin, and areas of variably foamy cytoplasm. Nuclear characteristics show areas of prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear borders. There is assoclated organizing blood. Small vessel vascular space invasion is present. Tumor does not appear to involve renal pelvis or hilar tissues.. Sarcomatoid areas are not seen in the examined sections. .
