GROSS EXAMINATION: Estrogen receptor tissue sent for estrogen and progesterone receptor. A. nTru-cut breast biopsy.": Received fresh. The specimen is a 1 cm x 0.1 cm tan piece of breast tissue. This frozen as frozen section AFl. The frozen section remnant consists of two pieces of tan tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.1 x 0.1 and 0.7 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. They are submitted in toto in Block Al.. B. "Right breast.": Received fresh. The specimen consists of breast with an overlying ellipse of skin.

And contains a nipple at its center. The deep surgical margin is inked blue and made through the deep aspect of of the specimen revealing a 1.5 x 2.8 x 1.0 cm firm mass which radially retracts the adjacent breast tissue and which is located approximately 0.2 cm from the deep surgical margin at one point.  The mass appears located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. Further sectioning through the specimen reveals unremarkable breast parenchyma in areas away from the tumor. Material submitted for ER/PR. Block Summary: B1 and B2-closest sections of tumor to the deep surgical margin inked blue. B3 and B4-Further sections of tumor to the deep surgical margin.. B5-Section through the nipple. B6-Representative sampling from the upper inner quadrant. B7-Representative sampling of the lower inner quadrant. B8-Representative sampling of the upper outer quadrant. B9-Representative sampling of the lower outer quadrant.. B10-Further sections through the lower outer quadrant. The axillary tail is dissected. Tumor margin has been marked with surgical suture.  These are present in zone 2 at the juncture with zone 1 and are submitted separately in Block Bll. B12-Sections of fat from zone 1 appear that no definite lymph nodes are identified in zone 1. B13-Candidate lymph nodes from zone 2. B14, 15 and B16-Candidate lymph nodes from zone 3.
