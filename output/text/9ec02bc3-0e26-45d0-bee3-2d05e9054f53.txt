Lymphatic Invasion: not identified. Venous Invasion: not identified Perineural Invasion: not identified. Surgical margins: - Pancreatic neck: negative (4 mm to inked margin, I13).  Bile duct: negative (I1). : Circumferential/deep: negative (<1 mm to inked margin (I15))  Proximal (gastric): negative (I3, I4).  Distal (duodenal): negative (12) Regional lymph nodes: metastatic adenocarcinoma (2/11), larger metastasis 6 mm diameter, without extracapsular extension.. Additional findings: focal pancreatic parenchymal fibrosis and atrophy, focal peri-common bile duct acute inflammation (l1).. AJCC Stage: pT3 pN1 pMx Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and. additional information..

FsDl: Common bile duct margin, biopsy No tumor seen FsEl: Pancreatic duct margin, biopsy - At least carcinoma in situ, focally suspicious for invasive carcinoma FsFl: Pancreatic margin, additional, biopsy - Pancreatic parenchyma, no duct for evaluation Fsg1: Pancreatic margin #3, biopsy No tumor seen Frozen Section Pathologist: Clinical History: Not dictated. Gross Description: Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section and is a 7 x 5 x 2 mm red/brown soft tissue fragment, which was frozen as FsAl, NTR. Specimen B is received fresh for frozen section and is a 10 x 7 x 3 mm red/brown soft tissue fragment, which was frozen as Fsbl, NTR. Specimen c is received fresh for frozen section and is a 6 x 1 x 1 mm red/brown soft tissue fragment, which was frozen as Fscl, NTR. Specimen D is received fresh for frozen section and is a 9 x 6 x 4 mm red/brown soft tissue fragment, which was frozen as Fsdl, NTR. Specimen E is received fresh for frozen section and is a 4 x 3 x 2 mm pink/tan soft tissue fragment, which was frozen as Fsel, NTR. Specimen F is received fresh for frozen section and is a 6 x 4 x 2 mm red/tan

soft tissue fragment, which was frozen as FsFl, NTR. Specimen G is received fresh for frozen section and is a 2.5 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm red/tan soft tissue fragment, with a stitch on one side indicating the true margin. The surface is inked blue. The specimen was frozen as FSG1, NTR. Specimen H was received in a formalin-filled container labeled "gallbladder". Previously opened: The presumed cystic duct is widely patent. The remainder of the gallbladder appears complete. Measurements: 10.4 x 3.6 x 2.0 cm External surface: Roughened on the hepatic surface, but otherwise pink/tan, subtly discolored green, smooth and glistening and. unremarkable. wall thickness: 2.5 mm on average Mucosa: Green/brown, velvety and unremarkable with no mucosa mass lesions readily identified. Stones present: Not identified Other comments: Gallbladder is partially filled with sticky, viscous dark brown/green bile. This bile is adherent to the mucosa. Block #: H1 Specimen I: Specimen fixation: Formalin Specimen type: Unspecified, but believed to be standard whipple Orientation: Inking: common bile duct/yellow, pancreatic margin/blue, uncinate margin/black, body/green, gastric margin/orange, duodenal margin/red Tumor location: Pancreatic head Gross appearance of tumor: Solid pale yellow/white mass lesion encompassing the majority of the pancreatic head. There are no areas of necrosis, hemorrhage or calcification readily identified.

Tumor dimensions: 4.5 x 2.0 x 3.0 cm Extent of invasion: Confined/nonconfined to the pancreas: Grossly the tumor appears to be invading through the duodenal wall and distorting the duodenal mucosal. This. occurs in the areas of the ampulla. Involvement of the ampulla: Not grossly involved. Involvement of the duodenum: Present Involvement of the bile duct: Absent Involvement of adjacent blood vessels: N/A. Spleen (if applicable): N/A Duodenum (if applicable): N/A Gallbladder (if applicable): N/A Stomach (if applicable): Not involved Surgical margins: Pancreas: Blue inked pancreatic surgical margin, focally close Bile duct: Negative. Proximal (small bowel or stomach) margin: Negative. Distal (small bowel) margin: Negative Peripancreatic soft tissues: Green inked pancreatic margin focally close. Lymph nodes: Multiple lymph node candidates are identified from approximately 3 x 3 x 3 mm to 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. Other remarkable findings: The gastric serosa is red/tan, smooth and glistening and unremarkable. The gastric wall is 2 mm thick on average and the mucosa is red/tan with normal architecture. The duodenal serosa is red/tan, smooth and glistening and unremarkable. The duodenal mucosa is dark brown/tan, glistening with normal architecture. No duodenal abnormalities are readily appreciated. There is some chalky yellow/white discoloration to the pancreatic parenchyma in the distal pancreas, this may represent fat necrosis.. Digital photograph taken: No

Tissue submitted for special investigation: Tumor was given to tissue procurement. Block Summary:. Inking: common bile duct/yellow, pancreatic margin/blue, uncinate margin/black, body/green, gastric margin/orange, duodenal margin/red Il - common bile duct margin en face 12 - duodenal margin en face I3-I4 - majority of gastric margin en face I5-I6 - perpendicular section to blue inked pancreatic body margin I7 - black inked uncinate margin en face I8-I10 - duct from ampulla towards margin, respectively I11 - tumor involving duodenum I12 - additional tumor and duodenum I13 - additional tumor I14-I15 - distal pancreas surrounding adipose tissue (? Fat necrosis present) I16 - stomach. 117 - duodenum I18 - one lymph node candidate from area of common bile duct margin, sectioned I19-120 - one lymph node candidate sectioned (adjacent to inferior pancreas) I21-122 - one peripancreatic lymph node candidate, sectioned 123 - one lymph node candidate, sectioned 124 - one lymph node candidate, sectioned I25 - one lymph node candidate, sectioned I26 - one lymph node candidate I27-129 - additional adipose tissue Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. The frozen section diagnoses are confirmed. Pancreatic duct carcinoma in situ is identified, with associated invasion of pancreatic parenchyma, with extension into peripancreatic fat and wall of duodenum near the ampulla of Vater. Metastatic carcinoma is identified in nodes in blocks I18 and 119.
