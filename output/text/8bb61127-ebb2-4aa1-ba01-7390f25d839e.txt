Left axillary contents: ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR SYNOPSIS Estrogen and progesterone receptor immunohistochemistry stains are performed utilizing the 6fl1 (ER) and 1A6 clones (PR) along. with the iview detection kit. The stains are performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. Both special stains have adequate controls.. ESTROGEN RECEPTORS: Infiltrating malignant cells showing positive staining:. 60 PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: Infiltrating malignant cells showing positive staining:. 10 ESTROGEN RECEPTOR RESULTS: PoSitive. PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR RESULTS:  Positive. Note: Consensus Statement on Adfuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer: Any positive nuclear ER immunostaining is considered a positive. result.

Page 3 of 4 B - Left sentinel node #2: Negative. (Microscopic frozen section). Gross Description A - The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "left sentinel node." The specimen consists of a pink-tan lymph node measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely frozen in cassette "Fs-A1." B - The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "left sentinel node." The specimen consists of a pink-tan lymph node measuring 3 x 2 x 1.2 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely frozen in cassette "Fs-B1." C - The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "left breast suture at 6 o'clock." The specimen consists of a mastectomy specimen without axillary tissue measuring 28 x 23.5 x 50 cm and weighing 1559 gm. There is an overlying tan ellipse of skin measuring 22 x 7 cm and showing an eccentric wrinkled brown areola measuring 4.5 x 4.5 cm. Within the center of the areola there is an inverted soft brown nipple measuring 1.1 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. There are grossly no healed incisions or biopsy sites on the skin surface however the medial edge of the areola is partially stained with blue dye. Attached suture marks the 6 o'clock margin. The deep margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an irregular firm tumor between the upper-inner and lower-inner quadrants approximately 1 cm from the nipple measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm.  The tumor comes to within 3 cm of the deep margin and within 2 cm of the superficial margin (inked blue). Further sectioning reveals a well-circumscribed nodule within the lower-outer quadrant 3.5 cm from the nipple the deep margin. The remaining specimen consists of lobulated fat interspersed with a large amount of tan-white irregularly-indurated tissue with scattered cysts filled with clear fluid measuring up to 0.4 cm in diameter. A lymph node is identified at the axillary margin measuring 1 x 1 x 0.7 cm. Representative sections are submitted in 12 cassettes. cross-section of nipple, "3-4" - tumor, "5" - superficial and *"11" tissue underlying the nipple stained with blue dye, "12" - bisected lymph node at the axillary margin. D - The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "left axillary contents." The specimen consists of a tan-yellow portion of axillary fatty tissue measuring 8 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm and weighing 53 gm. Sectioning reveals 11 potential lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 to 2.3 cm in greatest dimensions. The lymph nodes are totally submitted in 4 cassettes. Block summary: "1" - i lymph nodes 1 of which is bisected, "2" 2 bisected lymph nodes, "3" - 1 bisected lymph node, "4" - 1 bisected lymph node.
