Rec #: Submitting Physician: Clinical History Neovascular glaucoma of right eye [365.63]. Intraocular tumor [239.89]. Total retinal detachment of right eye [36l.05]. Medical history: -year-old with large choroidal malignant tumor. Blind painful eye with Nvg. Gross photos. Evaluate malignant tumor. Differential diagnosis includes metastasis and uveal melanoma. ---Final Pathologic Diagnosis-- A. Right eye, resection: Choroidal melanoma (amelanotic), see synoptic report Iris neovascularization with partial angle closure Retinal detachment IaD o3 - Cataract Malantmo, ypithelirolesQ0 SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR UVEAL MELANOMA Procedure: 87713 Enucleation: Specimen Size: C69.3 For Enucleation: Anteroposterior diameter: 25 mm Horizontal diameter: 23 mm )3/12/14 Vertical diameter: 24 mm Length of optic nerve: 11 mm Diameter of optic nerve: 3 mm Specimen Laterality: Right Tumor Site: Other (specify): Posterior adjacent to optic disc Page 1 of 5

rage  or  Tumor Size: LBD: 16 mm (gross); 13 mm (from slide) Height: 10 mm (gross); 11 mm (from slide). Tumor Involvement of Ocular Structures: Choroid posterior Retina Tumor Location After Sectioning (microscopic) Distance from anterior edge of tumor to limbus at cut edge: 1l mm Distance of posterior margin of tumor base from edge of optic disc: 0 mm Growth Pattern: Solid Histopathologic Type: Epithelioid cell melanoma (greater than 90t epithelioid cells) Histologic Grade (pG): pG3 Microscopic Tumor Extension Tumor Location Anterior margin between disc and equator Posterior margin between disc and equator Scleral Involvement: None Margins No melanoma at margins Extrascleral extension (for enucleation specimens) - negative Pathologic Staging (pTNM) pT3a NX MX Additional Pathologic Findings (select all that apply) Mitotic rate (number of mitoses per 40x objective with a field area of 0.152 mm2): 1/40 high power fields Microvascular patterns: poorly formed vascular mimicry patterns present Vascular invasion (tumor vessels or other vessels): negative Degree of pigmentation: none Inflammatory cells/tumor infiltrating lymphocytes: present/mild Drusen: none Retinal detachment: present Invasion of Bruch' s membrane: yes. Nevus: negative Hemorrhage: negative Neovascularization: yes Other: fibrous plaque overlying tumor Comment(s): pAs stain was used to evaluate for possible vascular mimicry patterns. Cytokeratin AEl/3 is negative (ruling out carcinoma/metastasis): and HmB-45 and melanA are strongly positive, consistent with melanoma. All controls show appropriate reactivity.. Immunohistochemical (Ihc) testing for HER2 is performed accordinq to manufacturer' s instructions at ! In-situ hybridization tests were developed by and are performed at the All other Ihc and histochemical tests were developed by and are performed at the  Al tests reported here, except those addressing HEr2 overexpression as a predictive marker, are not required to have nor do they have FDA approval. ***Electronically Signed By*** M.D. Page 2 of 5
