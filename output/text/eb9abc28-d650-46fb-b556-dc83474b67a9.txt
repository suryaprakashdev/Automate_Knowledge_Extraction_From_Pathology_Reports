SPECIMENS: A. RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY DIAGNOSIS: A. RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY WITH PARTIAL SEGMENTS 5-6: - MODERATELY TO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF CECUM, TUMOR SIZE 6 X 3 CM. - CARCINOMA INFILTRATING THROUGH BOWEL WALL AND INVADING TO ADJACENT LIVER PARENCHYMA.  SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS OF BOWEL AND LIVER TISSUE, FREE OF TUMOR - METASTATIC CARCINOMA PRESENT IN ONE OF THIRTY-SEVEN PERICOLIC LYMPH NODES (1/37).  SEE TEMPLATE. COLORECTAL CANCER TEMPLATE Specimen Type: Right hemicolectomy Tumor Site: Cecum Tumor Configuration: Exophytic, ulcerating Tumor Size: 6 x 3 x 3 cm Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma Histologic Grade: G2-3, moderately to poorly differentiated Extent of Invasion: Adjacent structure: liver Margins: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (proximal, distal, radial) Venous/Lymphatic Invasion:. Indeterminate Perineural Invasion:  Present Additional Pathologic Findings:. NA Extent of Resection: R0: complete resection with grossly and microscopically negative margins. Lymph Nodes: Positive (1/37) Implants: NA EGFR Expression: pending Pathologic Stage: pT4a, N1 Mx SPECIMEN(S): A. RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY CLINICAL HISTORY: Colon cancer GROSS DESCRIPTION:  RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY WITH PARTIAL SEGMENTS 5-6 Received fresh is a segment of cecum with attached terminal ileum, overall measuring 15x14x6.5cm. Both ends are stapled. The attached terminal ileum is measuring 8cm in length, 3cm in diameter.. Attached to the cecum also identified a small piece of liver segment measuring 3.0x6.0x2.0cm. The serosa is inked black. Opening of the cecum reveals close to the ileocecal valve, there is a tumor which measures 6.0x3.0x3.0cm on the mucosa and 4.5cm away from the stapled distal margin on the colon and less than 1cm away from the ileocecal valve. The surface of the tumor is ulcerated and sectioning through the tumor reveals the tumor is already penetrating through the muscularis propria reaching into  the serosa, which might caused the adhesion to the liver. The rest of the mucosa in colon and terminal ileum are unremarkable. The sections are submitted as follows: A1: shaved margins from distal margin on the colon. A2: shaved margins from terminal ileum A3-A4: representative sections across the tumor into the adhered liver. A5: representative sections across the tumor into the ileocecal valve. A6-A8: representative section from the deepest invaded tumor A9: representative sections from grossly unremarkable mucosa in terminal ileum and colon A10: representative sections from appendix including the base, mid portion and tip. A11: additional section from the junction of tumor and liver.. A12-A16: 24 presumptive lymph nodes
