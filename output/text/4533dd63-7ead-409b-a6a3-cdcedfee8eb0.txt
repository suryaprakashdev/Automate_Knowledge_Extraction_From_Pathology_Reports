Reported to Gross Description The case is received in seven containers, each with the patient's name and medical record number. Specimen 1 is designated "right aortic node" and is received fresh for frozen section and is described then as one piece of red-tan soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1 cm and dissected to reveal multiple potential Tymph hodes frozen in toto as 1A. The remaining specimen Is now received following formalin fixation and is submitted as 1A in toto. Specimen 2 is received fresh and is labeled "teft pelvic node". The Specimen consists of multiple fragments of yellow-tan soft tissue measuring 6.1 x 4.1 x 1.2 cm in aggregate. Further dissection reveais six potential Tymph nodes, as large as 1.2 cm, which are dissected and submitted in 2A-C Specimen 3 is received fresh and is labeled *right peivic node". The  specimen consists of multiple fragments of tan fatty soft tissue measuring 5.8 x 3.7 x 1.4 cm aggregate. The specimen contalns multiple potential Tymph nodes as large as 0.9 cm, and are submitted in 3A through 3D. Specimen 4 is received fresh and is labeled "portion of right parametrium". The specimen consists of one portion of tan soft tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm and is submitted in toto in 4A. Specimen 5 is received fresh and is labeled portlon of left parametrium. The specimen consists one portion of tan soft tissue measuring 1.6 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm, and is submitted in toto in 5A. Specimen 6 is received fresh and is labeled "uterus, tubes and ovaries, parametrium of upper vagina". The specimen weighs 233.3 grams in toto. The uterus measures 7.9 cm superior to inferior, 7.1 cm cornu to cornu, and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior, and measures 3 cm in length, 4.6 cm lateral to Jateral, and 4.4 cm anterlor to posterior. The cervix is notable for a protruding friable red-tan mass appearing to be a posterlor lesion. The

I.ab Results : Single Panel :. Page 3 of 4 specimen also contains a cuff of vagina measuring from 1.2 to 2.7 cm, and grossly free of tumor. The serosa of the uterus and cervix Is smooth and glistening. The uterus and cervix are bivalved along the anterlor-posterlor border to reveal the following: An endocervical canal 4.0 long, 0.4 cm ls  wide, an unremarkable endometrlal cavity 4.6 cm long, and 3.9 cm wlde, and 0.1 cm thick, and a myometrium notabie for a thickness of 1.4 cm. The Specimen Is Inked as following: Biack is anterlor, green Is posterlor, and Ehe vaginal cuff is inked blue. The posterlor ectocervix is replaced by a fungating mass leslon measuring 4.5 cm lateral to lateral and 2.9~cm anterior to posterior x 2.6 cm superlor to Inferlor, with a tan- white Surface. The mass lesion Is tocated approximately 1 cm from the lower uterine segment posteriorly, and 1.5 cm from the anterior uterine segment. The mass Is located 1.5 cm from the closest vaginal margin. Right and left parametria are shaved. They are grossly uninvoived by tumor. The left parametrial are submitted in toto in 6A through D, and the right parametrial Is submitted in 6E through 6H. The vaginal cuff is submitted as follows: Left anterior cuff in 6I, right anterlor cuff and 6J, and left posterior cuff in 6 K and right posterior cuff in 6L. An uninvolved portion of vaginal cuff is cut off. The cervix is then processed as a cone, and submitted as follows: 2:00 as 6M, 12:30 as 6N, 1:00 as 6O, 2:00 as 6P, 2:30 6Q, 3:00 as 6R, 3:30 as 6S, 4:00 as 6T, 4:30 in 6U and 6V, 5:00 in 6W and 6X, 6:00 in 6Y and 6Zand 7:00 as 6AA and 6BB, 8:00 as 6CC, 8:30 as 6DD, 9:00 as 6EE, 9: 30 as 6FF, 10:00 as 6GG, and 11:00 as 6HH. A sectlon through anterior endocervix and lower uterine segment is submitted in 6II, and a section through posterior endocervix and lower uterine segment is. submitted in 6JJ. A full thickness cross-section through anterior endometrlum and myometrium is submitted in 6KK and a full thickness cross section through posterior endometrium myometrium is 6LL. The right ovary measures 4.0 x 2.8 x 1.8 cm and the right fallopian tube measures 3.3 cm x 0.3 cm in greatest dimension, Upon sectioning, the right ovary multicystic and hemorrhagic with the cysts as large as 1.5 cm S in diameter. Section through right ovary and adjacent falloplan tube is submitted in 6MM and representative sections of the right fallopian tube which looks grossly unremarkable is submitted in 6NN. The left ovary measures 3.7 x 2.9 x 1.2 cm and the left fallopian tube measures 3.6 cm x 0.3 cm in greatest diameter. Upon sectloning, the left ovary is cystic and has a cyst as large as 0.6 cm."A representative section of ovary with adjacent fallopian tube 1

Specimen 7 is received fresh and is labeled "left uterine artery". The speclmen consists of one portlon of yellow-tan soft tissue measurlng 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto and 7A.
