ONE LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. COMMENT: There is a microscopic focus of lobular carcinoma in situ with 1.0 mm of invasive carcinoma in soction 1A (section of the nipple). This focus is highlighted by Immunostain, e-cadherin and p120, (see Microscopic Descriptlon). Sentinel lymph node #2 shows rare keratin positive cells . Lymph node #1 (Part 3), is almost complotely replaced by fat.
