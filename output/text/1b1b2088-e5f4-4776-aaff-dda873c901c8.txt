Specimen submitted as follows 1 Section for frozen 2&4 The reminders of the specimen in toto B. Received in formalin and labeled "sentinel node # 2 count fs" consists of irregular shaped, adipose tissue fragment, 2.6 x 1.8 x 0.5 cm. Specimen submitted as follows 1 Sections for frozen 2&3 Reminders of specimen in toto c.  Received in formalin and labeled *right breast 1 short superior, 1 long lateral fs" consists of a mastectomy specimen weighing 6.63 grams and measures 20.0 x 16.0 x 4.0 cm. Specimen is oriented with a short stitch superior and a long stitch lateral. There is an ellipse of skin present, 10.0 x 5.5 cm the nipple and areola are present. The areola complex measure 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The nipple is inverted, dlstracted and measures 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. For. gross purpose the specimen is inked as follow: Superior resection margin inked blue, inferior resection margin inked green, medial resection margin inked red, laterai resection margin inked orange, anterior margin inked yelloy and posterior surgical resection margin inked black. Sectioning of the specimen reveals an ill-defined, pale-tan, fim mass, 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. This mass is grossly located 1.0 cm from Inferior resection margin and 3.0 cm from lateral re$ection margin. It is located 2.0 cm from the anterior resection margin and 1.0 cm from the deep resection margin. Ypon sectioning the stroma is composed of yellow, iobulated adipose tissue. The firm, white area is closely associated with the skin. No other lesions are identified. Specimen submitted as follows. Inferior margin for frozen sections 7 Page 3 of 4
