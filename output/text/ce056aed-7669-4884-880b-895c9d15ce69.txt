*** Diagnosis/Diagnoses: *** 1. Sections of a polypoid neoplasm of the colonic mucosa with the structure of a tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia or transition to at least intramucosal adenocarcinoma in situ (synonym according to WHO: high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia, according to IUCC: pTis) 2.: Small, or only small portions of, tubular adenomas of the colonic mucosa with slight dysplasia (synonym: low-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia). 3.: Tubular adenoma of the colonic mucosa with high-grade dysplasia and transition to an intramucosal adenocarcinoma (synonym according to WHO: high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia, according to IUCC: pTis) In 1. and 3., no detectable transition to a manifest, deeper colon carcinoma infiltrating the wall layers. Complete tumor resection -- where not already done - is recommended Diagnosis/Diagnoses Right hemicolectomy specimen with an ulcerated colon carcinoma in the area of the cecal pole measuring 4 cm in the largest diameter and displacing the appendiceal orifice, arising from a tubulovillous adenoma with severe epithelial dysplasia (synonym: high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia). Invasive tumor spread as far as the muscularis propria. Appendix with formation of an obstructive type of mucocele and with persistent or florid chronic appendicitis and. perityphlitis. Oral and aboral resection margin and greater omentum tumor-free.. Twenty-four mesocolic and mesenteric lymph nodes tumor-free and with uncharacteristically reactive changes.
