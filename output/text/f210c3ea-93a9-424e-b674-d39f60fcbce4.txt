E: Bladder, prostate F: Ileocectomy Gross Description: The specimens are received in six containers each labeled with the patient's. name and medical record number.. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of fibrous adipose tissue measuring 5.0 x 3.6 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is consistent with matted firm lymph nodes measuring 4.1 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node aggregate is serially sectioned and submitted in cassettes A1-A6. B. The second container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of dense fibrotic tissue and matted lymph nodes measuring 7.1 x 3.7 x 2.3 cm. Representative sections of largest matted lymph node are submitted in cassettes B1-B5, and smaller fibrotic lymph node is submitted in cassette B6.. C. The third container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple ovoid soft tissue fragments measuring in aggregate 5.5 x 4.5 x 1.2 cm. Upon examination several apparent lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.2-1.5 cm in greatest dimension which is submitted as follows: C1: 1 sectioned lymph node C2: 2 lymph nodes C3-C6: 4 lymph node candidates, each cassette D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple soft and rubbery fiber adipose tissue fragments measuring in aggregate 9.5 x 6.5 x 2.5 centimeters. The largest piece measures 6.7 x 4.2 x 2.2 cm and represents firm  matted lymph nodes Up on examination multiple apparent matted lymph nodes and. lymph node candidates identified ranging in size from 0.3-2.4 centimeters. Lymph nodes are submitted as follows:. D1-D3: Representative sections of largest matted lymph node. D4-D5: Representative sections of second largest matted lymph node D6-D7: 3 lymph nodes, each cassette D8: 1 matted lymph node D9: 1 sectioned matted lymph node. D10-D11: 1 sectioned matted lymph node D12: 4 lymph node candidates E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, "bladder/prostate" Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 316.9 g, 16 x 9 x 4.8 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 6.5 x 6 x 2.5 cm bladder with

--- Page 4 ---
attached mesenteric fat and a focal and 5 x 4 x 2.8 cm prostate. The right seminal vesicles measure 4 x 2 x 1.5 cm and right vas deferens measures 10 cm. The left seminal vesicles measures 3.5 x 2 x 1 cm and left vas deferens measures 12 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 1.4 x 0.4 cm, the left measures 1.0 x 0.4 cm, and both demonstrate intact, patent lumens. The ureteral margin has jagged appearance and measures 0.1-0.4 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra. The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule which is partially disrupted at anterior surface and sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity with no discrete masses or indurations. The opened bladder reveals a 3.4 x 2.2 cm shaggy, deep red tan ulceration located in posterior wall and bladder dome. This ulcerated area is located 5 centimeters from distal urethral margin, 0.4 cm from right ureter orifice and 0.6 cm from left ureter orifice, but does not involve ureters or trigone area On cut section, the ulcerated area is superficial, measuring up to 0.3 cm in thickness, and grossly involves underlying densely fibrotic muscularis propria. It is located 1.8 cm from the deep inked margin. The surrounding bladder mucosa is edematous, congested, pink-tan with a uniform 0.3 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe patent. Representative sections are submitted as follows: E1: Left ureter resection margin E2: Right ureter resection margin E3: Distal urethral margin E4: Distal prosthetic margin (apex) E5-E8: Bladder Ulceration E9: Bladder dome adjacent to ulcer E10: Anterior wall. E11: Posterior wall. E12-E14: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base. E15-E17: Representative left lobe of prostate submitted from apex to base E18: Bilateral seminal vesicles E19: Bilateral vas deferens F. The sixth container is additionally identified as, "ileocecectomy". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an ileocecectomy specimen composed of a 10 cm segment of terminal ileum attached to a 16.5 cm segment of proximal colon. The serosa is pink-tan, smooth, glistening with attached omentum and pericolonic adipose tissue, measuring up to 1.5 cm in thickness. The inner circumference of proximal terminal ileum margin measures 8 cm. The inner circumference of distal colonic margin measures 9 cm. There is stricture at the

ileocecal valve with significant narrowing of lumen which measures 4 cm in circumference. The specimen is opened to show tan circumferentially folded.  mucosa with numerous small polypoid lesions in terminal ileum measuring from 0.1-0.3 cm in diameter. The large bowel mucosa is tan, edematous, and contains an area of retracted mucosa measuring 3.5 x 1.5 cm which is adjacent to ileocecal valve. The segment of large bowel has a wall thickness ranging from 0.4-0.8 cm and significant fibrotic thickening up to 1.5 cm underneath retracted mucosa. There is a sessile polyp measuring 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm which is located. 1.4 cm from the distal margin which is inked blue. There is also an ulcerated area measuring 0.6 x 0.4 cm which is located 2.8 cm from the distal margin. Serosa overlying ulcerated area inked black. The attached adipose tissue is dissected for lymph node candidates. Three lymph nodes are identified ranging. in size from 0.2-0.7 cm. Appendix is submitted with the specimen and measures 5.2 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The appendiceal serosa is pink-red and glistening and sectioning shows a patent, pinpoint lumen and a wall thickness of 0.2 cm.
