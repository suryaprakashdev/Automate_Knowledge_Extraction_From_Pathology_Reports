SPECIMENS: A. RIGHT COLON DIAGNOSIS: A. RIGHT COLON, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY: - EXOPHYTIC CIRCUMFERENTIAL ULCERATED INVASIVE MODERATE TO POORLY DIFEERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF CECUM. PROXIMAL ASCENDING COLON WITH EXTENSION TO ILEOCECAL VALVE, WITH FULL MUSCLE WALL THICKNESS INVASION, EXTENSION TO SUB- SEROSAL FAT., METASTASIS TO SIX OF THIRTY-SIX (6/36) PERICOLIC LYMPH NODES (WITH PERINODAL FAT EXTENSION). - SIZE OF TUMOR- 8 X 4 X1 CM. - TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA (1.2 X 1.1 CM). - VERMIFORM APPENDIX - NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR - PROXIMAL, DISTAL AND RADIAL MARGINS OF RESECTION - NEGATIVEE FOR TUMOR. COLORECTAL CANCER TEMPLATE Specimen Type: Right hemicolectomy Tumor Site: Cecum,proximal ascending coln. Tumor Configuration: Exophytic (polypoid), Infiltrative, Ulcerating Tumor Size: 8.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma Histologic Grade: G3 Extent of Invasion:  Subserosa Margins:  Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma  Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Present Perineural Invasion: Present Additional Pathologic Findings: Adenoma Extent of Resection: R0 Positive (6/36) Lymph Nodes:  Implants: Absent EGFR Expression: Pending Pathologic Stage: pT3 N2 MX ADDENDUM: Additional report: Results of immunostain: EGFR ( section with tumor,#A5) - negative immunoreactivity. SPECIMEN(S): A. RIGHT COLON GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT COLON TERMINAL ILEUM: Received fresh labeled with the patient's name, unit number and "right colon terminal ileum' is a 28.5x8.5x4 cm. right hemicolectomy specimen. The ileum is 8 cm. long and 7 cm. in circumference, the colon is 20.5 cm. Iong, 8.5 cm. in circumference and the attached appendix is 5.8 cm. long and 0.9 cm. in diameter. The serosal surface of the specimen is tan, smooth and multiple firm lymph nodes are palpated throughout the adherent pericolonic fat at the cecum. The specimen when opened shows a circumferential exophytic centrally ulcerated tumor with raised indurated peripheral borders occupying proximal ascending colon,cecum, and extending to involved the iliocecal valve,measuring 8x4x1.0 cm.

Tumor 14.5 cm from distal,and 5.5cm from proximal margin.Cut sections show tan white granular surface.and tumor seen infiltrating muscle wall and grossly appears to extend to subjacent subserosal fat. The rest of colonic mucosa shows a flattened appearance .with a small polyp along hepatic flexure measuring 1.2x1.1 cm. Dissection of the adherent pericolonic fat shows multiple lymph nodes,the Iargest measuring 2x1.1x0.9 cm. Appendix is grossly free of tumor. Multiple sections submitted as follows in 30 cassettes labeled A1-A17.
