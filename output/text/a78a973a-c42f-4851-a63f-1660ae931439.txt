ADDITIONAL AXILLARY NODES LEFT  Received in formalin are multiple tan-pink fragments of fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 4.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. Dissection reveals 7 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. A1: 4 possible lymph nodes A2: 4 possible lymph nodes A3: 2 possible lymph nodes A4-A5: 1 lymph node serially sectioned. B. LEFT BREAST WITH AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1 & 2 Received fresh is a 2,422 gm oriented radical mastectomy specimen, 31 x 27 x 10 cm. The specimen is partially surfaced with a tan-brown ellipse of skin, 27 x 14.5 cm. The centrally located darkened areola rim measures 3.0 cm and the partially flattened nipple measures 1.0 cm. The skin surface is. remarkable for a gray-white linear well healed scar, 3.5 cm in length and measuring 6.0 cm from the nipple in the upper outer quadrant. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior/superior-blue, anterior/inferior-orange, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 13 slices; slice 1 being most medial, slice 13 being most lateral. The nipple is located in slice four. The cut surface reveals a gray-white firm/necrotic ill defined mass located in the upper outer central outer quadrant in slice 6, 7 8 and 9, measuring 0.6 cm from the closest deep margin. The mass measures 9.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm, and corresponds to the scar on the skin surface. The remainder of the specimen reveals yellow lobulated adipose tissue interdispersed with gray-white fibrous tissue. The axillary tail  measures 8.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm. Dissection reveals 27 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. Slice 11 and 12 are remarkable for 3 large firm lymph nodes, ranging from 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm to 5.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm. Portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. B1: 1 lymph node, serially sectioned slice 11 B2-B5: 1 lymph node, serially sectioned slice 11 & 12. B6-B12: 1 lymph node, serially sectioned slice 11 & 12.

TSE Block Number: 844 ER: Negative Allred Score:  0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 PR: Negative Allred Score:  0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0 COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the.. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from O to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY:  Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.  Immunohistochemistry was performed usina the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: B44 Interpretation:  NEGATIVE Intensity: 1+ % Tumor Staining: 5% Fish Ordered:  No  METHODOLOGY:  Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analvsis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit :.  using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides.  provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.
