additional information.. Comment: Immunohistochemical stains are performed and demonstrate the tumor is diffusely positive for HepPar-1 while being negative for Ck7 and ck20.. Vimentin and CD31 outline blood vessels. Overall the immunohistologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis: from A frozen section was requested by Dr. on. at FsAl: Liver, capsule at lesser curve of stomach, biopsy - Chronic inflammation and fibrosis Drs. at am on Frozen Section Pathologist:, MD Clinical History: The patient is a -year-old female with a clinical diagnosis of. hepatocellular carcinoma. Operation being performed is "left hepatic resection". As per Web. Cis, the patient has a 9.2 x 8.9 mass involving segments 2 and 3 in the left. lobe of the liver. Gross Description: Received are two appropriately labeled containers.. Container A is additionally labeled "liver capsule at lesser curve of stomach" and holds one tan cassette and bits of soft tissue. The cassette is additionally labeled "msll- FsAl". At frozen section specimen A is described as weighing 1.7 grams and measuring 3.4 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm and appears as a red/tan soft tissue fragment that was serially sectioned. A representative

section was submitted into block FsAl. On gross examination the. remaining strips of soft tissue are submitted into blocks Al and A2 with no tissue remaining. Container B is additionally labeled "hepatocellular carcinoma, segments 2 and 3 of liver, long stitch = cranial hepatic margin at Ivc, short stitch = caudal hepatic margin". Specimen Type: Left hepatic resection, segments 2 and 3 Specimen Weight: 480 grams Measurement: 12.4 x 10.7 x 8.7 cm Orientation: The margin of resection has been previously inked. as follows: long stitch half/black (cranial), short stitch half/blue (caudal). Mass: The cut section of the liver parenchyma shows a 10 x 7.9 x. 7.5 cm yellow/tan mass; focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis are evidence, with an estimate percent necrosis at 30% Adjacent liver tissue: Tan with no other masses or lesions identified. Capsule: Shows focal fibrofatty adhesions with an area of the liver mass. The remaining portion of the capsule is smooth. Major portal vein/ hepatic vein: N/A Margins: At closest approach, the liver mass is 0.3 cm away from. the margin of resection. Gallbladder: Not present Block Summary: Inking: Cranial margin/black, caudal margin/blue B1-B2 - Tumor and margin of resection B3 - B4-B9 - Tumor, representative sections B10 - Liver and normal liver, transition B11 - Normal liver
