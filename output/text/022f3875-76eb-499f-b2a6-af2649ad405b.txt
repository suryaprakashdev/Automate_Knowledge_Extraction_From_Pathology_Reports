SPECIMEN A. Sigmoid colon, upper rectum and adherent posterior bladder wall and small intestines B. Appendix CLINICAL NOTES PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Rectal cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "sigmoid, upper rectum with adherent posterior bladder. wall and small intestines". The specimen consists of a rectosigmoid colon with adherent portions of small bowel and possible portion of. bladder. A segment of small bowel was 12 cm long, stapled at both ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black. A portion of colon is 46 cm long. Both ends are stapled, inked blue and the. opposite is opened and is inked black. There is also a small portion of possible bladder, which is 7 x 5 cm. This is smooth to slightly velvety and the margin of this is inked blue. Orientation. cannot be determined.  One end away from the tumor is inked blue. The opposite end close to the tumor is inked black. The specimen is opened to show a large fungating mass, which is 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. This comes within 2.5 cm of the black inked margin. This tumor is centrally necrotic and goes through the wall of the colon, into the. surrounding fat and through the wall of the small bowel into the mucosa of the small bowel. The remainder of the mucosa of small bowel is pink-tan smooth glistening with normal slightly dilated poles having an average circumference of 6.5 cm and the mucosal alteration of tumor is 3.5 x 3.5 cm. This comes within equidistant luminal margins of the small bowel. The tumor also comes through the wall into the fat and possibly involves the mucosa of the portion of bladder. This is velvety, coming within 0.5 cm of the nearest peripheral margin. The remainder of the mucosa of the specimen is pink-tan smooth glistening with an average. circumference of 9.5 cm. The tumor comes within 1.5 cm of being circumferential and shows a markedly necrotic central focus. Lymph nodes are grossly identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Representative luminal margins of small bowel,. 2  representative section of small bowel tumor, 3-4 - representative section of bladder to tumor, 5 - representative luminal margins of. the colon, 6 - representative section of tumor to normal, 7 and 8. representative sections of tumor to fat, 9-12 - have six possible

lymph nodes have four possible lymph nodes each. RS-15. B. Received in formalin labelled "appendix" is a 6.3 x 0.7 cm appendix which is partially covered with pink-tan smooth glistening serosa and yellow lobular fat.  The specimen is sectioned to show an intact wall with. an average thickness of 0.4 cm. The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 0.4 cm and shows possible diverticula present. No other discrete gross lesions are identified. The entire specimen with the exception of the fat is. submitted in t settes. As-2 (fat retained), proximal end. inked. As-2. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A. Microscopic exam of the resection shows:. Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Primary tumor(pT): Tumor invades through the entire colonic wall and through the entire adhesed small intestinal wall into the lumen of the small intestine. The tumor also invades into the muscularis propria of the bladder wall (pT4b).. Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.. Distal margin: Negative for tumor.. Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor although not truly applicable given the resection of the adhered additional Organs. Distance of tumor from closest margin: 2.5 from one of the colonic margins Vascular invasion: Not identified. Regional lymph nodes (pN): 30 lymph nodes are dissected from the specimen and they are all negative for metastatic (pno). Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present in the soft tissue adhesing the small intestine and the bladder to the upper rectal/sigmoid colon resection. No discrete additional nodules of

pericolonic tumor seen. Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot evaluate pMx. Other findings: There is significant necrosis of the tumor in the central areas. B. Microscopic examination of the appendix reveals a benign mucocele at the tip. No dysplasia or malignancy is identified. There is focal fibrous obliteration of the tip. including obliteration of the diverticulum. There is acute serositis and ahdesions. 5x1, 2x1, 3260F DIAGNOSIS A. Sigmoid colon, upper rectum and adherent posterior bladder wall and small intestines, resection: Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumor invades through the entire colonic wall and through the. entire adhesed small intestinal wall into the mucosa of the. small intestine. Tumor invades into the muscularis propria. of the bladder (pT4b). Thirty lymph nodes are negative for metastatic tumor (0/30). (pNO). Resection margins are negative for tumor. B. Appendix, excision: Hyperplastic mucinous epithelium consistent with benign mucocele. . Resection margins are negative. Serosal adhesions. --- End Of Report ---
