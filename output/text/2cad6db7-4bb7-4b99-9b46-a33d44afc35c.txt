SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 11.  Urachus; excision: - Benign fibroadipose tissue. 12. Distal right ureter; excision: - Benign ureter. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes " and consists of two pink tan fatty lymph nodes (1.5 and 6.5 cm in greatest dimension) which are bisected and submitted for frozen section (FSA: one lymph.  node; FsB-FSD: one trisected lymph node). Possible smaller lymph nodes (0.5-0.8 cm) are identified and submitted for paraffin sections. Summary of sections: FSCA - frozen section control FSCB - frozen section control FSCC - frozen section control FSCD - frozen section control LN - lymph nodes 2). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "perivesical tissue, fresh and sterile" and consists of a single ovoid portion of pink-tan. to yellow-tan, lobulated fibroadipose tissue measuring 7 x 4 x 1.2 cm with no lymph nodes grossly identified. Representative. sections are submitted.. Summary of sections:  U -- undesignated 3). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes, fresh and sterile" and consists of three pink tan firm lymph. nodes ranging from 1 to 3.7 cm in greatest dimension.  All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN -- lymph node TLN -- trisected lymph node QLN -- quadrisected lymph node 4). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes, fresh and sterile" and consists of two pink tan firm lymph.  nodes measuring 1.9 and 2.9 cm in greatest dimension. All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections:. LN -- lymph node BLN -- bisected lymph node Page 3 of 7

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 5) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, urethra, perivesical tissue and lymph nodes". It. consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring 18.5 cm from superior to inferior, 7.5 cm laterally and 5.0 cm from anterior to posterior.  The left prostate is inked blue and the right prostate is inked green and the remainder of the specimen is inked magenta. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal two polypoid tumors measuring 2.5 x 1.9 x 1.2 cm (t1) and 1.4 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm (t2). T1 is grossly situated adjacent to the opening of the. prostatic urethra, 0.6 cm from the right ureter. T2 is grossly situated on the left side and is partially occluding the left ureteral orifice. Both ureters are probe patent measuring 0.6 (right) and 1.1 cm (left) in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal no invasion beyond the base of the polyp. Extension to the inked fat is grossly not identified. The remaining bladder mucosa is. ulceration and congestion at the trigone. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identified. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal multiple BPH nodules..  Representative sections are submitted including two sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted. Summary of sections: UTHM -- urethral margin RUM-- right ureter margin LUM -- left ureter margin T1RUO -- right ureter orifice T2LUO-- entire T2 and entire left ureteral orifice LP -- left posterior wall! LA -- left anterior wall RP -- right posterior wall RA-- right anterior wall TRI -- trigone DOM-- dome F -- perivesical fat RSV -- right seminal vesicle- LSV -- left seminal vesicle RAP -- right apex prostate LAP -- left apex prostate RAM -- right anterior mid prostate RPM -- right posterior mid prostate. LAM -- left anterior mid prostate LPM -- left posterior mid prostate RAB -- right anterior base prostate RPB -- right posterior base prostate LAB -- left anterior base prostate LPB -- left posterior base prostate 6). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 3.9 cm in greatest dimension.  All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN -- lymph nodes BLN-- bisected lymph nodes 7). The specimen is received fresh, labeled *right pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.  All identified lymph nodes are submitted. (The entire specimen is submitted) Summary of sections: LN -- lymph nodes BLN-- bisected lymph nodes Page 4 of 7

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 8). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left vas deferens" and consists of an unoriented segment of pink-tan tubular  tissue measuring 8.7 cm in length and 0.3 cm in maximum diameter, with scant yellow-tan soft tissue attached. On cut section, a pinpoint lumen is identified. No discrete abnormalities are grossly noted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted. Summary of sections: E - ends C - center 9). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Lipoma of left spermatic cord" and consists of a formed mass of yellow-tan Iobulated soft tissue measuring 6.2 x 3 x 0.9 cm. The external surface covered by a thin transparent membrane. Sectioning  reveals yellow-tan lobulated and grossly unremarkable soft tissue. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: U-undesignated 10). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right vas deferens" and consists of an unoriented segment of pink-tan tubular tissue measuring 4.7 cm in length and 0.3 cm in maximum diameter, with scant yellow-tan soft tissue attached. On cut section, a  pinpoint lumen is identified. No discrete abnormalities are grossly noted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted. Summary of sections: E - ends C - center 11). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Urachus" and consists of a piece of focally hemorrhagic fatty tissue measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.0 cm.  Sectioning reveals no definitive urachus.  The specimen is serially sectioned from end to end and is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: Ss -- serial sections 12). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal right ureter" and consists of a segment of ureter measuring 2.9 cm in length and 0.5 cm in maximum diameter, with attached adipose tissue.  A clip is identified at one end, which marks the proximal margin and is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a patent stellate lumen with no abnormalities grossly  noted. The specimen is serially sectioned from the unclipped to clipped end, and is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: C-clipped end, margin SS-serial sections clipped to opposite unclipped end. OE -- opposite unclipped end. Summary of Sections: Part 1:  SP: Right pelvic lymph nodes, excision (fs). Block Sect.
