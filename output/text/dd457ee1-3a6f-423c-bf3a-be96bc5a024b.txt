Distal pancreas, spleen (test for frozen margin on fhe staple line) Specimen: Tail of pancreas Spleen Procedure: Other: distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy Tumor Site: Pancreatic tail Tumor Size: Greatest dimension: 2.0 cm Additional dimension: 2.0 cm Histologic Type: Ductal adenocarcinoma Histologic Grade: G3: Poorly differentiated Microscopic Tumor Extension: Tumor is confined to pancreas Margins: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: 10 mm Margtis uninvolved by carcinoma in situ. Treatment Effect: No prior treatment Lymph-Vascular Invasion: Indeterminate Perineural Invasion: Present TNM Descriptors: Not applicable Primary Tumor (pT): pT2: Tumor limited to the pancreas, more than 2 cm in greatest dimension Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pN1: Regional lymph node metastasis. Number of lymph nodes examined: 1. Number of lymph nodes involved: 9. Distant Metastasis (pM): Not applicable Additional Pathologic Findings:  None identified Clinical History Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.. Specimen(s) Received A: Distal pancreas, spleen (test for frozen margin on fhe staple line) Gross Description The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "distal pancreas, spleen; test frozen margin on the staple line" and consists of a 482.5 grams distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy specimen including pancreas (14.5 x 6.0 x 2.6 cm) and spleen (17.0 x 12.0 x 5.2 cm). The anterior aspect of the pancreas is unremarkable. The posterior aspect of the pancreas has two white, plaque-like discolorations (1.6 x 1.5 cm and 2.0 x 2.0 cm). The smaller discolored area is located 5.9 cm from the neck edge. The cut surface of the pancreas has a firm, white and focally hemorrhagic mass, 8.0 cm (proximal to distal) by 2.5 cm (anterior to posterior) by 2.4 cm (width). The mass is located 1.0 cm from the neck edge and occludes the pancreatic duct in this area. The Printed by: Printed on: Page 2 of 4 (Continued)

The remaining cut surface of the pancreas is iobulated and unremarkable. The splenic capsule is intact and unremarkable. The cut surface of the spleen is unremarkable and uninvolved by mass. The splenic artery is uninvolved. yet adjacent to the mass. The neck margin is submitted for frozen section. Representative sections are submitted as stated below. Photographs are taken.
