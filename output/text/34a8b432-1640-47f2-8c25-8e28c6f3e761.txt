I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL).AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment RECUT Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled, "Para-aortic dissection superior margin", and consists. of a piece of cylindrical soft tissue measuring 1.1 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.It contains multiple metal clips. Cut section shows rubbery red-tan appearance. The specimen is entirely frozen. Summary of sections: FSC-frozen section control 2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, "Left kidney and para-aortic lymph nodes".  It consists of a kidney with.  surrounding perirenal adipose tissue and adrenal gland weighing 1900g and measuring 21.0 x 17.0 x 7.0 cm. The specimen is bivalved revealing a large yellow-red mass with focal areas of fibrosis measuring 17.5 x 17.0 x 7.0 cm.  It occupies a predominance of the kidney with only a small portion of uninvolved renal parenchyma present which measures 4.5 x 4.5 cm in maximal dimensions.  Serial sectioning of the mass reveals it to extend through the renal capsule but the mass appears still encapsulated itself.The tumor is serially sectioned revealing focal areas of yellow discoloration grossly consistent with. calcifications.The perirenal and peritumoral adipose tissue is serially sectioned revealing a V-shaped adrenal gland with. hemorrhage measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm.  The adrenal gland appears grossly free of tumor. The specimen includes a portion of. adipose tissue containing multiple red-tan lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. The 2.8 cm and 1.2 cm lymph node are both bisected All identified lymph nodes are submitted for histologic evaluation.  Representative portions of the. tumor are submitted fo Representative portions of the specimen are submitted for histologic evaluation. Summary of Sections: HM -- vascular hilar margins KID  kidney without tumor AD-adrenal gland BLN -- single bisected lymph node cassettes 14 and 15 LNS-additional lymph nodes BLN - single bisected lymph node cassette 17 T-tumor 3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, "Portion of ninth rib". It consists of a curvilinear fragment of rib measuring 15.0. cm in length x 1.0 cm in maximal diameter. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing essentially unremarkable rib. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted, pending decalcification.. Page 2 of 3

Summary of Sections: RIB -- ninth rib 4)  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled, "Interaortacaval lymph nodes". It consists of an irregularly shaped fragment of red-tan soft tissue and lymphoid tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.9 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing  multiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension.The specimen is entirely submitted.
