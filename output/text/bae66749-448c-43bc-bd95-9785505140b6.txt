Surgical Pathology -. Working Draft consists of a single soft, irregular, red-tan Part A, labeled candidate lymph node measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 1, and subsequently submitted in cassette A1. Part B, labeled "non-sentinel lymph node #2 right axilla," consists of a single soft, irregular, red-tan candidate lymph node measuring 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in cassette B1. consists of a single soft,. Part C, labeled irregular piece of red-yellow, fatty tissue measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.4 cm. Fatty tissue is trimmed away, and a single candidate lymph node is found. The candidate lymph node is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis 3, and subsequently submitted in cassette C1. The remaining unused fatty tissue is entirely submitted in cassette C2. consists of one soft and firm, Part D, received in formalin and Iabeled tan-yellow, fatty tissue fragment measuring 1.7 x  x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette D1. consists of one soft and firm, Part E, received in formalin and labeled tan-yellow, fatty tissue fragment measuring 1.6 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette E1. It consists of a 9-gm. Part F is received in formalin and additionally labeled breast lumpectomy specimen, measuring 1.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 5 cm from superior to inferior, and 3.5 cm from lateral to medial. There is a short stitch designated as superior and a long stitch designated as lateral. The specimen is Inked as follows: anterior superior blue, anterior inferior the posterior portion of the green, and posterior black. Prior to receipt by me (Dr. breast has been incised and tissue removed for tissue banking. The specimen is serially sectioned, from medial to lateral, into eight slices and reveals a well-circumscribed, tan, firm nodule (1.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm) in slices 3 through 6. The tumor nodule is located approximately 1 cm from both the latera!- and medial-most margins, 0.7 cm from the superior margin, and 1.3 cm from the inferlor margin. The closest approach to a margin is in slice 6, where it appears to abut the anterior-mid portion of the specimen (<1 mm grossly from the blue/green-inked margin). The specimen is entireiy submitted as follows: Cassette F1: Medial-most margin.. Cassette F2: Slice 2, superior. Cassette F3: Slice 2, inferior. Cassette F4: Slice 3, superior (and nodule). Cassette F5: Slice 3, inferior. Cassette F6: Slice 4, superior (and nodute). Cassette F7: Slice 4, inferior. Cassette F8: Slice 5, superior (and nodule). Cassette F9: Slice 5, inferior. Cassette F10: Slice 6, superior (and nodule). Cassette F11: Slice 6, inferlor. Cassette F12: Slice 7, superior. Cassette F13: Slice 7, inferior. Cassettes F14-F15: Lateral-most margin. Co nsists of multiple soft and firm, Part G, received in formalin and labeled brown-tan and yellow tissue fragments measuring 7 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. The specimen is trimmed and extensively searched for lymph nodes. Multiple candidate lymph nodes are found and submitted intact in cassettes G1-G5.. Signed: Fee Codes: Page 3 of 8

Surgical Pathology. Working Draft Addenda Addendum. Date Ordered:. Status:  Signed Out Date Complete:. By: Date Reported:. Addendum Comment An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block F6. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in ~50% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is weak to moderate nuclear staining in ~15% Of tumor cells. Resuit of HeR2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HEr2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohlstochemical assay was performed on block F6 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3.. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of O or 1 are consldered negative tor over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submtted for FiSH testing. The results of the FIsH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics taboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correiation between the results of Immunohistochemical and Fish testing, and almost always show gene amplification. The immunnnernvirase stain(s) reoorted above were developed and thelr performance characteristics determined by the The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinica! purposes. They should not be regarded as Investigationai or for research.

Addendum Comment An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HEr-2-neu was. performed on the material submitted for cell block.. The test for estrogen receptors is positive . There is strong nuclear staining in greater than 9o% of. tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is Negative. There is no nuclear staining in 1oo% of tumor cells. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression on a scant specimen. Repeat testing is recommended on the excisional specimen. An immunohistochemicai assay was performed on the cell button using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3.. Carcinomas with staining Intensity scores of O or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HeR2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a stalning intensity score of 2 are consldered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining Intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FIsH testing. The results of the FisH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory.
