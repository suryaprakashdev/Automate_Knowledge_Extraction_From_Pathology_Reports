RIGHT BREAST @ B. LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS Sih: busst, Nos cso.9 C. HIGHEST LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE 1c1>rf GROSS DESCRIPTION RECEIVED IN 3 PARTS. PART A RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT BREAST STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK, IS A 1435.5 GRAM MASTECTOMY.  SECTIONING REVEALS THE MAJORITY OF THE SPECIMEN TO CONSIST OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE WITH FINE FIBROUS BANDS.  CENTRALLY, THE FIBROUS BANDS BECOME BROADER BUT NO MASSES ARE IDENTIFIED.  REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A1--NIPPLE, A2--CENTRAL DEEP MARGIN, A3 AND 4--UPPER INNER QUADRANT, A5 AND 6--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, A7 AND 8--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT, A9 AND 10-~LOWER INNER QUADRANT.S NOTE:  MIRROR IMAGE SECTIONS FROM THE NIPPLE AND RANDOM QUADRANT SECTIONS (Al, A3, A5, A7, AND A9) ARE SUBMITTED PER CLINICAL BREAST CARE PROJECT RESEARCH PROTOCOL, FROZEN IN PART B RECEIVED LABELED LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS DOUBLE STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK LONG STITCH AT AXILLARY CONTENTS, IS A 217O GRAM LEFT MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN WHICH MEASURES 34.5 CM FROM MEDIAL TO LATERAL, 24 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, AND UP TO 6.5 CM FROM ANTERIOR TO THE DEEP MARGIN. THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 30 X 15 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. A SUTURE DENOTES 12 O'CLOCK.  THERE IS A MASS PALPABLE AT THE 3 O'CLOCK AND 12 O'CLOCK POSITIONS AND A MASS PALPABLE TOWARDS THE AXILLARY TAIL.  THE ANTERIOR MARGIN IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP IS MARKED WITH BLACK. THE AXILLARY TAIL IS REMOVED AND WHERE IT IS CUT FROM THE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN, THE MARGIN IS MARKED WITH RED INK

(Continued). Specimen: Received: Status: Req#: Collected: Sp type: SURGICAL P Subm Dr: M.D. GROSS DESCRIPTION (Continued) AND DOES NOT REPRESENT TRUE MARGIN.  IN THE LOW AXILLARY TAIL, THERE IS A 3.5 X 3.2 X 2.3 CM LYMPH NODE. A RIBBON CLIP IS IDENTIFIED. A CENTRAL CROSS-SECTION IS SUBMITTED IN B2 AND 3. SECTIONING REVEALS 4 MASSES WITHIN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT BETWEEN 3O0 AND 12OO. THE MOST LATERAL AT 3 O'CLOCK IS A SMALL IRREGULAR AREA MEASURING 1 X 0.8 X O.6 CM. THIS IS O5-CM-FROM-THE-DEEP-MARGIN-AND-IS-DEEP-TO THE LATERAL EDGE-OE-THE SECOND MASS GROSSLY SEPARATED BY 2 CM. THE SECOND MASS MEASURES 3.5 X 2.7 X 3.5 CM FRCM MEDIAL TO LATERAL. THE SECOND MASS IS INFERIOR TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH MASSES WHICH ARE AT 12 O'CLOCK.THE DEEPEST IS A 1.6 X 1.3 X 1 CM MASS GROSSLY 2 CM DEEP TO THE FOURTH MASS WHICH MEASURES 4 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, 3 CM FROM ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR, AND 4 CM FROM MEDIAL TO LATERAL.  THE DEEPEST OF THESE LESIONS IS 2 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. THIS LAST LESION IS 1.5 CM BENEATH THE SKIN. THE REMAINING BREAST TISSUE CONSISTS OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE. THE 2 LARGEST MASSES, ALTHOUGH GROSSLY SEPARATE, APPEAR TO ABUT EACH OTHER AND ANTERIOR TO THIS AREA IS AN ADDITIONAL O.6 CM IN DIAMETER MASS (B4). A RIBBON CLIP IS FOUND AT THE INFERIOR EDGE OF MASS 2. A COIL CLIP IS ALSO IDENTIFIED WITHIN MASS 2. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: B1--NIPPLE, B2 AND 3--LOW AXILLARY LYMPH NODE, B4--SMALL LESION ANTERIOR TO THE AREA OF THE 2 LARGER MASSES, B5--THE TISSUE ADJACENT MEDIALLY TO THE SECOND-DESCRIBED MASS AND INFERIOR TO THE FOURTH-DESCRIBED MASS, B6--DEEP MARGIN TO MASS 1 AND 2, B7--MASS 1, B8--AREA BETWEEN MASS 1 AND MASS 2, B9 AND 1O--FULL CROSS-SECTION OF MASS 2, B11--THE MOST MEDIAL EDGE OF MASS 2, B12--THE MOST LATERAL EDGE OF TUMOR 2, B13--DEEP MARGIN TO MASS 3 AND 4, B14--TISSUE BETWEEN MASS 3 AND MASS 4 WITH THE RED INK ALONG THE EDGE ADJACENT TO MASS 4, B15--MASS 3 WITH ADJACENT SMALL NODULE, B16 THROUGH 18--A LONGITUDINAL SECTION THROUGH MASS 4 FROM SUPERIOR TO INEERIOR, B19--THE MOST LATERAL AREA OF MASS 4, B2O--THE MOST MEDIAL ASPECT OF MASS 4, B21--THE ANTERIOR MARGIN TO MASS 4 SUPERIOR TO THE SKIN ELLIPSE. NOTE: SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED FROZEN IN PER THE CLINICAL BREAST CARE PROJECT RESEARCH PROTOCOL WITH A MIRROR IMAGE OF THE NIPPLE AND RANDOM QUADRANT SECTIONS (B1 AND B22-B25).  IN ADDITION, SECTIONS OF THE LARGE LYMPH NODE #1 ARE SUBMITTED AS P1-2 WITH TISSUE ALSO FROZEN IN TISSUE FROM THE FIRST TUMOR (B7) IS SUBMITTED AS P3, OF THE SECOND TUMOR AS P4-5 AND PIO WITH TISSUE ALSO FROZEN IN  OF THE THIRD TUMOR AS P6 AND THE FOURTH TUMOR AS P7 THROUGH P9 WITH ADDITIONAL TISSUE FROZEN IN TISSUE TAKEN BETWEEN MASS 3 AND 4 (B14) IS SUBMITTED AS P11. FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE AXILLARY TAIL REVEALS 6 ADDITIONAL LYMPH NODES, ONE OF WHICH IS GROSSLY POSITIVE. FOLLOWS: B26--GROSSLY POSITIVE NODE BISECTED, B27--1 NODE BISECTED, B28~-1 VERY SMALL NODE BISECTED, B29--2 NODES, B30 THROUGH B32--1 NODE
