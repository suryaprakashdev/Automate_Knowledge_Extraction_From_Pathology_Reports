Tumour and exudative detachment.. Largest diameter 11.34mm. Thickness 7.6mm. Post ora. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION An intact right eye. Dimensions: Axial 24.5mm, Horizontal 23mm, Vertical 23mm Cornea: Horizontal 12mm, Vertical 1lmm. Optic nerve Length 4mm, Diameter 4mm Pupil: regular, normal depth. On trans-illumination, a dark shadow seen inferior posteriorly measuring approximately 13 x 10mm, and 5mm from. optic disc. Plane of section: vertical. Intraocular description: On opening, a dome shaped tumour is seen, pale and fragmented. Height 7mm LBD 12mm MICROSCOPY Sections show a focally pigmented choroidal melanoma with attached adjacent normal  choroid and sclera and associated with exudative / haemorrhagic retinal detachment. The tumour. consists predominantly of spindle cells. The number of Reported:. Pathologist: Electronically Verifled:

The loops are not present in the planes of section. The lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is minimal. Tumour necrosis is not seen. There is focal tumour extension into the sclera through a vascular channel. No evidence of tumour veins examined. Tumour cells are not seen at the resection margins. Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is deep. The iris shows no significant abnormality but the ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of ciliary processes. The lens shows subcapsular degenerative changes. Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic and Bruch's membrane appears breached in the sections examined. DIAGNOSIS Right eye, enucleation: Choroidal melanoma of predominant spindle cell type. COMENT Immunohistochemistry for assessment of expression of Melan-A and Hsp27 by tumour cells will be performed. Molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the tumour celis will be also carried out using multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLpA). looking at chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8.~A supplementary report will follow in due course. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed using the technigue termed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLpA). These investigations were performed in the Reported: Pathologist: Electronlcally Verified:

The DNA concentration was measured using : and the quality assessed using multiplex-pcr prior to the MLPA reaction. The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on assessment. The MLpA reaction was run at least twice on. differing occasions, resulting in similar results.. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLpA products is printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated: 4 borderline losses on chromosome 1, 7 borderline losses in chromosome 3 (equating to chromosome 3 loss), gains of chromosome 6p, and gains of chromosome 8q.. These molecular data require correlation with the clinical and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment. SUPPLEMENTARY AND FINAL REPORTS In the meantime immunohistochemistry was performed: the. tumour cells demonstrate positivity for MelanA, BAP1. (cytoplasmic only). and Hsp-27 (score 3).
