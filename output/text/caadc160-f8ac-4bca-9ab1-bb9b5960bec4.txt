UUID:94F7B032-1181-44E0-AB16-4A672A88E086 TCGA-AY-A69D-01A-PR Redacted SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Case Number : Diagnosis: A: Colon, transverse, partial colectomy. Tumor Histologic Type: invasive adenocarcinoma. Histologic Grade: moderately differentiated (grade 2 of 4) Tumor Location: transverse colon. Depth of Invasion:. -Through muscularis propria and into the subserosa and pericolic soft tissue ICD-o3 Lymphovascular Invasion: not identified dnscarersmo fUSS 8140/3 Perineural Invasion: not identified Site Ironewuae colen Cl8.4 Margins: Oj sle/1 3 Proximal margin: negative Distal margin: negative Mesenteric margin: negative Distance of carcinoma from closest margin (specify): 6.6 cm to the closest distal margin of resection Regional Lymph Nodes:. Total number with metastasis: 0 Total number examined: 25 Additional Pathologic Findings: Immunohistochemical stains for MLH-1, Msh-2, PsH-6 and pMs-2 are performed on block A7. The tumor cells demonstrate appropriate positive nuclear expression for all four markers. This is the normal phenotype and does NoT support a diagnosis of. microsatellite instability/hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (Hnpcc). Separate molecular testing for microsatellite instability markers will be performed and reported separately.. Appropriate controls are performed.. AJCc Pathologic TNM Stage: pT3 pNO Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change. pending clinical review and additional information..

Clinical History: -year-old female with colon cancer. Gross Description: Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally labeled "transverse colon and omentum." It consists of a 23.5 cm long x 5.2 cm in circumference segment of large bowel with attached omentum (30.4 x 15.6 x 0.8 cm), pericolonic adipose tissue up to 4.3 cm thick and appendix is absent. There is a 5.2 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm (protruding into lumen) firm, pink/tan, centrally ulcerated circumferential mass with raised borders that is 10.7 cm from the proximal margin and 6.6 cm from the distal margin. The distal margin has an attached suture, which is inked blue and the serosa overlying the mass is inked black. The mass on cut section is firm, smooth, gray/white, extends 1.1 cm through the wall and into the mesentery focally retracting the serosa but not extending through it, and 3.5 cm from the mesenteric margin. The uninvolved mucosa is tan with normal folding pattern. The omentum has patchy areas of hemorrhage but nodules are absent. The pericolonic adipose tissue is dissected for lymph node candidates of which 29 are identified ranging from 0.2 cm in greatest dimension up to 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. Block summary: Al - mesenteric margin, en face A2-A3 - proximal mucosal margin, en face A4-A5 - distal mucosal margin, en face A6 - mass retracting the serosa A7-A8 - each contains deepest extension of mass with positive lymph node in A8 A9 - mass with distal mucosa Al0 - mass with proximal mucosa Al1 - omentum A12-Al4 - each contains six lymph node candidates A15-A16 - each contains four lymph node candidates A17 - two lymph node candidates, each bisected, one is inked black A18-A19 - one lymph node candidate, serially sectioned Tumor and normal are given to
