DIAGNOSIS D. Skin, lip, blopsy: Benign solar lentigo (pigmentod actinlc keratosis). Electronic Signature: CLINICAL INFORMATION CLINICAL HISTORy: Preoperative Diagnosis: Lef breast cancer Postoperative Diagnosis: Symptoms/Radiologic Findings:e SPECIMENS: A. Left sentinel lymph node FS. B. Left breast tissue C. Left lymph nodes D. Seborrhelc keratosis of lip. Gross DescrIpTIon: A. Container A is labalod.. .r, A and consisls of a tan-yellow firm fatty nodule, 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is trisected  and entirety submitted for frozen section in one cassette labeled 8. Container B is labeled r, B and consists of a 255 gram portion of lent breast tissue, 14.0 x 11.0 x 6.0 cn with attached tan-gray ellipso of skin. 5.0 x 4.2 cm displaying a centrally located fiattened nipple, 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. The doep margin Is inked and the specimen is sectioned to reveal predominately tan-yellow lobular adlpose tissue intermixed with moderate amounts of tan-gray dense fibrous tissue. A gray-white stellate gritty  mass is notod in the upper outer quadrant and is 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. Samples of this mass have been submitted for genomic Studies. This mass is located 2.0 cm fron tho skin surface and 1.5 cm from the deep margin. No other leslons are grossty noted. The lateral margin  displays a gray-white minute nodule possibly representing lymph node, 0.2 cm.
