SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "SLN #1" is a 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5-cm lymph node; sectioned, a touch prep is performed, and lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette A1. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "SLN #2" is a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm lymph node; sectioned, touch prep is performed, submitted entirely in cassette B1.. C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "SLN #3" is a 1 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm lymph node; sectioned, a touch prep is performed, and lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette C1.. D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #4 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "SLN #4" are 4 lymph nodes, 0.4 x 0.4 x 0 .2 cm, 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, 0.3 x 0.2 x 0 .2 cm, and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm; 4 touch preps are performed, and lymph nodes are submitted respectively and entirely in cassettes D1-D4.. E. LEFT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast" is an oriented 574 g, 24 x 19 x 4.5 cm mastectomy with 10.5 x 4 cm skin ellipse and 1.3-cm everted nipple. Ink code: Anterior/superior-blue,.  anterior/inferior-orange, and posterior-black. Specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 10 slices with nipple in slice 7 revealing: 1) 3.5 x 3.4 x 2.2 cm area of hemorrhage and containing a biopsy site in the lower outer quadrant to the lower mid. section in slices 4-6 at is closest to the anterior margin at 2.3 cm  2) 5.5 cm superior to the biopsy site, in slice 6, is a 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm irregularly shaped firm tan mass in the upper inner quadrant that is closest to the anterior margin at 0.2 cm Within the axillary region is a 1 cm firm tan lymph node. Representatively submitted:. E1: slice 4, LOQ granular region lateral to biopsy site. E2: slice 5, most lateral aspect of area of hemorrhage and biopsy site. E3: slice 6, most inferior aspect of biopsy site extending to the anterior margin/skin. E4: slice 6, most inferior aspect of biopsy site extending to the posterior margin E5: slice 6, mid anterior region of biopsy site E6: slice 6, mid posterior region of biopsy site E7-E8: slice 6, fibrous tissue connecting biopsy site of lesion E9-E11: slice 6, upper inner quadrant mass including posterior margin (trisected) E12: slice 7, fibrous tissue medial to biopsy site E13: slice 7, fibrous tissue medial to mass E14: slice 10, LIQ E15: slice 9, UIQ E16: slice 3, UOQ E17: slice 2, LOQ E18-E19: nipple, perpendicular sections E20: skin and bisected lymph node.

NOTE: Two lesions are grossly identified, both located in slice #6 (outer quadrants/central). The upper lesion is DCIS extending from slice #4 to slice #6, measuring approximately 3-cm. The second lesion is located centrally showing invasive ductal carcinoma, measuring 1.7-cm. The tissue sections between two lesions (slides #7 and #8)  show no invasive or in situ ductal carcinoma.
