See comment. - Largest tumor nodule: 1.5 cm in diameter (6 o'clock aspect). - Two smaller nodules: 0.6 and 0.8 cm (7-8 o'clock aspect). - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DciS), high nuclear grade, solid type. - DCIS comprises less than 10% of biopsy tissue volume, and is associated with all three invasive tumor nodules. - Mastectomy margins are free of tumor.. - Carcinoma is 3 cm from the inferior margin and is at least 6 cm from all other margins.. - Metastatic carcinoma in three of fifteen lymph nodes (3/15). - Largest metastatic focus: 0.9 cm in diameter. - Extranodal extension present.. - Positive lymph nodes are sentinel lymph nodes #2, #3, and #4 PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SYNOPSIS: Type and grade (invasive): Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2-3. Type and grade (in situ): Dcis, high-nuclear grade.. LQD o 3 Primary tumor: pT1c(m). Regional Iymph nodes: pN1c. 'arersmo,iryiltatiy oluct NoS Distant metastasis: Not applicable.. 8s00/3 Stage: IIA. Lymphovascular invasion: Indeterminate.. c 50.9 Margin status: Negative.. Q4I id/4ll3 COMMENT: The three foci of invasive carcinoma have similar histologic features, although the tumor grade is somewhat variable in the largest tumor nodule, where there is a variable rate of mitosis, and nuclear pleomorphism ranging from intermediate to high-grade. The smaller tumor nodules contain high-grade malignant Case #: Page 1 Printed: This report continues... (FiNAL) MR No. Acct No. - Patient Name  Pathology - Page 1/6. Page 1 Doc#1

Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT epithelial cells arranged in solid sheets with frequent mitoses, compatible with Nottingham grade 3. There is enough morphologic similarity between three nodules to suggest that they have a common origin. Intradepartmental consultation: concurs with this impression.
