 RUN DATE RUN TIME PAGE 3 RUN USER SPEC #: (Continued) COmmENT(S) (Continued) In situ hybridization (Fish): not amplified GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for tissue banking labeled with the patient's name and "right breast" is a. 257 gram. 18.0 x 16.0 x 3.0 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast has an overlying 16.0 x 12.0 cm tan-white skin ellipse with an eccentric 3.0 cm areolar and flattened 1.0 cm nipple. No scars are identified on the skin surface. The specimen is oriented with a suture at the axillary tail. The deep margin has a smooth fascial plane with no significant strands of fibroskeletal muscle. The breast is consistent with a simple mastectomy spacimen. The deop margin is inked blue. and the breast is serially sectioned from lateral to medial to have a central. lobulated. dense indurated tumor mass with fibrous septae. The mass. focally ranges up to 3.9 cm and is 3.9 x 3.6 x 2.6 cm. Tho tumor is 0.2 cm from the deep margin, and the deep margin appears to slide freely over the tumor mass. The mass is 2.3 cm from the superior margin. is 5.8 cm from inferior. is 5.6 cm from lateral and 7.4 cm from medial. There is diffuse surrounding dense white fibrous tissue. closely associated with the upper outer quadrant. Ths dense white fibrous tissue makes up The tumor is most. approximately 60% of the parenchyma. A section of the tumor is sampled for tissue banking. No additional lesions are identified. Representative sections are sampled as labeled:. 1 perpendicular section of nipple 2-3 tumor to nearest deep margin 4 additional section of tumor 5 upper outer quadrant sampled (quadrant nearest tumor) 6 lower outer quadrant sampled 7 upper inner quadrant sampled 8 lower inner quadrant sampled INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION (RIGHT BREAST) : INVASIVE CARCINOMA. PROCESSED FOR TUMOR BANKING SURGICAL MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR PHOTO IOXUMENTATION Image Signed (signature on file). ** END OF REPORT ** Criter 1233
