PATHOLOGIC STAGE Summary Final TNM: pT2aN0M0 2010 stage: I Attending Pathologist: CLINICAL INFORMATION Bladder cancer SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION A) SOURCE: Bladder and prostate The specimen is received fresh labeled "bladder and prostate." It consists of an 8 x 7.5 x 5 cm bladder. There is 3 cm of attached right ureter. The ureter appears dilated with a diameter of 0.6 cm. It is obstructed. The ureteral margin (not a true margin) is sectioned and submitted en face. There is 6 cm of attached left ureter. This ureter is patent and measures 0.4 cm in diameter. The ureteral (not a true margin) is sectioned and submitted en face. The attached prostate measures 4 (r-l) x 2.9 (anterior-posterior) x 2.6 (apex-base) cm. The right seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1 x 0.7 cm. The right vas deferens measures 8 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in diameter. The left vas deferens measures 5 cm in length and up to 0.2 cm in diameter. The right half of the specimen is inked green, the left half Jinked blue and the posterior aspect inked black.. The distal urethral margin is sectioned in a radial fashion and entirely submitted for frozen labeled FS1 and FS2.. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Urethral margin negative" is rendered by! The specimen is opened along the anterior aspect. There is a 7 x 4.1 x 1 cm partially endophytic, partially exophytic mass. The mass is found within the trigone and extends up to a portion of the posterior wall, right Iateral wall and right aspect of the anterior wall. It extends to within 1.5 cm of the distal urethral margins. It appears to obstruct the right ureteral orifice. It is found 1.3 cm from the left ureteral orifice. A representative section of the tumor is sectioned and frozen for possible ancillary studies. It is sectioned. It extends into the bladder wall for a maximum depth of 2.1 cm. The bladder wall measures 2.2 cm and the tumor extends to within 0.1 cm of the right lateral soft tissue margin. The cut surface is tan and firm.. The remaining urothelium is moderately hyperemic and coarsely wrinkled. No additional lesions are noted. The prostate is serially sectioned. The cut surfaces are mottled tan-pink. No obvious tumor is appreciated. The seminal vesicles are sectioned and are grossly unremarkable. The vasa deferentia are sectioned revealing pinpoint unremarkable lumina. A gross photo is taken.. There are no palpable lymph nodes in the attached fat. Representative sections are submitted in 29 cassettes labeled: 1-2.  Frozen section residue, distal urethral margin, sectioned in a radial fashion

Portion of possible right prostate and bladder tumor 28. Portion of left prostate 29. Portion of possible left prostate (includes portion of bladder and tumor) B) SOURCE: Distal right ureter Labeled "right distal ureter' is a 0.6 cm in length cylindrical portion of tissue measuring 0.8 cm in diameter. It is submitted as received in one chuck for frozen section diagnosis.. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Negative" is rendered by C) SOURCE: Left distal ureter Labeled "left distal ureter' is a tan-pink cylindrical 0.6 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter portion of tissue. It is entirely submitted on for frozen section diagnosis INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Negative" is rendered by D) SOURCE: Lymph nodes, right pelvic. Labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" are several yellow-tan ragged fatty tissues aggregating 5 x 4 x 1 cm. Five lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.4-2.8 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are submitted in four cassettes as follows:  Three nodes 2.  One node 3.4. One node E) SOURCE: Lymph nodes, left pelvic. Labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a 3 x 2 x 2 cm portion of yellow-tan ragged fatty tissue. Four lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.9-3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are submitted in five cassettes as follows: 1. One node 2-3. One node 4. One node

5. One node F) SOURCE: Appendix Labeled "appendix" is an intact vermiform appendix measuring 2.8 cm in. length averaging 0.5 cm in diameter with attached mesoappendiceal fat  measuring 2 x 0.5 cm. The serosal surface is pink-tan and smooth with an. unremarkable lumen without masses, perforations or fecaliths identified.. Representative sections to include the proximal margin (inked) are. submitted in a single cassette.
