Gross Description Received fresh labeled "right hemicolectomy" is a previously unopened 40 cm segment of proximal right colon with attached 15 cm of distal ileum and an abundant amount of attached mesocolon, mesentery, and omentum. An unremarkable 9 cm appendix averaging 0.5 cm in diameter is present.  The proximal and distal margins measure 5.2 and 7.8 cm in circumference respectively.. On opening, there is a circumferential,. 6.0 x 3.9 cm rubbery tan-white-red tumor mass which is 8 cm from the distal margin.. On sectioning,.  the tumor has a maximal thickness of 2. cm, grossly extending through the muscularis and into the attached mesocolon.  The tumor is present within 0.2 cm of the inked free radial serosal surface and visually appears to extend into the attached omentum. A 3 cm in greatest dimension area of tan red discoloration is noted within the distal ileum, 5 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve.. The remaining ileal and colonic mucosa is unremarkable tan-pink with regular folds and the walls average 0.5 cm..  A portion of tumor and a as requested.  Multiple soft to slightly rubbery tan-pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm are recovered from the attached mesocolon and mesentery.. RS 21 Summary: 1 - margins, 2 through 4 - tumor to inked free radial serosal surface (cassettes 3 and 4 including attached omentum), 5 and 6 - central tumor, 7 - discolored area of ileum, 8 - Icv, 9 and 10 the nodes per cassette,  19 - 6 lymph nodes, 20 and 21 - 1 bisected lymph node per cassette. lw 3/s|3
