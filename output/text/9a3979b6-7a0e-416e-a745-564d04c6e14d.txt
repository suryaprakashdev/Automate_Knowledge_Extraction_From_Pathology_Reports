SURGICAL PATHOL Report Operation Performed Left breast lumpectomy: left breast lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy, axillary node dissection Pre Qperative Diagnosis: Breast cancer Specimen(s) Received: A: Sentinel node #1 FS B: Suspicious node FS C: Sentinel node #3, internal mammary (permanent) D: Left breast lumpectomy Gross Description:. A.  Received fresh there is a 1 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm lymph node. Bisected and submitted in toto for frozen section in tvo cassettes. B. Received fresh there is a 2 x 1 x 0.3 cm lymph node. Bisected and submitted in toto in two cassettes for froten section. C. Received in formalin there is a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm lymph node. Submitted in toto. D. Received in formalin there is a lumpectomy specimen of 5 x 4 x 3.5 cm and 40 grams. Specimen is oriented with short stitch in the superior margin and a long stitch in the lateral margin. Specimen is inked as follows: blue superor, green inferior. yellow anterior, black posterior, red medial, and orange lateral. There is a palpable indurated pale tan mass of 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm. Closest resection margin is the posterior margin at 0.2 cm. Superior margin are 0.7, infelior margin at 1 cm, lateral margin at 2.5 cm, and medial margin at 1.5 cm. There are no additional lesions in the remainder of the parenchyma. Fat to stroma ratio is 40:60.
