Clinical Diagnosis & History: year old female with stage Iv breast carcinoma, debulking surgery. Specimens Submitted: 1: sp: Right breast and axillary contents level 1. DIAGNOSIS: 1. BREAST, RIGHT; MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY:S - INVASIVE CARCINOMA, HISTOLOGIC GRADE II/III (MODERATE TUBULE FORMATION) TO HISTOLOGIC GRADE III/III (SLIGHT OR NO TUBULE FORMATION). NUCLEAR GRADE III/III (MARKED VARIATION IN SIZE AND SHAPE), MEASURING AT LEAST IO CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION GROSSLY. INVASIVE CARCINOMA SHOWS MICROPAPILLARY FEATURES. FOCAL EXTRACELLULAR MUCIN IS ALSO NOTED. - DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) IS ALSO IDENTIFIED, SOLID CRIBRIFORM MICROPAPILLARY AND FLAT TYPES, WITH HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, AND EXTENSIVE NEcROSIS. - LOBULAR INVOLVEMENT BY DCIS IS PRESENT.S UUID:5EFC16F4-7FC7-479E-93F7-AEDC2D350A22 - THE DCIS CONSTITUTES LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 25% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR MASS, TCGA-A0-A035-01A-PR Redacted AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH AND AWAY FROM THE INVASIVE COMPONENT. - THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS LOCATED IN ALL FOUR QUADRANTS. - THE DCIS IS LOCATED IN ALL FOUR QUADRANTS. -THE NIPPLE IS INVOLVED BY INVASIVE CARCINOMA. - CALCIFICATIONS ARE PRESENT IN BOTH THE IN SITU AND INVASIVE CARCINOMA. - VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.S - THE SKIN IS INVOLVED BY INVASIVE CARCINOMA BY DIRECT EXTENSION INTO THE DERMIS. - THE ATTACHED SKELETAL MUSCLE IS EXTENSIVELY INVOLVED BY INVASIVE CARCINOMA BY DIRECT EXTENSION. - INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS CLOSE (LESS THAN O.1 CM) FROM THE NEAREST DEEP MARGIN. - THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE IS UNREMARKABLE.S - FOCAL CHANGES OF PRIOR PROCEDURE ARE NOTED IN THE AXILLARY TAIL. - METASTATIC CARCINOMA IS PRESENT IN TWO OUT OF TWO LEVEL I LYMPH NODES (2/2). ADDITIONAL SECTIONS OF THE AXILLARY TISSUE HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND THE FINDINGS WILL BE REPORTED IN AN ADDENDUM. - NUMEROUS FOCI OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA ARE NOTED IN THE AXILLARY SOFT TISSUE, WITH THE LARGEST MEASURING AT LEAST 1.4 CM. ** Continued on next page ** tc-u-3 85 a3J3 Site: brsat, nos c50.9 h if3#f1

Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed tissue with. the following results for invasive carcinoma (block 1-8): ESTROGEN RECEPTOR intensity. Progesteronr prrrdtor HER2 90% nuclear staining with strong (5% of invasive tumor cells exhibit complete membranous staining; Uniformity of staining: absent; Equivocal (focal 2+). FIsh will be performed. Negative (no nuclear staining) Homogeneous, dark circumferential pattern: absent) The carcinoma is positive for E-cadherin, supporting lobular differentiation. Comment: an FDA-approved rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (clone 4bs) directed Controls are satisfactory. Ventana' s PAThwAy anti-HER-2/neu is against the internal domain of the c-erbb-2 oncoprotein (Her2) for immunohistochemical detection of HeR2 protein overexpression in breast cancer tissue routinely processed for histologic evaluation. The HeR2 test results are reported in accordance with the Asco/cAp guideline recommendations for HeR2 testing in breast cancer (J Clin Oncol 2007; 25(1) :118-145). approved. The ER and pR rabbit monoclonal antibodies are also FDA Some of the immnohistochemistry and Ish tests were developad and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the us Food and Drug Administration. The FpA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA : 88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. ** Report Blectronically Signed Out *** Gross Description: 2 M.D. 1) The specimen is received fresh labeled, *right breast and axillary. contents level 1*, ! axillary contents.
