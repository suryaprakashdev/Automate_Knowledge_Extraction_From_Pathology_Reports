Pathology Report:. Surgical Pathology Report FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS A. Right chest wall mass; biopsy: - Skeletal muscle and fibroadipose tissue with reactive changes and acute and chronic inflammation. B. R4 lymph node; biopsy:. - Two lymph nodes, no tumor. C. Number 7 lymph node; biopsy: - Seventeen lymph nodes, no tumor. D. Pleural peel; resection:. - Malignant biphasic tumor most consistent with biphasic mesothelioma. Thoracic Mesothelioma Pathologic Parameters Pleura/Pericardium, Resection MACROSCOPIC Specimen Type: Pleural resection Tumor Site: Right pleura Tumor Configuration and Size: Diffuse, maximum thickness: 18.5 cm MICROSCOPIC Histologic Type: Biphasic mesothelioma (90% sarcomatoid, 10% epithelioid Tumor Extension Into but not through diaphragm Endothoracic fascia Venous/Lymphatic (Large/Small Vessel) Invasion (V/L): Absent Margins: Cannot be assessed *Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT3, N0 Primary Tumor (pT): pT3: Tumor (locally advanced but potentially resectable) involves any of the ipsilateral pleural surfaces, with at least 1of the following: invasion of the endothoracic fascia, invasion into mediastinal fat, solitary completely resectable focus of tumor invading the soft tissues of the chest wall, non-transmural involvement of the pericardium

Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pN0: No regional lymph node metastasis *Effective January 1, 2010 this Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging. system for pleural mesothelioma of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC). Comment This is a biphasic tumor. The majority of the stromal component is highly. cellular with spindle-type hyperchromatic cells that frequently overlap with one another. There is focally more fibrotic stroma. The spindle cell component extends into polypoid masses that are covered with single layer of epithelioid. cells. The epithelioid cells are cuboidal to columnar with well-defined cell borders and clear-to-eosinophilic cytoplasm. This is not classic for mesothelioma. Therefore the differential diagnosis including synovial sarcoma solitary fibrous tumor, carcinosarcoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma and malignant peripheral nerve cell tumor was considered. Immunohistochemistry (controls appropriate): Epithelioid component and focally the sarcomatoid component are positive for calretinin, WT-1, cytokeratin. (CAM 5.2), EMA, CAIX, Bcl2, D2-40, CK5/6. Sarcomatoid component is focally positive for SMA with very weak focal positivity for TLE-1. There is very focal epithelial positivity for MOC31. Tumor is negative for MIC2, Chromogranin, Pax8,. Desmin, BerEP4, CEA, Beta-Catenin, Synaptophysin, TTF-1, CD34 and S-100. Because the morphology is suggestive of synovial sarcoma, the specimen was. sent for genetic testing for t(x,18) which was negative. The official report is included below.. Overall, although the morphology is slightly unusual for mesothelioma, and. the loss of keratin staining in a large part of the sarcomatoid tumor is also unusual, positivity for other mesothelial markers (calretinin, WT-1, CAIX, and. D2-40) supports this diagnosis. Dr. [] has reviewed the case and concurs with the diagnosis.

ORIGINAL REPORT ON FILE IN SURGICAL PATHOLOGY LABORATORY xxxx [] M.D. Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the Resident/Fellow, [] MD, PhD Electronically Signed Out by [] M.D. Clinical History: The patient is a  -year-old male with malignant spindle cell neoplasm undergoing pleurectomy, decortication, thoracotomy.. Specimens Received: A: Right chest wall mass. B: R4 lymph node C: Number 7 D: Pleural peel Gross Description: The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "right chest wall mass". Received fresh and placed in formalin are 4 soft, rubbery, pink-tan tissue fragments measuring 6.0 x 4.8 x 1.6 cm in aggregate, all of which are serially sectioned and representative section submitted as A1 and A2.. B. The second container is additionally identified as, "R4 lymph node" Received fresh and placed in formalin are 2 soft, yellow-tan tissue fragments measuring 4.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm and 1.0 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm which are submitted entirely as follows: B1-B2: One lymph node candidate, bisected, a one half in each cassette B3: 2 lymph node candidates C. The third container is additionally identified as, "#7". Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple soft, rubbery, pink-tan tissue fragments measuring 2.7 x 4.5 x 0.9 cm in aggregate are submitted entirely as follows:. C1: 2 lymph node candidates, bisected C2: 5 lymph node candidates C3: 2 lymph node candidates C4: 5 lymph node candidates C5: One lymph node candidate, bisected. C6: One lymph node candidate, bisected. D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "right pleural"

Received fresh and placed in formalin is a right pleurectomy specimen with a volumetric measurement of 1250 ml. The specimen is received in 2 large portions, a tumor mass and a pleura with multiple thickened areas, with a combined weight of 1105 gm. The tumor mass measures 18.5 x 18.5 x 11.0 cm and the thickened pleura measures 18.0 x 17.0 x 0.9 cm. According to the requisition form, there is a stitch designating the diaphragm, which is identified. The diaphragm measures 16.0 x 11.0 cm and the abdominal surface of the diaphragm is inked blue. At this site, the tissue is rubbery, firm, tan. There is no adherent pericardium. The parietal pleura is thickened, white-tan, nodular, rubbery, fibrotic and is intact surrounding the lung. 90% of parietal pleura received is encased in firm, yellow-gray tumor nodules measuring up to 5.8 x 2.1 cm located predominantly along the anterolateral aspect of the chest. The visceral and parietal pleura are thickened up to 0.7 cm and fused. The diaphragmatic margin is actively involved with tumor and tumor is within 0.2 cm of the inked resection margin..
