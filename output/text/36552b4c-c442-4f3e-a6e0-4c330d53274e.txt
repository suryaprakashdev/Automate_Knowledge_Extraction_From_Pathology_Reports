Lymph nodes, left tracheoesophageal groove, excision: Multiple (3) lymph nodes are negative for tumor. B. Thyroid, left, total lobectomy: Follicular adenoma (3.3 x 3.2 x 1.8 cm). C. Breast, right, simple mastectomy: Fibroadenoma measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm at the previous. biopsy site in the upper outer quadrant. Remainder shows non-proliferative fibrocystic changes. Multiple (2) right axillary lymph nodes are negative for tumor. D. Breast, left, inferior flap, biopsy: Negative for tumor. E. Breast, left, inferior margin at 6 o'clock, excision: Involved by carcinoma. F. Breast, left, new inferior margin, re-excision: Negative for tumor. G. Breast, left, modified radical mastectomy: Invasive lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III), [tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 6/9], forming multiple (6) masses. (lower inner quadrant, 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm; inferior/central, 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm; central, 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm; lower outer quadrant, 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm and 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm) in the left breast. Ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ are present. The non- neoplastic breast parenchyma shows nonproliferative fibrocystic changes. A second core biopsy site is present in the upper outer quadrant which shows biopsy site changes. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. Dermal nevus forming a 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.3 cm raised, brown, pigmented lesion on the lateral aspect of the skin. All surgical resection margins, after multiple (2) re-excisions of the inferior margin (see parts E and F), are negative for. invasive carcinoma by 1.2 cm, deep margin. Multiple (10 of 19) left axillary lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma. The largest metastasis measures 11.0 mm. Extranodal extension is not present. MIB-1 has been ordered on paraffin-embedded tissue. This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section. histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be retlected in a revised report. 38+3
