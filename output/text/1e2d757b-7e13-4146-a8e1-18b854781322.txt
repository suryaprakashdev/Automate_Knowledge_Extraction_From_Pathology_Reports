TCGA--DU-5852 Surgical Pathology Report aken: Received: Reported: CLINICAL HISTORY The patient with Currently the patient has a lucent, circumscribed lesion in the parahippocampal. gyrus. and hippocampus, which on FLAIR involves nearly the entire temporal 1obe. OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES Epilepsy Operation/Specimen: A: Brain,medial temporal tumor, biopsy. B: Brain, posterior tumor, biopsy. PATHOLOGICAL.DIAGNOSIS: A. Brain, medial temporal tumor, biopsy: Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade III) (see comment). B. Brain, posterior tumor, biopsy: Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (who. Grade III) (see comment). COMMENT Permanent sections are in keeping with agreement of the frozen section diagnoses. Sections of A. and B. show a proliferation of moderately pleomorphic round to oval and occasionally angular cells. Infiltrate cortex shows perineuronal tumor cell satellitosis. Scattered mitotic figures are identified. Vascular proliferation and necrosis are not seen. Immunohistochemical stains performed on part B. show positive GFAP staining of reactive astrocytes and. occasional tumor cells, some of which show a thin rim of perinuclear staining. Corresponding. slides for this case are also reviewed.

Overall'.the tumor is most consistent with an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, with the.oligodendroglial. component being dominant. The Ki-67 labeling index is up to approximately 12%. Positive and negative controls show appropriate immunoreactivity. Molecular studies show that the tumor is negative for 1p,19q Loh and positive for MGmr promoter methylation (see procedure addenda below). PROCEDURES/ADDENDA Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay Date Ordered: Date Reported: Interpretation NEgAtive: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT. . detected. Informative loci are: D1s1592, D1s552, D1s468, D1s1612, D1s496, PLA2G4C, D19S606 and D19S1182 Results-Comments Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. DNA extracted from'a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal reference control. TEST DEscRIpTIoN: Allelic loss is assessed by PcR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on.1p are D1s548, D1s1592, and D1s552 (with D1s468, D1s1612, and D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19s219, D19s412, and PLA2G4C (with D19s606. and D19sl182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt.repeats) except PLA2g4c which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and ease'of interpretation. The backup markers are used if:the first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise

ambiguous.in their interpretation. Loh at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion. FDA coMmENT: :The above data are not to be construed as the results. from 'a stand-alone diaqnostic test. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the as required by regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.s. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These. results are provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted. only in the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.  TECHNICAL SENSITIviTy: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the detection of allelic loss. Eernic ianed Ouf* Date.Ordered: Date Reported:. Interpretation. POsITivE: Methylated MGmT promoter is detected. Results-Comments Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block TEsT DEscRIpTIoN: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have. been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by real-time PcR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated DNA sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was:: assessed to be 1% of methylated DnA in the background of unmethylated. DNA.. Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue'necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT : promoter sequences.
