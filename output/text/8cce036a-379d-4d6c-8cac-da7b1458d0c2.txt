Pancytokeratin: Positive in tumor cells with likely perinephric tissue invasion. CD31: No difinite evidence of intravascular tumor invasion seen. GROSS DESCRIPTION: 1. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "right kidney" is a 302 gram right radical nephrectomy specimen including kidney (9.5 x 7.8 x 6.8 cm) and surrounding perirenal fat measuring in thickness from 1.0 to 2.0 cm. No adrenal gland is identified. Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (2.5 cm in length by 0.3 cm in diameter), renal vein (0.5 cm in length by 0.3 cm in diameter), and renal artery (1 cm in diameter by 0.4 cm in diameter). There is a 5.3 x 5.2 x 4.8 cm pale-white tumor with ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

SPEC #: (Continued) Page: 3 GROSS DEsCRIpTIoN: (continued) perirenal fat without penetrating the renal capsule. The tumor also does not involve renal sinus fat or the renal pelvis. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan/brown with a well-defined cortical medullary junction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistening mucosa. The adipose tissue is thinly sectioned and no lymphnodes are identified. A portion of the tumor is taken for TcgA research.. Devitalization time: Freeze time:. Ink code: black-outer surface of specimen.
