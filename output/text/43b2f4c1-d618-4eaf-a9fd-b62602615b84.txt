RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY (SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY) :  METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA TO FIMBRIATED END OF FALLOPIAN TUBE COMMENT(S) The subtotal colectomy contained two separate but histolcgically indistinguishable. moderately di fferentiated adenocarcinomas. Tumor #1 was located in the cecum and appeared. more advanced with numerous metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Tumor #2 was located in the sigmoid colon without regional lymph node metastasis. In completing the synoptic reports below. I judged the metastatic tumor to be associated with the more advanced cecal adenocarcinoma. ** CCNTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

RUN DATE PAGE 3 RUN TIME : Specimen Inquiry RUN USER: Lab Database: SPEC #:- PATIENT : (Continued) comment(s) (Continued) Regional Lymph Nodes: pNO Number examined: 18 Number involved: 0 Distant Metastasis: not applicable GROSS DESCRIPTION: Specimen A is received in the fresh state labeled "subtotal colectomy with left tube and Ovary". The specimen consists of the following: 15 cm of terminal ileum measuring 2 cm in diameter Vermiform appendix measuring 5 cm in length by 0.7 cm in diameter 65 cm of large intestine measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter. Attached omentum measuring 20 x 14 by up to 2 cm in thickness An ovary and fallopian tube attached in the area of the sigmoid colon Mesentery measuring up to 9 cm in radial dimension at the ileocecal junction and. up to 9 cm in radial dimension at the sigmoid colon Adhesions are noted at the ileocecal junction and between the ovary and sgmoid colon. There are firm tumorous nodules in the mesentery at the ileocecal junction and in the omentum. The omental tumor nodule measures 2 cm in greatest dimension. There are multiple mesenteric nodules at the ileocecal junction measuring up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The bowel is opened to reveal a circumferential fungating tumor in the cecum approximately 2 cm from the ileocacal valve. This tumor measures 4 5 cm along the length of the bowel The bowel is narrowed in this area. A second circumferential fungating mucosal tumor is identified 5 cm above the distal margin.  This second tumor measures 5.5 cm along the length of the bowel and again the bowel appears narrowed in this area. The attached ovary appears enlarged. measuring 5 x 4.5 x 3 cm. It has a smooth tan surface. Its cut surface reveals soft tan tumorous tissue replacing 9o% of the ovary. The fallopian tube with fimbriated end measures 4.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter.. The initial gross features in the O.R. at. The specimen is allowed to are reported to Dr. fix overnight prior to secrioning. Representatsv. sections are submitted as follows: A1 terminal ileum A2 vermiform appendix A3-6 - cecal tumor A7-12- lymph nodes in mesentery regional to cecal tumor A13 apex of ileocecal iesentery A14 omental tumor nodule A15.16- left ovary and tube. A17-20- distal tumor A21 distal margin A22-25- lymph nodes and mesentery regional to distal tumor NOTE :  The tumors invade the full thickness of the bowel wall. likely extending through the. bowel wall Specimen B is received in formalin labeled "right tube and ovary" This is an ovary with ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

The tube with fimbriated end measures 4.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter. The ovary measures 3.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm. It has a normal appearing wrinkled tan surface. The tube is unremarkable. The ovary has a solid tan to white cut surface without obvious tumor. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes Bl and B2. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: SUBTOTAL COLECTOMY.
