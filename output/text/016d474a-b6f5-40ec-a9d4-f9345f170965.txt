There is no other change in diagnosis. 8ite C64.9 After review of the H&E slides, this tumor is designated as type 2 papillary renal cell H1/io113 carcinoma. DIAGNOSIS (A) LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3. TUMOR CONFINED TO KIDNEY. TUMOR MEASURES 4.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION. Margins of resection free of tumor. (B) LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY II: Renal parenchyma with focal glomerulosclerosis, no tumor present. (See comment) (C) ADRENAL BIOPSY: Adrenal cortical tissue. (See comment) COMMENT The specimen designated left partial nephrectomy (specimen B), consists of a fragment of renal parenchyma with focal glomerulosclerosis. Multiple additional deeper sections were examined.. The specimen designated adrenal biopsy (specimen C), consists of a fragment of adrenal cortical tissue. No metastatic carcinoma is identified. Correlation with the clinical findings is suggested. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY - DEEP MARGIN - INK FROZEN SECTION INKED MARGIN - A partial nephrectomy specimen with attached perinephric fat (9.0 x 8.0 x 2.0 cm overall). The portion of kidney is approximately 5.0  5.0 x 2.0 cm and is marked with blue surgical ink along part of the parenchymal resection margin. A 4.5 x 4.0 x 1.9 cm friable orange-brown and focally hemorrhagic tumor mass is present within the kidney parenchyma. The tumor is less than 0.2 cm from the nearest parenchymal margin. No gross extension into perinephric fat is noted. The surrounding renal parenchyma is light tan and unremarkable. INK CODE: Black - parenchymal resection margin; blue - surgically marked parenchymal margin. SECTION CODE: A1, A2, frozen sections of parenchymal margin; A3-A6, tumor with margin; A7-A9, tumor with surrounding adipose and normal kidney; A10, tumor with blue surgical ink; A11-A16, additional tumor section. *FS/DX: REPRESENTATIVE MARGIN FREE OF TUMOR. (B) LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY #2 - A 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm portion of renal parenchyma. The apparent cortical surface displays a 0.3 x 0.3 tan area of vague nodularity. The apparent parenchymal margin is tan and unremarkable. The cut surface does not show grossly invasive tumor.
