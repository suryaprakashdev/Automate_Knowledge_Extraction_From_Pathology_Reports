MRN: Patient: Sex/DOB: Female Surgical Pathology Report.. Collected Date/Time: Accession Number: Received Date/Time: Specimen is received in 2 parts: A.The specimen is labeled "RIGHr SENTINEL NODE" and is received unfixed for frozen section diagnosis. (The specimen is in the formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours). It consists of a large lymph node measuring 3.5 x 2 x 2 cm. Sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes FSA 1-FSA3. Time specimen was removed from the patient: Time specimen was placed in formalin : Ischemic time: 27 minutes B. The specimen is labeled *RIGHr BREAST AND AXILLARY NODES I AND II" and is received in formalin. (The specimen is in the formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours). It consist of mastectomy specimen with lymph nodes weighing 1150.  grams and measuring 30 x 22 x 7 cm with brown skin ellipse measuring 21 x 10 cm, containing grossly unremarkable 2.0 cm in. diameter nipple. The skin is tagged with a black stitch designating the axilla . The posterior margin is composed of smooth fascia which is inked black. The breast is sliced in sagittal planes revealing a 5 x 5 x 4 cm hemorrhagic cavity within the upper inner-central yellow mammary fat with streaks of white-gray mammary parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1 = one lymph node, bisected B2 -- one lymph node, bisected B3 = one lymph node, bisected B4 = 5 lymph nodes B5 = 2 lymph nodes, one bisected.  B6 = one lymph node, bisected B7 = one lymph node, bisected B8 -- one lymph node, bisected B9-B12 = upper inner quadrant-central mass B13 = mass closest to deep fascial margin of resection B14 = nipple B15 = upper inner quadrant B16 = upper outer quadrant B17 = lower outer quadrant B18 - lower inner quadrant B19-28= additional sections from biopsy cavity. Time specimen was removed from the patient: Time specimen was placed in formalin : Ischemic time: 18 minutes Dictated by: Intra Operative Consultation Right sentinel lymph node: one lymph node, positive for carcinoma (1/1). . Special Stains / Slides Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (Block B2, B5, B6) with adequate positive and negative control sections. Immunostains for keratins AE1/AE3 are negative for carcinoma. Page 4 of 5 Print Date/Time:
