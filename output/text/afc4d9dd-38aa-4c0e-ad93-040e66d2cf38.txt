D RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT BREAST SIMPLE MASTECTOMY STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK IS A 1,250 GRAM SIMPLE MASTECTOMY WHICH INCLUDES IRREGULAR ADDITIONAL FRAGMENTS OF YELLOW-RED FATTY TISSUE IN AGGREGATE MEASURING 9 X 7 X 1 CM. THIS TISSUE IS NOT ORIENTED. THE MASTECTOMY ITSELF MEASURES 28.5 X 21 X 5 CM.  THE NIPPLE IS FLATTENED AND SITS WITHIN A 26 X 13 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. THERE IS PALPABLE FIRMNESS IN THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT.  THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT OF THE MASTECTOMY IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP WITH BLACK. SECTIONING REVEALS 2 DISTINCT FIRM MASSES, ONE IN THE 12 O'CLOCK AREA AND THE 2ND CORRESPONDING TO THE PALPABLE FIRMNESS IN THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT. THIS HAS A RIBBON CLIP AND THE 12 O'CLOCK LESION HAS A WING CLIP. THE DEEP MARGIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT LESION IS FIRM AND PINK-TAN FIBROUS TISSUE DOES EXTEND TOWARDS THE MARGIN BUT THE ACTUAL FIRM MASS IS GROSSLY WITHIN THE CONFINES. THE LOWER OUTER MASS MEASURES 2.5 X 2.5 X 2.5 CM. THE 12 O'CLOCK MASS IS SEPARATED BY CM) OF TISSUE AND MEASURES 3.5 X 2.5 X 2.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. ADDITIONAL PINK-TAN FIBROUS TISSUE IS FOUND IN THE MIDPORTION OF THE SPECIMEN WHICH IS THEN SURROUNDED BY YELLOW FATTY TISSUE. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: D1--NIPPLE, D2 AND 3--DEEP MARGIN OVER LOWER OUTER QUADRANT LESION, D4--DEEP MARGIN TO 12 O'CLOCK LESION, D5 AND 6--12 O'CLOCK LESION, D7 THROUGH D9--LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF 12 O'CLOCK LESION, D10--TISSUE BETWEEN THE 2 LESIONS, D11 AND 12--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT LESION LONGITUDINAL SECTION, D13--TUMOR LOWER OUTER QUADRANT. THE TISSUE TO THE 6 O'CLOCK MARGIN OF THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT LESION IS NODULAR AND FOCALLY THERE IS BROWN DISCOLORATION. A SECTION IS SUBMITTED IN D14. THIS IS 1 CM FROM THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT LESION AND 5 CM FROM THE 12 O'CLOCK LESION. OTHER NODULES DEMONSTRATE CYSTS AS A SECTION IN D1S DEMONSTRATES.  D16--UPPER INNER QUADRANT (3 CM FROM 12 O' CLOCK LESION), D17--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT (5 CM FROM 12 O'CLOCK LESION), D18--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT (3 CM FROM LOWER OUTER QUADRANT) LESION).  THE SEPARATELY SUBMITTED PORTIONS OF FATTY TISSUE ARE GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE AND REPRESENTATIVE TISSUE IS SUBMITTED IN D2O AND 21. RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT AXILLARY NODE CONTENTS IS YELLOW-RED FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 12 X 9.5 X 2.5 CM. THE TISSUE IS EXAMINED FOR LYMPH NODES. LYMPH NODES ARE IDENTIFIED AND SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: E1--ONE-HALF OF A FIRM NODE WITH MIRROR IMAGE SUBMITTED PER PROTOCOL,  E2--1 NODE BISECTED, E3--1 NODE BISECTED (MAY ACTUALLY REPRESENT 2 IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT NODES), E4--1 NODE TRISECTED, ES--1 NODE BISECTED, E6--1 NODE BISECTED, E7--1 NODE TRISECTED, E8--3 NODES (1 BISECTED), E9--6 NODES, E1O--1 NODE BISECTED. 1cs-0 -3 Ku 12/i311 UNos Cso.?
