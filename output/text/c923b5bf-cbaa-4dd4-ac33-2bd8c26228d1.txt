CGA-AA-3939 Diagnosis: Right hemicolectomy preparation with a colon and cecal carcinoma characterized histologically as a moderately differentiated, colorectal adenocarcinoma, measuring 3 cm in diameter at the widest point. Invasive spread of the tumor within all intestinal walllayers up to the bordering mesocolic fatty tissue.. Aborally to Bauhin's valve, ascending colon with a tubular adenoma measuring 2.3 cm with moderate epithelial dysplasia (synonym: low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia). An isolated section of the appendix displays enduring, slightly florid, chronic appendicitis and distinctive, enduring periappendicitis with resorptive xanthous tissue reaction, clearly as a result of a tumor-related relocation of the appendix ostium. The subserosa of the cecum and the oral section of the ascending colon have evidently progressive and extensive macrophage-rich inflammation in the context of perityphlitis. The stage of tumor is therefore: pT3, pn0, (0/40) L0 v0; G2 R0 + Page 1
