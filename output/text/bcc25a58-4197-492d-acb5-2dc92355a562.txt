Microscopically. the tumor does focally extend to the inked deep margin which is adjacent to the skeletal muscle tissue on the medial half.  The additional margin tissue submitted for ovaluation is. negative for carcinoma and. assuming that this tissue was obtained from the region of the positive margin on the original specimen, would provide an additional o.8 cm to 1 cm margin.

There is a. 3.5 x 1 cm ellipse of dark brown skin. There is a 2.5 x 2.5 cm portion of skeletal muscle on ths undersurface. On palpation. a mass is appreciated. Two sutures orient the specimen Dr. also placed a smaller as follows: lateral long stitch and superior short stitch. stitch which represents closure of a flap of tissue representing additional tissue at. the superior aspect. The specimen is inked as follows: superio-anterior blue, inferio-. anterior black. lateral yellow. medial red. and deep green. The specimen is placed into Bouin's solution. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a retracted yellowish white tumor which measures 3.5 x 2.2 x 1.7 cm. Core needle biopsy tracts are within the mid. portion of the tumor..  The closest margin is the inked deep margin where the tumor abuts ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **
