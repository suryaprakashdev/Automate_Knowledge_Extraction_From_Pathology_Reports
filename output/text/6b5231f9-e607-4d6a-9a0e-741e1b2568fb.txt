SURGICAL PATHOL Report Patient is a. . female with right infiltrate ductal carcinoma. Specimen(s) Received: A: Sentinel node #1, left side, ct : ouch prep (FS) B: Left Breast 1 stitch superior, 2 stitches lateral, fresh C: Sentinel node #1, right side ct 1 (FS) D: Non-sentinel lymph node right side E: Sentinel lymph node #2, Right side, ct # touch prep (FS) F: Right breast additionai superior flap - perm G: Right breast 1 stitch superior, 2 stitches lateral , fresh Gross Description:. A. Received fresh and labeled *sentinel node #1, left side, ct touch prep (FS)" is a segment of tan-yellow, fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm. Cassettes are submitted as follows: 1 One iymph node bisected submitted in toto for frozen section 2 Remainder adipose tissue submitted in toto in one cassette B. Received fresh and labeled *teft breast 1 stitch superior, 2 stitches lateral* is a mastectomy specimen, which measures 22.0 x 19.0 x 4.0 cm and weighs 790.0 grams. The specimen has an attached ellipse of pale-tan skin with areola and nipple measuring 9.0 x 4.5 cm. The skin and nipple are unremarkable. The specimen is oriented by one stitch superior and two stitches lateral. Surgical margins are inked as follows: superior anterior margin inked in green and the remaining margins are inked in black. Serial section through the specimen revealed one suspicious area of pale-pink induration consistent with previous biopsy site. The indurated area measures approximately 1.1 cm in greatest dimension and is located in the upper inner quadrant at 11 to 12 o'clock, 0.8 cm from the superficial margin, 0.9 cm from the deep margin, 3.0 cm from the superior margin, 16.0 cm from the inferior margin, 3.5 cm from the medlal margin and 12.0 cm from the latera! margin. An area of interparenchyma hemorrhage is also identified in the inner upper quadrant, approximately 5.0 cm from the nipple. An additional suspicious area of pale pink induration with a granular, cut surface is identifled in the lower outer quadrant at approximately 4 o'clock. The second suspicious area is located 2.6 cm away from the deep margin, 1.8 cm away from the superficial margin, 10.5 cm away from the superior margin, 8.5 cm away from the inferior margin, 4.5 cm away from the lateral margin and 13.5 cm away from the medial margin. Cassettes are submitted as follows: 1 Superficial margin 23 Deep margin  Superior margin 4  Inferior margin 5  Medial margin 6 Lateral margin 7-13 Suspicious area and surrounding parenchyma submitted in toto 14 Section of the hemorhagic area. 15 Sections of the second suspicious area 16 Section of the nipple 17 Representative section of uninvolved breast parenchyma in the upper outer quadrant. 18 Representative section of uninvolved parenchyma in the upper inner quadrant. 19 Representative section of uninvolved parenchyma in the lower inner quadrant. 20  Representative section of uninvolved parenchyma in the lower outer quadrant. c. Received fresh and labeled "sentinel node #1, right side. ' is a segment of tan-yellow, fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. Examinations of the specimen revealed two possible lymph nodes. Cassettes are submitted as follows: 1 One lymph node bisected and submitted for frozen section 2 One lymph node bisected submitted for frozen section. 3 Remainder of the adipose tissue submitted for frozen section in one cassette. D. Received in formalin and labeled *non-sentinel lymph node right side~is a segment of tan-white, soft tissue measuring 1.8 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette. Page 3 of 4

SURGICAL PATHOL Roport such prep (Fs)" is a segment of tan-yellow, E Received fresh and labeled "sentinel lymph node #2, right side, ct fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.1 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm. Examinations of the segment revealed one lymph node. Cassettes are submitted as follows: 1 One lymph node bisected and submitted for frozen section 2 F. Received in formalin and labeled *right breast additional superior flap" is a segment of tan-yellow, fibroadipose tissue measuring 6.0 x 3.7 x 1.6 cm. The specimen is received unoriented. One of the surface is rough, irregular and appears to face the previous resection site. The surface was inked in orange. The opposite surface was inked in black. Serial sections through the specimen revealed no suspicious areas. Representative sections submitted in six cassettes. G. Received fresh and labeled *right breast 1 stitch superior, 2 stitches lateral" is a mastectomy specimen, which measures 23.0 x 22.0 x 4.0 cm and weighs 670.0 grams. There is an ellipse of skin with areola and nipple, which measures 9.0 x 3.5 x 0.2 cm. The nipple measures 1.2 x 1.1 cm. The skin is unremarkable. The section margins are inked as foliows: superior, green and all other margins are inked in black. Serial section through the specimen revealed an area of pale. pink induration measuring 2.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm and is located in the lower outer quadrant. A firm area is present at the  superficial margin and is located 3.0 cm from the inferior margin, 2.5 cm from the deep margin and 7.0 cm from the superior margin. The remainder of the parenchyma consists of unremarkable fibroadipose tissue with approximately 70% adipose tissue and 30% stroma. No other suspicious areas were identified. Cassettes are submitted as follows: 1 Anterior margin 23 Inferior margin Deep margin 4 Lateral margin 5  Superior margin 6 Medial margin 7-13 Area of induration submitted 14  Representative section of uninvolved parenchyma in the upper outer quadrant. 15  Representative section of uninvolved parenchyma in the upper inner quadrant. 16  Representative section of uninvoived parenchyma in the lower inner quadrant. 17 'ative section of uninvoived parenchyma in the lower outer quadrant near the lesion.
