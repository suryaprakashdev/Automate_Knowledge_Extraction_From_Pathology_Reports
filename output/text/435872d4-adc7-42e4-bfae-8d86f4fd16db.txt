SPECIMEN SOURCE Right breast SUMMARY Tissue section ot the invasive carcinoma :.  vas evaluated for HER-2/neu gene. amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the. HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSl HER-2/neu SpectrumOrange/CEP17 Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.62 copies of LS HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.45 copies of CEP17 per nucleus. Negative and positive controls (established by ) with this batch are. appropriate. Two representative images have been archived. INTERPRETATION The tumor cells demonstrated no ampliflcation of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.11 ) The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing:. Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 -- 2.20; amplified HER-2/neu levels: > 2.20 (Ret: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43) NOTES The LSl HER-2/neu probe is specitic tor the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP 17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satelite DNA sequence at the centromeric region ot Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1 -q11.2). This test has been cleared and approved for specitic uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Its system is operating within the performance specitications stated in the product insert.
