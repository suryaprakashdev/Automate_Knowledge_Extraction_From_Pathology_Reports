Electronic Signature: CLINICAL INFORMATION CLINICAL HISTORY: Preoperative Diagnosis: Right modified radical mastectomy with sentinel node mapping with frozen section. Adenocarcinoma, with papillary subtype. (Papillary carcinoma) ER positive, PR positive. Postoperative Diagnosis: Symptoms/Radiotogic Findings: SPECIMENS: A. Sentinei node right, count 4600 with frozen section 8. Right breast tissue 1453 grams SPECIMENDATA Gross DescripTIon: The specimen is received in two containers labeled with the patient's name ' A. Container A is received fresh for frozen section, additionally labeled 'right sentinel node' and contains a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate ot yeilow tan fibrofatty soft tissue. On palpation, a 1.3 cm firm fatty nodule is identified consistent with possible lymph node. The nodule is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section. The residual is entirely resubmitted for permanent section in cassette A iabeled B. Container B is received with formalin additionally labeled 'right breast tissue' and consists of a 1439.4 gram, 27.5 x 19.0 x 6.5 cm simple mastectomy  specimen partially surfaced by pink-tan wrinkled skin which bears a central 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm slightty raised nippie. Orientation is not offered or possible.  Located 0.7 cm from the skin edge and 7.8 cm from the nipple is a 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm gray-brown raised skin lesion. Additional skin lesions are not  identined. The deep margin is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm cystic lesion containing pink-tan friable soft tissue, along with a radiographic dip. This lesion resides 4.5 cm from the skin surface and 2.2 cm from the inked deep margin. Multiple additional pink- tan rubbory lesions are idantifed diffusely scattered throughout the specimen and involve allfour quadrants. The largest of these remaining lesions is 3.0 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm and approaches to within 0.4 cm of the inked deep margin. The uninvoived areas are comprised of yellow-tan adipose tissue admixed wth moderate amounts of intersparsed gray-white fibrous tissue. Discrete axillary tail is not present, however, five firn fatty possible iymph nodes are  identified aiong one edge of the specinen. These possible lymph nodes range from 1.0 up to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Also received in the same container are two portions ot pink-tan wrinkled skin with yellow-tan subcutaneous fibroadipose tissue. These tissues are 8.0 x 2.0  1.3 cm and 16.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The cut surfaces are yellow tan fibrofatty with no discrete lesions. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes B1 through 13 labeled  esignated as follows: 1, nipple; 2, skin lesion, entirely; 3 and 4, radiographically located lesion; 5 and 6, Iargest additional lesion to inked uuup margin, perpendicular; 7 through 10, additional representative lesions from all four quadrants; 11, two whole possible lymph nodes; 12, two whole possible bisected lymph nodes (one inked): 13. one whole possible bisected iymph node. Additionally, a yeilow, areen and blue cassette are submitted for genomics research each labeled InirA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATiON: FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Part A: No neoplasm identified (0/1) p.r D;
