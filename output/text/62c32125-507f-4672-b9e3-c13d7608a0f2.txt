COMMENT: Part 1: The gross examination demonstrated an ill-dofinod firm nodule with surrounding fibrous tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm. This area was entirely submitted for histologic evaluatlon and shows Invasive carcinoma in only two sections of 0.4 cm thickness and therefore, the invasive tumor size is estimated to be 0.8 cm in largest dimension. The  majority of this gross lesion is composed of ductal carcinoma in situ (DciS). Part 3: The invasive tumor demonstrates scattered cells with intra-cytoplasmic lumina or signet ring cell morphology-
