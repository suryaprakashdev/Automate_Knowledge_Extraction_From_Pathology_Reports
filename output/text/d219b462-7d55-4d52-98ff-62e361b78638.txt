"Left renal tumor long stitch lateral short stitch inferior' consisting of a partial nephrectomy specimen measuring 8.0 x 6.3 x 6.5 cm. There is an area on the posterior-inferior surface where the margin is disrupted during surgery. The surgeon asks that the tumor from the inferior short stitch be sampled separately as it is a different color from the rest of the tumor. The anterior  surface of the specimen is inked in black and a single incision is made revealing a tar-red friable cut surface. Approximately 50% of tissue from this surface is procured for. Two needle cores are additionally procured for  The remainder of the specimen is placed into formalin and submitted to Pathology for permanent processing. The procurement was documented and performed by . Received in Surgical Pathology on at is a specimen matching the above description. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked in blue. The deep inferior margin is entirely submitted in cassette. The nodule abutting the inferior margin is a golden yellow color. A. representative section of this nodule is submitted in cassette 1B-1C. The dominant nodule appears predominantly necrotic. Scar-like fibrous septae are identified coursing. through this nodule. The dominant nodule measures 6.0 cm in greatest dimension. A representative section of the dominant nodule with respect to the posterior margin is submitted in cassette Additional representative sections of the  main nodule are submitted in cassettes. An additional section of the inferior margin nodule with respect to that margin is submitted in cassette Additional representative sections of the dominant nodule are submitted in cassette . J. The remaining tissue is retumed to  formalin. 2. "Normal parenchyma medial inferior margin". The specimen  consists of a tan-brown soft tissue fragment consistent with renal parenchyma measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and representative sections are submitted in cassettes .-D.' The remaining tissue is returned to formalin.. 3. "Normal parenchyma lateral inferior margin" consisting of a  portion of tan-brown soft tissue consistent with renal parenchyma measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. It is entirely submitted in cassette 1.
