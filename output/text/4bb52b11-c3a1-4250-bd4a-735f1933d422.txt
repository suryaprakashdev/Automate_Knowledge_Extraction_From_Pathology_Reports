Additional findings: High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Comment: On the original radical prostatectomy specimen. (part B), the right lateral margin is positive, however, the additional tissue submitted as right. Iateral margin (part F) shows no tumor, therefore the final margin of the right lateral margin is negative.

FINAL SuRGICAL PATHOLOGy REPORT Source of Specimen: A. Left Kidney Mass B. Prostatectomy C. Right lliac Obturator D. Left Iliac Obturator E. Left Lateral Margin F. Right Lateral Margin Clinical History/Operative Dx:. Left kidney mass, prostate cancer Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled left kidney mass and is received without fixative. It consists of a cortical portion of kidney which overall measures 3.3 x 3.1 x 2.9 cm and.  The cortical surface of the kidney appears smooth with intact renal capsule. The surgical margin is inked. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a well circumscribed mass measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm. This mass is variably composed of pale tan to granular reddish and hemorrhagic tissue. It abuts the cortical surface but there is no overlying perirenal fat. It is grossly 0.5 cm from the closest cortical resection margin. Representative sections of this neoplasm are obtained for research purposes. Also in the specimen container is a 4 cm aggregate of lobulated fatty tissue which is serially sectioned and contains no obvious tumor. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1-A4) renal neoplasm and cortical resection margin, A5) peripheral section of neoplasm and representative separate fatty tissue. B. The specimen is labeled prostate and is received in formalin. It consists of a prostatectomy specimen which  The prostate gland measures 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.4 cm and includes a partially. disrupted 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm right seminal vesicle, a 1.7 cm segment of right vas deferens, a 1.7 cm segment of left vas deferens, and a short but intact appearing 1.8 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm left seminal vesicle. The right anterior surface of the prostate is inked blue, the left anterior surface is inked green, and the posterior surface is inked black. The prostatic apex, bladder neck, and seminal vesicle / vasa are trimmed. The prostate is divided into right and left halves and is sectioned from apex to bladder neck. The right apical portion of the prostate anteriorly displays pale yellow-tan discoloration in two discrete foci, each 0.7 cm in maximum dimensions. One of these areas is just adjacent to the apical portion of the prostate and the other is located in the mid gland. The prostatic gland parenchyma throughout the left prostate is spongy tan and fibrous. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: B1) right prostatic apex, B2) left prostatic apex, B3) right bladder neck, B4) left bladder neck, B5) surgical margin right vas deferens, right seminal vesicle, B6) surgical margin left vas deferens, left seminal vesicle, B7-B24) prostate, apex- bladder neck C. The specimen is labeled right iliac obturator and is received in formalin. It consists of a 5.5 x 3 x 1.8 cm ovoid portion of fibrofatty tissue and a small 1.1 cm fragment of similar tissue. On dissection there is an ovoid partially fatty replaced 4.5 cm node. In the remaining tissue there is a 2.3 cm node, 1.2 cm

FInAl SurgiCAl pAThOLOGy rEpOrt fragment of nodal tissue, and three additional fragmented portions of nodal tissue varying from 0.8 - 1 cm in maximum dimension. On sectioning the largest node has a firm pale tan glistening appearance throughout. The smaller node and nodal fragments have a similar appearance. Representative sections of the largest node are submitted in cassettes C1-C2. The second largest node is bivalved and submitted in cassette C3. A single node is serially sectioned and submitted in cassette C4. Representative sections of the remaining nodal fragments are submitted in cassette C5. D. The specimen is labeled left iliac obturator and is received in formalin. It consists of a 7.2 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm ovoid portion of fibrofatty tissue. On dissection there is a large matted portion of nodal tissue measuring 6.5 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm. In the small amount of adherent fatty tissue are three 0.5 - 0.7 cm additional nodes. The largest matted set of nodes is serially sectioned and is composed of pale tan glistening uniform appearing tissue with a peripheral small amount of fatty tissue. Representative sections of the largest matted node are submitted in cassettes D1-D4. The smaller nodes are submitted in cassette D5 E. The specimen is labeled left lateral margin and is received in formalin. It consists of a 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm fragment of tan to reddish brown tissue with a metallic clip along one edge. The specimen is submitted in cassette E1. F. The specimen is labeled right lateral margin and is received in formalin. It consists of two metallic clips with a small amount of intervening red-brown soft tissue. The clips are removed and the intervening tissue is submitted in cassette F1. Microscopic Description: A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. B. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. C. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. Immunohistochemistry was performed and interpreted at for BCL-2, BCL- 6, CD10, CD3, CD20, CD23, CD5, CD21, cyclin D1, IHD, and Ki-67. Immunohistochemistry was performed at ProPath and interpreted at for ZAP 70. Sections show lymph node with effaced architecture with a pseudofollicular pattern of regularly distributed pale areas (proliferation centers) and a dark background of smaller cells. The tumor cells are positive for CD20, CD5, CD23, IgD, and Bcl-2 and negative for CD10, Bcl-6, cyclin D1 and CD3. CD3 stains background T cells. CD21 highlights rare follicular dendritic networks. Ki-67 shows increased staining in the proliferation center areas. The tumor cells are positive for ZAP70. No metastatic carcinoma is identified. No large cell transformation is identified. D. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. Sections show an atypical small lymphoid proliferation histologically similar to that seen in part C.
