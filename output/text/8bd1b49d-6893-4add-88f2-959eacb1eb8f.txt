TCGA-A6-2676 SPECIMEN Terminal ileum, right colon with attached small bowel and right ovary CLINICAL NOTES PRE-OP DIAGNosIs: Ascending colon mass. GROSS DESCRIPTION Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled "terminal. ileum, right colon with attached small bowel and right ovary" is a previously unopened 35 cm. segment of proximal right colon with attached 50 cm. of distal ileum, an additional 10 cm. of adhesed small bowel and cerebriform 2.7 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm.. rubbery tan gold ovary with associated 2.2 cm. fimbriated tubal segment. A minimal amount of unremarkable omentum is present in addition to a moderate amount of mesocolon and mesentery. The serosa is smooth to scabrous tan pink-purple. The proximal and distal margins measure 3.7 and 6.2 cm. in circumference respectively. On opening there is a necrotic 12.5 x 9.5 cm. circumferential white pink-red tumor mass at the ileocecal valve involving both the distal ileum and proximal. cecum. A portion of tumor is procured as requested. On sectioning, there is a maximal thickness of 3.5 cm. grossly descending through the muscularis into the attached mesocolon and extending to within less than 0.1 cm. of the inked free radial serosal surface (surface of the attached mesocolon inked orange and surface of free serosal surface inked black). In addition, the tumor extends through the wall of the colon and that of the attached additional segment of small bowel to within 0.15 cm. of the mucosal surface of the additional segment. The uninvolved ileal and colonic mucosa is unremarkable glistening tan pink with regular folds and the walls average 0.5 cm. in thickness. No additional mass lesion or abnormality is identified. No appendix is present. The. aforementioned ovary and tubal segment is not involved by tumor, associated with the specimen solely by adhesions. The ?? is GROSS DESCRIPTION pale tan with identifiable corpora albicantia. Several soft to slightly rubbery pale tan tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the. attached mesocolon and mesentery. Representative sections are submitted in 15 blocks as labeled. BLOCK suMMARy: 1 - Margin; 2 and 3 - tumor full thickness through. mesocolon to surface of mesocolon (inked orange; point of continuity. inked red); 4 and 5 - tumor full thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 6 - tumor full thickness to attached additional small bowel segment; 7 - IcB; 8 - tumor to normal ileum and normal colon; 9 - random ileum; 10 - random colon; 11 - adhesed ovary and tube segment; 12 and 13 - eight whole lymph nodes per cassette; 14. and 15 - one bisected lymph per cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. Primary tumor (pT): Tumor has extended through the wall of the colon into the wall of the adjacent small intestine (pT4). Proximal margin: Negative. Distal margin: Negative. Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative. Vascular invasion: Negative. Regional lymph nodes (pN): Fifteen mesenteric lymph nodes are free of metastatic carcinoma (pNo). Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Absent. Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed (pmx). Other findings: Right ovary and fallopian tube adhesed to the colon without evidence of involvement by tumor. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 5, 3 DIAGNOSIS Terminal ileum right colon with attached small bowel and right ovary and fallopian tube, en bloc resection: Invasive poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation extending through the wall of the colon. into the wall of the adhesed small bowel segment. Tumor also extends across the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum. Proximal, distal and radial margins of resection are free. of tumor.. Fifteen mesenteric lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic. carcinoma (0/15). Adhesed right fallopian tube and ovary without evidence of. involvement by tumor.
