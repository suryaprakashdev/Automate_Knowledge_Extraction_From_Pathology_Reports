Both have positive axillary lymph nodes with the positivs left axillary node present in the tail of the breast region of the simple mastectomy specimen. Of note is that the sentinel lymph node on the left side was found to be negative for carcinoma. High-grade Dcis with comedo necrosis is associated with both tumors. most prominent on the left side where in some areas it is difficult to distinguish the in situ from the invasive component. The left breast carcinoma is associated with numerous amorphous chunk-like microcalcifications. left and The previous core needle biopsy material from these tumors ( right) were evaluated with a breast prognostic panel. The carcinomas were both. found to be weakly positive for estrogen receptor and with discordant findings with regards to HER2/neu by immunohistochemical stain and FIsh analysis. Due to the extensive necrosis present on the previous core naedle biopsy. both tumors are being further evaluated for HER2/nau status. As this case was received in the department such that it does not fall within the 6-48 hour time frame for formalin fixation and due to some difficulty in sorting out the invasive component from the Dcis component in sections of the left breast mass. the positive lymph node from the left breast with 5 hours of formalin fixation and two sections of the tumor from the right breast (block c1 with 5 hours of formalin fixation and block c5 with 77 hours of formalin fixation) are being further evaluated for HER2/nsu status by immunohistochemical stains and possible FIsh. The results of these studies will be reported separately as an addendum..

Average Number of chromosomes 17/cell: 1.8 Note:  Performed on core needle biopsy GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. a 413 gram. 27.0 x 12.5 x 3.0 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast has an overlying 24.0 x 12.5 cm portion of brown/black skin. The skin has a central to slightly eccentric 5.5 x 4.5 cm areola and a somewhat contral 1.5 cm nipple. The skin surface has multiple papules with no scars or lesions identified. The deep margin is predominantly smooth and is inked blue. The. breast is serially sectioned from medial to lateral to have a central/lateral 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.4 cm indurated to centrally necrotic hemorrhagic to yellow appearing tumor mass. The tumor mass is at least 18 cm from medial. is approximately 5 cm from lateral. is approximately 5 cm from superior and 5 cm from inferior. The tumor is 0.2 cm from the deep  for margin and the deep margin slides aasily over ths mass. Sections of tumor are sampled. Tissue Banking. A large. 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. nodular.lymph node is identified in the lateral most aspect of the breast tissue. Two additional smaller lymph nodes are present. section of the large lymph node is sampled for frozen section diagnosis. The two smaller nodes are 0.4 and 0.8 cm. The remainder of the breast tissue is diffusely fibrous with. fibrocystic change. There is indurated fibrocystic change adjacent to the tumor and ranges up to an additional 2.0 cm. The white fibrous tissue makes up between 75 and 80% of the parenchyma.  There is diffuse ecchymotic hemorrhage lateral to the tumor predominant in the lower/outer quadrant. The breast tissue is diffusely nodular. however. no additional discrete tumor like mass is identified. Representative sections are sampled to be submitted. following overnight fixation for a repeat of tumor markers. The remainder of the specimen Representative sections are sampled as labeled in ths following. will be held for fixation. cassettes: A1 frozen section residue A2 ramainder of the lymph node A3 sliver of tumor ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

The remainder of the sections will be submitted following further fixation as labeled: A4-A5 sections of nipple. A6 en face areola sectioned. A7-A8 full cross sections of tumor to deep margin A9 smaller lymph node submitted in toto A10 area of indurated nodularity adjacent to tumor A11 upper/outer quadrant sampled A12 lower/outer quadrant sampled (quadrant most closely associated with tumor) A13 upper/inner quadrant sampled A14 lower/inner quadrant sampled B.  Part B is received in formalin. labeled with the patient's name and "left sentinel node". Received is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm aggregate of yellow adipose. The adipose is sectioned to have three nodular lymph nodes which range from 0.5 cm to a linear 1.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The larger node has been designated in the OR as the sentinel node. Each node is sectioned perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted per santinel lymph node protocol with the sentinel node submitted in B1-B2 and the additional nodes submitted separately B3-B4. C. Received fresh for Tissue Banking, labeled with the patient's name and "right breast with axillary node contents" is a 445 gram. 23.0 x 13.0 x 3.0 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast has an overlying 22.5 x 11.0 cm black/brown skin ellipse. The ellipse has multiple raised papules across the surface and an eccentrically. medially located 6.0 x 5.0 cm areola with a 1.3 cm mildly flattened nipple. No scars or lesions are identified on the skin surface. The breast is received with a 9.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm axillary tail and the specimen is consistent with a modified radical mastectomy specimen. The deep fascial plane is smooth and somewhat irregular. The deep fascial plane will be inked blue and the breast is serially sectioned from medial to lateral to have a medially located 4.0 x 3.7 x 3.0 cm tumor mass. The mass is 0.5 cm from the nearest inked deep margin. There is a portion that comes within 0.6 cm of superior, 0.8 cm of medial and is 0.4 cm from inferior at the medial most tip of the breast specimen. A second spherical 2.0 cm mass is located in the upper/outer quadrant. This mass is 0.4 cm from the deep margin and the deep margin slides easily over the mass. The second mass is approximately 2.5 cm from superior. is 12.5 cm inferior. is 15 cm from medial and 8 cm from lateral. Further sectioning of the large mass shows it to focally extend to the superior peripheral margin. The remainder of the breast parenchyma has diffuse dense white fibrous tissue with diffuse fibrocystic change. The fibrous tissue makes up between 80 and 90% of the parenchyma. No additional discrete tumor like masses are identified. The axillary tail is sectioned to have multiple nodular lymph nodes. The nodes include tumor replaced nodes and range up to a positive. 4.0 x 2.5 x 2.5 the necrosis in the large tumor mass.
