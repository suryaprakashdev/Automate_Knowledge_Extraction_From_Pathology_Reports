837D] 3 Oc ID: Site: Cortex of adrenolghud. 074.0 TSS ID: AO4/29/13 Tumor ID: UUID:9C523464-BFDB-4C7A-972E-2EBECDBBFF3E SPECIMEN(S): Redacted TCGA-PA-A5YG-01A-PR A: Lipoma B: Left adrenal gland and mass. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: B. Adrenal gland, left, excision:. - Adrenal cortical carcinoma, low grade - 7.8 cm greatest dimension. - 171 gm - Margins of resection free of malignancy - See case summary. A. Soft tissue, back, excision:. - Lipoma. COMMENT: This case has been reviewed, who concurs with the interpretation of low-grade adrenal cortical carcinoma. The findings of a sheet-like infiltration pattern, necrosis, capsular vascular invasion, and nuclear atypia are fairly typical of carcinomas. In addition, the size in excess of 7 cm and the weight of 171 gm are also both more lw 7/13 ALIFIED

typical of carcinoma. The eosinophilic cytoplasm is also more typical of carcinoma. Absolute distinction between adrenal cortical adenomas and carcinomas is not always possible; however, multiple series have shown having many of the features described are associated with malignant behavior. American Journal Clinical Pathology, 1996; 105:76-86. Specimen: Adrenal gland; received: Fresh Procedure: Adrenalectomy, total. Specimen Integrity: Intact.

I have personally reviewed all specimens and or slides, including the. listed special stains, and used them with my medical judgement to  determine the final diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a -year-old male with growth on adrenal gland. Operative Procedure: Lipoma excision and left adrenal gland and mass excision. GROSS: Two formalin-filled containers are received, each labeled with the patient's name, and medical record number.. A. The first container is labeled "A -lipoma." The specimen. consists of four tan-red-white, and cauterized rubbery tissue measuring ranging from 0.7 to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension and 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. Sectioning reveals yellow-red solid cut surface. Entirely submitted in A1 and A2.. B. The second container is received fresh and subsequently. saved in formalin and labeled "B - left adrenal gland and mass." The specimen consists of a 17 x 8 x 4.9 cm and 171 gm portion of yellow lobulated fibroadipose tissue. The entire external surface is inked black. Sectioning reveals a 7.8 x 5.7 x 4.6 cm yellow-brown solid,

ovoid mass. Focal white firm calcifications measuring up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension is noted in the central area. Also, a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm pink and lightly fleshy area is present on the peripheral area of the mass. A purple-red hemorrhage is noted measuring up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. Grossly, the mass is entirely encapsulated. On the edge of the mass is a 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm bright yellow-brown adrenal gland tissue. Representative tissue was procured for potential future studies. The specimen is photographed. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of Sections:. B1 -B3 mass with adrenal gland. B4-B5 - mass to include the pink solid area.. B6 - mass to include hemorrhage.. B7 - mass. 88 - mass to include calcification following fixation and. decalcification. MICROSCOPIC: Microscopic examination is performed.. Sections show a low-grade adrenal cortical carcinoma. The adrenal is  expanded by a 7 cm nodule of eosinophilic cells, many with nucleomegaly and poly-lobation. Tumor is arranged largely in sheets, without trabecular or small cell patterning. The neoplasm is thickly

encapsulated, with foci of necrosis. Focally, there is vascular penetration of the capsule; however, the marked margins of resection are free of malignancy. Mitotic activity is inconspicuous. Immunohistochemical stains performed on the tumor show focal immunoreactivity to vimentin. Melan-A is focally positive, with good internal control. There is no immunoreactivity with antibodies to. Pan-Cytokeratin (AE1/AE3). There is weak focal immunoreactivity with antibodies to synaptophysin, but not with antibodies to chromogranin... S-100 highlights normal adipocytes. An antibody to inhibin highlights normal adrenal cortical cells, but does not react with the tumor.
