Comment: Two foci of infiltrating ductal carcinoma are present, both in the lower inner quadrant. Grossly, these masses were separated by 1.9 cm of soft fibroadipose tissue. Histologically, the intervening tissue shows ductal carcinoma in situ and carcinoma present within lymphatic spaces. The smaller tumor is less than 1 mm from the posterior specimen margin in the mastectomy specimen; however, it is possible that this margin is superseded by the separately submitted ' posterior margin' (part A). The morphology of the invasive carcinoma from the two masses is similar, as is the morphology of the in situ carcinoma admixed with each mass. These two masses may represent two separate foci of invasion arising from ductal carcinoma in situ or may be arising from a focus of lymphovascular invasion (i.e., an  intramammary metastasis). The tumor stage is based on the larger of the two

masses. Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2/neu were performed on the biopsy specimen from the larger of the two  masses. Immunohistochemical analysis of the smaller tumor mass will be performed and the results will be reported in an addendum. Gross Description: Specimen A is received in a formalin-filled container labeled "left re-excision posterior margin, tumor clip posterior" and is a partially oriented 2.6 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm fragment of mainly brown/red muscle with some minimal adherent fibroadipose tissue. There is a clip on one surface indicating the margin. This surface is inked blue. The remainder of the specimen is inked black. Sectioning exhibits unremarkable red/brown muscle with minimal fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in blocks A1 and A2. Specimen B is received in a formalin-filled container labeled "right total mastectomy, stitch marks axillary tail". Specimen fixation: Formalin Time in fixative: 7 hours Type of mastectomy: Total, per the specimen container and requisition Size of specimen: 300 grams, 19 x 15.5 x 3.0 cm Orientation of specimen: There is a stitch marking axillary tail. At the time of tissue procurement triage, the specimen is inked as follows: anterior/green, posterior/purple, axillary tail (lateral)/yellow.. Skin ellipse dimensions: 18.5 x 4.2 cm. The lightly pigmented skin ellipse is remarkable for multiple brown papules from 2 to 13 mm in greatest dimension. Just superior lateral to the nipple, there is a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm raised flesh colored papule identified. The remainder of the papules are somewhat flatter and some are macules. Nipple/areola: 1.5 cm / 2.7 cm. Axillary tail: Axillary tail is not well-delineated. The lateral  breast tissue is sectioned and no lymph node candidates are identified. Biopsy site: N/A

Nipple/areola: 1.5 cm/ 3.5 cm. These structures are. unremarkable. Axillary tail: Axillary tail is 8 x 6.5 x 1.8 cm. The.  axillary tail is amputated and palpated for lymph node candidates. Multiple. lymph node candidates are identified from 4 x 4 x 3 mm to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. Biopsy site: N/A Residual tumor: Present. There are two lesions identified. The first lesion is 2.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. This lesion is well-circumscribed and has a tan/red, focally hemorrhagic cut surface. This lesion is found within a background of dense white breast tissue. There is a second 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. mass identified. This mass is also well-circumscribed and has a firm red/white. cut surface. These masses are 1.9 cm from one another. Mass #1 is slightly inferior to the. nipple in the subareolar region. Mass #2 is inferior and posterior to mass #1. Location of tumor: See above. Both masses are found in the inner lower quadrant. Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: Mass #1 2.4 cm to the deep purple inked margin, 5 mm to the skin, 4.1 cm to the inferior margin, approximately 6 cm to the medial margin, approximately 8 cm to the superior margin and distal to the lateral margin. Mass #2 is very close to the purple inked posterior margin, is approximately 3 cm to the inferior margin, at least 10 cm to the superior margin, approximately 5.6 cm to the medial margin and distant to the lateral margin. Mass #2 is 3.4 cm to the green inked anterior margin. Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: N/A Description of remainder of breast:. The remainder of the mastectomy specimen consists of yellow lobulated fibroadipose tissue separated by thin fibrous septae. There is dense firm white breast tissue scattered throughout the entire specimen. Other remarkable features: None Tissue submitted for special investigations:.

Computer-assisted quantitative score: 27% HER2/neu ( clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: INDETERMINATE Computer-assisted quantitative score: 2+ (see comment) Site: Left breast Performed on block: C3 Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixation time: 6-48 hours. Reference range: Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor: <1%=NEGATIVE, 1-10% WEAK POSITIVE, >10% POSITIVE HER2/neu: 0,1=NEGATIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION, 2-INDETERMINATE, 3=POSITIVE FOR OVEREXPRESSION Comment: The auantitative scores reported above were obtained using the FDA-approved  The control slides for this case show. appropriate staining. The patient' s larger tumor was sampled and tested previously, which showed a similar pattern of immunohistochemical staining for HER-2/neu. Subsequent in situ hybridization studies for HER-2/neu gene amplification on that specimen showed that the. tumor was positive for Her-2/neu gene amplification. In situ hybridization studies can be repeated on the current specimen, if clinically desired.. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classified as. analyte specific reagents (ASR) or research use only (RUO) reagents. These were developed and have performance characteristics determined by the. These reagents have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational. or for research.
