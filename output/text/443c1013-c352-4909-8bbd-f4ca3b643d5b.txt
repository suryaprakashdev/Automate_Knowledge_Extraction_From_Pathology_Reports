Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS (A) PORTION OF 11TH RIB: Segment of rib for gross inspection only. (B) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY MID ASPECT: CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, EOSINOPHILIC TYPE, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (SEE COMMENT) TUMOR FOCALLY EXTENDS INTO PERINEPHRIC ADIPOSE TISSUE TUMOR MEASURES 4.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION. Parenchymal and soft tissue margins of resection free of tumor.. (C) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY MID ASPECT, INFERIOR MARGIN:  Renal parenchyma, no tumor present. (D) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY, MID ASPECT, INFERIOR/LATERAL: Renal parenchyma, no tumor present. (E) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY MID ASPECT, LATERAL MARGIN: Renal parenchyma, no tumor present. (F) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY, MID ASPECT, SUPERIOR MARGIN: Renal parenchyma, no tumor present. (G) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY, MID ASPECT, SUPERIOR/LATERAL: Renal parenchyma, no tumor present. (H) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY, MID ASPECT, DEEP/MEDIAL:  Renal parenchyma, no tumor present. (I) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY, DEEP/LATERAL:  Renal parenchyma, no tumor present. (J) LEFT ADRENAL GLAND: Adrenal gland, no tumor present. (K) LEFT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES: Seven lymph nodes, no tumor present. COMMENT The tumor is composed predominantly of cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm and perinuclear halos. The immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the tumor is strongly and diffusely positive for ctyokeratin 7 and negative for vimentin. CD10 stain demonstrates predominantly cytoplasmic and focally membranous staining. The electron microscopic examination demonstrates the presence of large number of intracytoplasmic vesicles with few occasional mitochondria with tubular cristae. The immunohistochemical profile and the electron microscopic findings are consistent with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) PORTION OF 11TH RIB - The specimen consists of an 8.1 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm tan portion of rib with overlying shaggy dark red cauterized skeletal muscle. The specimen is for gross inspection only.. (B) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY, MID ASPECT - A 9.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm partial nephrectomy specimen. There is a tumor (4.5 x 4.2 x 4.0 cm) with yellow-brown/mahogany, lobulated surface with focal areas of hemorrhage and a central scar. The nearest perpendicular margin is 0.5 cm from the tumor. No extension into perinephric adipose tissue is identified grossly. Remaining kidney appears to be unremarkable.. INK CODE: Black - parenchymal margin. SECTION CODE: B1, representative section of tumor with nearest perpendicular parenchymal margin; B2-B13, multiple representative sections of tumor with nearest margin and adjacent normal kidney. SL/amf *FS/DX: ONCOCYTIC NEOPLASM, DEFER FOR PERMANENT; MARGIN FREE OF TUMOR, TUMOR GROSSLY 0.5 CM FROM NEAREST PARENCHYMAL MARGIN. 1

FVL:DO/mgd (I) LEFT PARTIAL KIDNEY, DEEP/LATERAL - Two fragments, 0.6 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm and 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm; submitted entirely for frozen section evaluation in I.. *FS/DX: RENAL PARENCHYMA, NO TUMOR PRESENT. FVL:DO/mgd (J) LEFT ADRENAL GLAND - A 7.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm piece of lobulated yellow-tan adipose tissue containing a 4.0 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm adrenal gland and a segment of vein (1.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter). The adrenal cortex and medulla appear unremarkable. SECTION CODE: J1, J2, representative sections of adrenal gland including cross section of vein.. (K) LEFT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES - A piece of lobulated yellow-tan adipose tissue (9.0 x 3.0 x 0.5 cm). Six possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.5 to 0.7 cm.
