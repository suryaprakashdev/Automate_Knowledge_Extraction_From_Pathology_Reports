Page 6 of 6  Sections of the bladder show a deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial. J: carcinoma (J1-11). The tumor extends almost but not completely through the muscularis propria of the bladder wall (J3) where it approachea without involving the perivesical soft tissue. No associated in situ carcinoma (flat lesion) is seen. around the invasive tumor or in additional random sections of the bladder. All resection margins are free of both urothelial dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. K-s: See final microscopic-diagnosis. T CeA tumn contuis 1s% Agvnnouo. hiifu114
