Total number with metastasis: 7 Total number examined: 10 (1 from part A, 9 from part B below) Size of largest metastasis: 1.3 cm (A14, A15) Extracapsular extension: present and extends into fibrous septae of surrounding fibroadipose tissue Microcalcifications: associated with invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and sclerosing adenosis Other findings:. - Fibrocystic changes with ductal epithelial hyperplasia. - Sclerosing adenosis.. - Benign skeletal muscle.. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. B: Soft tissue, axillary contents, removal - Six of nine lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (6/9). - Largest metastatic focus 1.3 cm. - Extracapsular extension is present. Comment: Although two foci of carcinoma were previously identified radiologically (2.0 cm and 1.5 cm) and sampled by core biopsy, only one large focus of tumor is identified grossly in this mastectomy specimen. Gross examination has been repeated several times and additional sections submitted with no second tumor nodule identified. A second firm nodule was identified 3 cm away from the first, but microscopically it appeared to be sclerosing adenosis and this was confirmed with positive immunostaining with p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (A17). The current single focus of tumor is extremely fibrotic and measures 3.5 cm (which is equal to the two previously identified foci combined) Of the two foci initially seen, one was described as superficiai and the other deep, but they were very close to each other (10:00 and 9:00 to 10:00). The current large focus is located at 9:00 to 10:00 and extends from superficial to deep. Histologically, the tumor demonstrates morphologic features consistent with both of the previous core biopsies (predominant morphology is that of the "deep" core with some areas resembling the "superficial" core). The. different-appearing areas merge into each other and are part of the same nodule of tumor. Immunostain for e-cadherin was performed on a couple of areas that have lobular features (similar to the superficial core biopsy); it is positive, confirming the ductal phenotype of the tumor (A8, B3). Immunostain for AE1/AE3 was. performed on block B8 and confirms no metastatic tumor in that lymph node. Immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR and HER2/Neu were performed with the following results. These stains were performed on tumor that resembles the deep core biopsy, and results are similar to those from the deep core biopsy (except HER2 is 1+ instead of 0, but still considered negative). Material from an additional block (with areas resembling the superficial core) has been submitted to see if it stains similarly to the superficial core; the original superficia! core showed HER2 at 2+ and amplification by FiSH. These results will be reported in an addendum. Results:

Skin ellipse dimensions: 21.5 x 16.3 cm. Nipple/areola: 0.6 cm/3.4 cm, respectively. Axillary tail: absent. Biopsy site: not identified. Discrete Mass(es): present; one large firm mass is identified. The cut surface is tan with small areas of hemorrhage and fat necrosis. The mass is well demarcated and lobular in shape.. Number of discrete masses: one Size of mass (es)/biopsy site: 3.5 x 2.9 x 1.8 cm Location of mass(es): upper outer quadrant Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: 2.4 cm from the black inked posterior margin and 4.5 cm from the. closest blue inked anterior margin.. Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: absent. Description of remaining breast: The remainder of the breast tissue is predominantly yellow lobulated fat which is interspersed with delicate strands of white fibroconnective tissue.. Other remarkable features: There is an arterial graft in the subareolar breast tissue that runs from the superior to inferior aspects of the specimen. This graft is 11.7 cm long and 1.4 cm in diameter.. Tissue submitted for special investigations: tumor and normal tissue are submitted for. Addendum: On further gross examination, a second mass is identified. The second mass is approximately 3 cm medial ty the first mass. The second mass is a well circumscribed, white firm nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. This mass is 7.3 cm from the nearest blue inked anterior margin, 3.0 cm from the nearest black inked deep margin, and 3.0 cm from the skin. There is no evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis associated with this mass. (Histologically, this mass is sclerosing

Attending Pathologist: 1 have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).. Procedures/Addenda: Addendum Addendum The following addendum is issued to report the results of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu. immunohistochemical studies.. Results: Estrogen receptor () 1, clone SP1): Interpretation: Positive Computer-assisted quantitative score: 94% Progesterone receptor :. clone 1E2): Interpretation: Negative Computer-assisted quantitative score: 0% HER2/neu ( clone 4B5, FDA-approved): Interpretation: Positive (overexpressed) Computer-assisted quantitative score: 3+ (see note) NOte: This block (A5) includes areas that show morphologies similar to both the superficial and deep cores. ER and PR are. relatively homogeneous throughout the tumor, regardless of morphology. Immunostain for HER2 is heterogeneous, but staining does not correlate with any particular morphology. There is enough strong complete staining to interpret the. HER2 as 3+ (overexpressed); however, areas in this block range from no staining to strong and complete staining.
