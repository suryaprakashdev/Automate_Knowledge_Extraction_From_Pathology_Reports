NOTE: The tumor demonstrates combination of papillary and clear cell features. Foci of lympho-vascular invasion are scen.. The malignant cells show posilive immunoreactivity for CAM 5.2 ( palchy), CD10, CA IX (patchy, weak), Rasemase (. granular, patchy) while being negative for AE1/ AE3, HMB 45, CK7, RCC, 34BE12 and TFE3. The innunoprofile and morphological feaiures nosl compatible with unclassified type of renal cell carcinoma.. 2.

The kidney neasures 13.5 x 7.0 x 6.0 cn.The attached ureter measures 4.5 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The atlached renat vein measures 1.5 cm in lenglh and 1.0 cm in diameter and is grossly involved by tumor thrombus at the margin. The ureter margin is grossly unremarkable.  An adrenal Page 2 of 4

It has focal areas of necrosis, hemorrhage and cystic degeneration. Mulliple satellite nodules are  also identified. The lumor abuts the capsule and grossly involves the sinus and hilar fat . Sections through the remainder of the  kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a welldefined corticomedullary junction. The cortex measures O.7 cm and the. calyces appear normal. One lyimph node is identified and submitted. Representalive sections are submilled for TPS and for permanent sections. The specimen is photographed. 1 r i.
