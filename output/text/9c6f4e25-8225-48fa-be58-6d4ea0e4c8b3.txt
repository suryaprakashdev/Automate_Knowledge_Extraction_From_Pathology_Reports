SPECIMENS: A. LEFT COLON SPECIMEN(S): A. LEFT COLON INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: A-left colon: Tumor mass is 9 cm away from the distal margin, called by. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT COLON Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left colon" is a 24 cm segment of colon with circumference of 7.5 cm with a suture designating the distal margin. The serosa is unremarkable. The mesocolon and serosa, subjacent to the mass, is inked black. A 9 x 6.5 x 3cm circumferential, polypoid, indurated, necrotic mass is present, 9 cm from the distal margin, involving the subserosal fat. Proximal mucosa has diverticuli and 3 polyps, 0.2 cm, 0.3 cm, and 0.5 cm. A gross assessment is conveyed to O.. R., a photograph is taken, and tissue is procured. Representatively submitted: A1: shave of proximal margin A2: shave of distal margin A3-A8: mass A9: possible diverticuli A10: polyps A11: normal appearing mucosa extending into flattened mucosa. A12-A13: proximal, 6 possible lymph nodes in each cassette A14: proximal, 1 lymph node A15-A16: distal, 6 possible lymph nodes in each cassette. A17: distal, 4 lymph nodes DIAGNOSIS: COLON, LEFT, RESECTION: - INVASIVE MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED, ARISING IN A TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA - TUMOR MEASURES 9 X 6.5 X 3 CM. - TUMOR INVOLVES THE SUBSEROSA. - MARGINS, FREE OF TUMOR. - METASTASTIC CARCINOMA IN TWO OF 26 LYMPH NODES (2/26) - TWO TUBULAR ADENOMAS. - DIVERTICULOSIS. NOTE: On slide A3, mucin with fibrosis and marked inflammation is seen at an inked radial aspect that is fragmented. Tumor is not definitely identified at the radial margin. Dr. concurs. Clinical-surgical correlation is recommended. SYNOPTIC REPORT - COLON & RECTUM Specimen Type: Left hemicolectomy Tumor Site: Left (descending) colon Tumor Configuration: Exophytic (polypoid) Infiltrative Tumor size: 9cm Additional dimensions 6.5cm x 3cm WHO Classification Mucinous adenocarcinoma 8480/3 Histologic Grade: G2: Moderately differentiated Extent of Invasion:  Subserosa Margins: Margin(s) uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (Proximal, Distal, Radial).  Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Present Perineural Invasion: Absent Additional Pathologic Findings: Adenoma Extent of Resection:  Ro: Complete resection with grossly and microscopically negative margins Lymph Nodes: Positive 2 / 26 Extranodal extension: Absent
