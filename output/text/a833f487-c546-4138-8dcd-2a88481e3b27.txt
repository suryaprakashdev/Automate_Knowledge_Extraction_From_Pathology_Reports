The material in Block A is an invasive carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma of the colon, characterized here as a serrated adenocarcinoma of grade G2 with infiltration of the muscularis pT2 with vascular infiltration L1, V1. In the region of the mucosa, it also shows free mucosal margins with a regular mucosa, submucosa and muscularis and regular fatty connective tissue in the direction of the central ligature. The material in Block D is additonally a polyp characterized as a serrated adenoma without dysplasia (not a high-grade neoplasia), free lymph nodes with a marked resorptive lymphadenitis, in relation to the macroscopically named adjacent node likewise a regular lymph node and in relation to Block H the formation of a diverticulum, here typically in the sense of a pseudodiverticulum with an eversion between the gaps in the muscle wall. In relation to the the central resection margin: mature fatty connective tissue with dilated vessels and, in relation to the lymph nodes, a chronic resorptive lymphadenitis. Tumor classification: ICDO-DA-M G 2 pT2 L1, V1 pN0 (0 of 18 + 1) with complete local excision
