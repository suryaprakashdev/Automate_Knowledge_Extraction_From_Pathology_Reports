Clinical Diagnosis & History: Left renal mass. Specimens Submitted: 1:SPKidney,left and renal vein thrombusradical nephrectomy 2:SPLymph nodes,para-aorticexcision 3:SPVein, gonadal vein,segmental excision 4:SP:Adrenal glandleftexcision DIAGNOSIS: 1.. SPKidney, left and renal vein thrombus,radical nephrectomy Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma-Chromophobe type highgrade with extensive necrosis (see comment) Tumor Size: Greatest diameter is 12.5 cm. Local Invasion (for renal cortical types) Extends into renal pelvis Involves renal sinus fat Involves renal hilar fat Involves medium-sized veins in region of renal hilum Renal Vein Invasion: Identified Surgical Margins: Tumor is present at less than 1 mm from the stapled renal vein resection margin; the urothelium at the ureteral margin is partially denuded Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Unremarkable Adrenal Gland: Not identified See part4 Lymph Nodes: Free of tumor Number of nodes examined:1 Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma: pT3b Tumor grossly extends into the renal vein(s) or vena cava below the diaphragm Page1of4

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Comment:Although there is no sarcomatoid differentiation,there is focal significant epithelial anaplasia and a high nuclear grade.The tumor also demonstrates a high proliferation index evidenced by the Ki-67 immunostain 2. SP:Lymph nodes,para-aortic,excision Lymph Nodes: Number of nodes examined:30 Number of metastatic nodes:2 The largest metastatic node is 1.5cm Perinodal (extracapsular) extension identified The metastatic focus measures 1.2 cm in greatest extent 3.SP:Vein, gonadal vein,segmental excision -Benign segment of vein SP:Adrenal glandleft, excision 4. -Benign adrenal gland Note: This case was reviewed at the GU pathology consensus conference held IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OFTHE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL).AND THAT IHAVE REVIEWEDAND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment MIB-1 Ki-67 IRON MELF-M IMM RECUT NEG CONT Gross Description: 1).The specimen is received fresh labeled "left kidney and renal vein thrombus" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 633 g in total.The kidney measures 13.9 x 7.2 x 7.8 cm.The attached ureter measures 3.5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 4.5 cm in length and 3.5 cm in diameter. The ureteral margin is grossly unremarkable.However immediately adjacent (less than 0.1 cm) to the renal vein staple line is a large yellowish-brown tumor thrombus measuring 3.5 cm in length and 2.5 cm in diameter.An adrenal gland is not identified. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a large necrotic mult-nodular tan-yellow tumor involving the superior and inferior poles, the renal pelvis and hilum and the renal vein measuring 12.5 x 7.5 x 6.4 cm. The tumor appears to penetrate the capsule. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a poorly-defined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.9 cm. No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric fat.Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.

Representative sections of the largest lymph nodes are submitted.The remainder of the lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

The specimen is received in formalin labeled Portion of left gonadal vein".It consists of a brown tan tubular structure measuring 5.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter, with attached yellow-tan fatty tissue measuring up to 1.5 cm in thickness. Cross sections show an unremarkable luminal aspect.Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: U-undesignated 4).The specimen is received in formalin labeledLeft adrenalgland.It consists of a 7 x 3 x2 cm yellow-tan adrenal gland, with scant attached yellow-tan fatty tissue.The outer surface of the specimen shows a slightly ragged appearance.On cross sectioning,it shows unremarkable yellow parenchyma.Representative sections are submitted.
