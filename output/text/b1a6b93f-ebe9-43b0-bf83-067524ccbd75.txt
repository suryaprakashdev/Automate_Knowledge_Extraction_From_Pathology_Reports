UUID:B07B7F9E-9DC0-4FA2-88C3-6159A85206BB Department of Pathology -AAVK-01A-PR Redacted Tissue Source Site (TSS) #: Pathoigy Accession No: Patient ID: Normal Sample ID: Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS (A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND RIGHT ADRENAL: RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (7.5 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION), PAPILLARY TYPE 2, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, INVASIVE INTO RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE No tumor invasion into renal vein or perinephric adipose tissue. METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA INVOLVING ONE OF ONE HILAR LYMPH NODE (1/1) Margins of resection (ureteral, vascular, perinephric soft tissue), no tumor present. Adrenal gland, no tumor present. (B) PARACAVAL AND RETROCAVAL LYMPH NODE: METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA INVOLVING FOUR OF SIX LYMPH NODES (4/6) GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND RIGHT ADRENAL -- A radical nephrectomy specimen (20 x 15 x 5 cm) including the right kidney (12 x 7 x 5 cm), segment of the renal artery, renal vein, and ureter (8 cm in length and 0.8 cm in average diameter), and a separate. adrenal gland (7 x 2.5 x 1 cm). There is a 7.5 x 6.5 x 5 cm well-circumscribed tumor in the lower pole of the kidney. The tumor is brown-red with.  approximately 75% hemorrhage and necrosis, which are present predominantly in the center of the tumor. The tumor appears confined to the kidney. The tumor does, however, bulge into the renal sinus. The renal vein appears grossly uninvolved. The. tumor does not extend into Gerota's fascia.. The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. A. single candidate lymph node (0.4 cm) is identified in the hilum of the kidney. Serial sections of the right adrenal gland show unremarkable cortex and medulla. Portions of tumor and normal kidney are submitted for research purposes. INK CODE:Black- Gerota's fascia. SECTION CODE: A1, ureter, renal artery and renal vein margins, en face; A2, A3, tumor adjacent to renal vein; A4, A5, tumor bulging into renal sinus; A6, tumor with possible involvement of vessel; A7, tumor in renal pelvis; A8, A9, tumor bulging into fat with overlying inked margin; A10, tumor with renal capsule; A11, tumor bulging into renal sinus; A12, tumor/normal kidney; A13, tumor with renal capsule; A14, normal kidney; A15, possible hilar lymph node; A16, right adrenal gland. (B) PARACAVAL AND RETROCAVAL LYMPH NODE - A 4.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue which yields multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely.. SECTION CODE: B1, two lymph nodes; B2, three lymph nodes; B3, B4, one lymph node serially sectioned.
