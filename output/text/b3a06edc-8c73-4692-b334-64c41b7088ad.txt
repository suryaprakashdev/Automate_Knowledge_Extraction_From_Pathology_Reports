The tumor exhibits a predominant papillary architecture, lined by cells with a variably eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm. Areas with solid pattern of growth, also with clear cell features, are present Scattered calcifications are seen. Within the solid areas, some tumor cells exhibit spindling and atypia, compatible with focal sarcomatoid de-differentiation. Immunohistochemical stains for the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, EMA (focal), racemase (p504s), vimentin and pAx-8 (focal). A stain for p63 is negative.

Received fresh labeled and "tumor thrombus. left renal vein," are two portions of soft gray-tan somewhat friable tissue, 1.5 cm and 1.8 cm. Sampled in one cassette labeled B. Received fresh labeled and "left kidney. and periaortic nodes" is a radical nephrectomy specimen, 1050 g including the surrounding perinephric fat and attached periaortic lymph node tissue. The kidney without attached fat is 295 g and 12.5 x 8 x 6.5 cm. The attached ureter is 10 x 1 cm. The kidney has a circumscribed exophytic mass in the lower pole that is 4.2 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm. The mass grossly appears to extend into the adjacent perinephric fat. There is not definitive gross extension beyond Gerota's fascia. The tumor does not definitively extend into the renal sinus fat. The hilar vasculature and intrarenal vessels are thrombosed. The renal vein also contains thrombus and is somewhat suggestive of tumor thrombus. The leading edge of the thrombus within the renal vein is rounded and the margin is not grossly involved by tumor. Within the hilar soft tissue and adjacent s tissue is a matted mass of tumor-replaced lymph nodes. This is up to 14 x 5.5 x 5 cm. Additional tumor nodules are identified within the perinephric fat and immediately adjacent to the attached adrenal gland. The renal pelvis is hyperemic and slightly granular; however, there is no grossly evident mass.
