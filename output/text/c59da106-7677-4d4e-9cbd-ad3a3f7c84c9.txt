Examination reveals a single soft to. rubbery pink and tan lymph node measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. A single touch imprint slide is forwarded for microscopic evaluation. The lymph node is entirely subrnilted for routine histology with a sentinel node protocol pertormed, on A1 and A2 B. Part B designated left axillary tissue. Received in formalin is a 4 gram portion of yellow-tan fibrofatty  sof tissue measuring 3.8 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm. Examination reveals softened yellow-tan fat, without prominent Iymph node content. The fatly tissue is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation for possible minute. lymph node content, in B1-B3 C. Received in the fresh state tor tumor harvest for. tumor bank.
