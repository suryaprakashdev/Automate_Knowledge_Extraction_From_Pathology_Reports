 Page 2 of 4 I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1.) The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Sigmoid colon". It consists of a 18.2 cm in length and a 5.5 cm in circumference of rectosigmoid colon. The serosa is glistening, smooth, tan-pink. The serosal surface is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a 5.3 (l) x 5.5 (w) cm, well-circumscribed, centrally cavitated and necrotic, serpiginous bordered, sessile mass, located 9.5 cm from the (probable) distal margin, occupying the full circumference of the lumen (designated Mass #1).  Serial sectioning reveals Mass #1 to invade through the muscularis into the ricolonic fat, to a depth of cm, which is  2.8 cm from the closest radial margin. In addition, 1.1 cm distal to Mass #l, is a 0.4 (l) x 0.4 (w), well-circumscribed, smooth, homogenous tan nodule, located 3.9 cm away. from the distal margin (designated Nodule #1). Sectioning reveals Nodule #1 to remain confined to the mucosa. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection. Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. Tps is submitted for Mass #l.. Summary of sections:. PM (probable) proximal margin DM (probable) distal margin RM -- radial margin M1 Mass #1 N1 -- Nodule #1 M1N1 Mass #1 and Nodule #1  -- uninvolved mucosa P1 pedicle one lymph nodes BP1  bisected pedicle one lymph nodes P2pedicle two lymph nodes BP2bisected pedicle two lymph nodes 2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal margin" and consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2 x 1.8 x 1 cm.. Multiple sutures and staples are attached.  The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.

Page 3 of 4 3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal margin" and consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. At the center of the pin, a white plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan soft tissue is attached measuring 1.5 x 1 cm. The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and smooth Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U--undesignated Summary of Sections: Part 1: SP: Sigmoid colon (nyt) Block Sect.

MSH2 : Staining present  in tumor MSH6: Staining present in tumor PMS2 : Staining present in tumor Conclusion: Immunohistochemical staining for the tested DNA mismatch repair proteins is retained in the tumor. Some of the immunohistochemistry and Ish tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the Us Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not under the Clinical Laboratory. Improvement Amendments of ** End of Report
