Surgical Pathology Report ***Electronically Signed Out*** COMMENT #1: There is one small focus of invasive carcinoma at the edge of a fragment (0.6mm, confirmed by negative calponin and p63 immunostain), with severe cautery artefact, which was not seen on frozen section. The tumor is surrounded by fatty tissue, and thus would be regarded as negative final margin for specimen #4. #2: There is single focus of micrometastasis in the SLN #1. This focus is only present in slide 2B CTD2, and not on other levels, frozen smears and cytokeratin immunostained slides. 88307x5, 88305, 88331, 88332, 88333x2, 88342x3 Clinical Diagnosis and History: Right breast cancer 10 o'clock cT2,cNI,cMo, clinical stage 2B Tissue(s) Submitted: 1: SUPERFICIAL RIGHT AXILLARY BREAST TISSUE 2: RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 3: RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 4: RIGHT BREAST LONG STITCH LATERAL SHORT STITCH SUPERIORE 5: LEFT BREAST LONG STITCH LATERAL SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR 6: RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS Gross Description: Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name and superficial right axillary breast tissue, and consists of a 2.7 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm tan-yellow lobulated adipose tissue which is entirely submitted for frozen section analysis labeled 1AFS-1BFS. Specimen #2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name and right axillary sentinal lymph node #1, and consists of a single tan-pink, nodular tissue consistent with lymph node measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and two intraoperative smears are performed. The specimen is entirely submitted labeled 2A-2B. Specimen #3 is received fresh on a blue surgical towel for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name and right axillary sentinal lymph node #2, and consists of a singie tan-pink, nodular tissue consistent with lymph node measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and an intraoperative smear is prepared. The specimen is entirely submitted labeled 3A-3B. Specimen #4 is received fresh for formalin, labeled with the patient's name and right breast, long stitch lateral, short stitch superior, and consists of a 520 gram, 18 (superior to inferior) by 17 (medial to lateral) by 4 (anterior to posterior) cm right mastectomy specimen. A short suture designating superior, and a long suture designating lateral are present. A 14 x 4.5 x 0.3 cm white-tan, unremarkable ellipse of skin is identified containing a 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm unremarkable, everted nipple. The areola measures 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is differentially inked as follows: superior/anterior -- blue, inferior/anterior -- green, posterior/deep -- black and serially sectioned from lateral to medial to reveal a 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.1 cm firm, tan-pink, irregular mass at the 10 o'clock position. This mass is focally 0.2 cm from the posterior, 0.2 cm from the superior/anterior, and greater than 4 cm from the inferior margins. The mass is present in multiple sections and is seen to extend more centrally. No other lesions are grossly identified. The surrounding breast parenchyma consists of white, fibrous tissue (60%) and tan lobular adipose tissue (40%). Time in formalin: 14:20. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 4A-4B:  Mass closest to superior/anterior and deep margins, contiguous section 4C: Mass to deep margin 4D: Mass to superior/anterior margin. 4E: Mass to deep margin 4F-4G: Tumor without margin 4H: Mass to deep. 41: Tumor without margin 4J: Inferior margin closest to tumor 4K-4L: Fibrous tissue immediately medial to mass. 4m: Fibrous tissue in central breast 4N: Fibrous tissue in medial most breast.

Surgical Pathology Report 40: Nipple and skin section closest to mass. 4p: Outer upper quadrant 4Q: Outer lower quadrant 4R:  Inner upper quadrant 4S: Inner lower quadrant Specimen #5 is received fresh for formalin, labeled with the patient's name and left breast, long stitch lateral, short stitch superior, and consists of a 550-gram, 20 (superior to inferior) by 15.9 (medial to lateral) by 5.4 (anterior to posterior) product of left mastectomy. An unremarkable, tan ellipse of skin is identified measuring 13.3 x 4.2 x 0.2 cm. The everted nipple measures 1 x 0.9 cm and resides within a 4 x 2.9 cm areola. The specimen is differentially inked as follows: superior/anterior -- blue, inferior/anterior -- green, posterior/deep -- black and serially sectioned from medial to lateral to reveal no distinct mass but areas consistent with fibrocystic changes containing blue domed cysts averaging 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. The surrounding breast parenchyma consists of tan-yellow lobulated adipose tissue (60%) and white, fibrous areas (40%). No other lesions are grossly identified. Time in formalin:. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 5A: Nipple 5B: Outer upper quadrant 5C: Inner upper quadrant 5D: Inner lower quadrant 5E: Outer lower quadrant 5F-5L: Fibrous areas 5M: Superior margin to fibrous area. 5N: Deep margin to fibrous area. 50: Inferior margin to fibrous area. Specimen #6 is received fresh on a blue surgical towel, labeled with the patient's name and right axillary contents, and consists of multiple tan-pink, nodular tissues consistent with lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm in greatest dimension. All grossly identifiable lymph nodes are submitted as follows: 6A-B:  One lymph node, bisected, each cassette. 6C-6D: One lymph node, bisected 6E-F: One lymph node, bisected, each cassette. 6G-H: Intact lymph nodes Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis 1A-1B/FSDX: BENIGN BREAST TISSUE AND FAT; NO MALiGNANCY. 2A/GDX/SMDX: NEGATIVE LYMPH NODE (0/1) 3A/GDX/SMDX: POSITIVE LYMPH NODE (1/1). Amendments Amended:  Reason: Further review of case. SLN #2 should be counted as multiple micromet Previous Signout Date: Page 3 of 3 END OF REPORT
