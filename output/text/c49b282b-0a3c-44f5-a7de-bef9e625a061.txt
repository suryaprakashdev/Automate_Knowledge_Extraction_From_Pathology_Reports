Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1" and cOnsists of a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm lymph node. One half of the node is submitted for the cacp protocol. The remainder is submitted in cassette Al. B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2" and consists of a 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm fragment of fatty tissue containing a 0.2 cm lymph node. The specimen is bisected and submitted in its entirety for paraffin section in one cassette. c. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, "RIGHT BREAST ONE TAG MEDIAL, TWO TAGS SUPERIOR" and cOnsists of a 505.0 designated gram simple mastectomy specimen, measuring 19.7 cm superior to inferior, 19.8 cm medial to lateral, and 2.2 cm anterior to posterior. The overlying ellipse of nipple bearing skin measures 10.5 x 5.2 cm, which is tagged for its abnormalities. Ink code: Superior superficial=blue, inferior superficial-orange, deep-black. Sectioning reveals a 2.4 x 2.4 x 1.7 cm well-circumscribed, tan tumor in the central portion of the upper outer quadrant, 0.6 cm from the deep margin. The tumor is surrounded by dense fibrous tissue, which extends medially to the inner portions of the breast. Within this fibrous tissue in the central portion of the breast (1.0 to 2.0 cm from the tumor and 1.5 cm from the deep margin) is a 0.7 cm Mammomark site without associated mass. Representative sections are submitted in 13 cassettes as follows: C1: Skin, lateral tip.. c2: Tumor, upper outer quadrant. c3: Tumor with deep margin upper outer quadrant. C4: Tumor with deep margin upper outer quadrant.. C5: Fibrous tissue immedial medial to tumor.. C6: Mammomark biopsy site.. c7: Mammomark biopsy site.. c8: Deep margin underlying Mammomark site. c9: Random fibrous tissue lower inner quadrant. C10: Random fibrous tissue upper inner quadrant.. C11: Random fibrofatty tissue upper outer quadrant peripheral.. C12: Random fibrofatty tissue lower outer quadrant.. C13: Cross section of nipple. Page 2 Continued on Next Page.
