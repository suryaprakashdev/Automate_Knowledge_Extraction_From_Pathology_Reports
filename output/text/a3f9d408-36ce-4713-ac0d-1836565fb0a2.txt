. Unremarkable adrenal gland. 3. SP: Lymph nodes, Para-arotic, excision Lymph Nodes:  Number of nodes examined:11 Number of metastatic nodes:6 The largest melastatic node is 3.5cm  Perinodal (extracapsular) extension identified ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL).ANO IHAT IHAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVEO THIS REPORT Gross Description: 1) The spccimen is received lresh labeled "lefl kidney" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric Iat weighing 285 g in total. The kidney measures 10.0 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm. 1he attached ureter measures 2.5 cm in length and 0.5 cn  in diameter. The attached renal yein measures 0.8 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are. grossly unremarkabie. An adrenal gland is not identified grossly. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal an ill-defined bright-yellow tumor, tocated at mid portion of xidney and protruding oul and involving the perinephric fat, measuring 7.5 x 5.5 x 5.0. cm. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a well-defined corlico-medullary junction.. The cortex measures 1.0 cm and the calyces appear normal. No lymph nodes are identified in the perinephric fat. Represenlalive sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.. Summary of sections:  UVM -- ureteral and vessel margins tumor THF-- tumor with hilar fat TSF -- tumor with sinus fat. TK -- tunor with adjacent kidney RP -- renal pelvis representative sections K -- representative sections kidney F-hilar fat 2) The specimen is received fresh labeled *Lelt suprahilar, and hilar lymph node and left adrenal'. It consists of a segment of yellow-tan fatly lobular tissue containing the adrenal gland and adjacenl encapsulated, seemingly intact red-brown mass. The Overall dimensions of the specimen are 14.5 x 5 x 3 cm. The adrenal measures 4.5 x 1.2 x 1 .0 cm, and on cut section shows. unremarkable yellow orange appearance. The red-brown mass measures 4 x 4 x 3 cm, is located directly adjacent to the adrenal gland, but does not show any definile involvement of the gland. The outer surface of the mass is inked black. On cul seclion of. the mass, it shiows cystic, markedly friable dark red hemorrhagic appearance filled with hemorrhagic naterial No lynph nodes are grossly idenlified. Representative seclions are submitted.. A sample of the mass is given to TPS. The specimen has been photographed. Summary of sections: ADR-adrenal M-Mass ADRM-adrenal and mass 3). The specimen is received in formalin labeled *Para-aortic tyinph nodes*. It consisls of multiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.3 cm up to 3.5 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimensions. Cut section of one of the largost lymph nodes shows moltled yellow orange lo.  Page 2 0f 3

The iargesl lymph node is.  quadrisecled to show predominantly yellow-tan falty lobular appearance with tocal firm white-tan areas. After the largest lymph node is quadrisected, each of the sections is bisected. The remainder of the lymph nodes are entirely submitled.. Summary of sections:.
