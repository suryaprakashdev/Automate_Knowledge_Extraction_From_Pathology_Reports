PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "RIGHT KIDNEY": RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear cell type (5.5 cm), Fuhrman nuclear grade II/IV. No capsular or perirenal soft tissue invasion present. The tumor invades the renal vein and is present at the renal vein margin. The renal artery, ureter, and Gerota's fascia resection margins are negative for tumor.. AJCC Classification (6th Edition): T3b Nx MX. Adrenal gland with no significant pathologic change. The non-neoplastic kidney wili be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the findings will be reported in an addendum. CLINICAL DATA: History: with renal tumor. Operation: Right radical nephrectomy.. Operative Findings:  Not given. clinical Diagnosis: Right renal cancer. TISSUE SUBMITTED: A/1. Right kidney GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and unit. number, and consists of a 1347-gram, 28.0 x 13.0 x 8.0 cm riqht nephrectomy specimen, partially surfaced by freely-mobile, smooth, tan/white Gerota's fascia (2o.5 x 14.0 cm, inked black), and with abundant attached perirenal adipose tissue (soft tissue margin inked blue).  The right kidney (13.5 x 6.5 x 5.9 cm) demonstrates a well-circumscribed, seemingly encapsulated, 5.5 x 4.5 x. 4.0 cm, yellow/orange, lobulated, multifocally hemorrhagic, solid tumor in the. upper pole, which abuts and expands but does not grossly appear to invade the. renal capsule. The tumor grossly invades multiple branches of the renal vein, including the main vessel, and is present at the renal vein margin. The closest Gerota's fascia is within 0.3 cm; the closest blue-inked soft tissue margin is within 2.5 cm. There are no grossly apparent satellite nodules noted upon sectioning the remaining renal parenchyma.  The corticomedullary junction. is distinct. The renal pelvis is lined by hemorrhagic, otherwise unremarkable urothelium. 0.3 cm of grossly involved renal vein (diameter 1.8 cm) extends from the renal hilum along with 0.3 cm of renal artery (diameter of o.3 cm). and 3 cm of right ureter (diameter is 0.6 cm).  Separately received with the. specimen is a questionably complete, 5.9 x 1.9 x 0.4 cm, disrupted adrenal gland.  In addition, there are multiple fragments of smooth, nodular tumor and clotted blood received in the specimen container (aggregating 6.5 x 6.5 x 3.0  Representative tumor has been submitted to the tissue bank. Representative tumor is submitted for cytogenetics studies and held for possible electron microscopy studies.  Representative normal cortex has been submitted to the tissue bank, EM, and IF. Representative normal medulla has. been submitted to the tissue bank. The specimen has been photographed. Micro Al: Vascular, ureteral margins (excepting renal vein), multi frags Micro A2: Tumor at renal vein margin (inked blue), en face, 1 frag, Micro A3: Tumor and renal capsule, nearest blue inked soft tissue margin, frags, Micro A4:  Tumor and nearest Gerota's fascia (inked black), 1 fraq,

ADDENDUM TO REPORT RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: RIGHT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY: ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE TO SEVERE, VASOCONSTRICTION, AND JUXTAGLOMERULAR CELL HYPERPLASIA (See NOTE) MILD TO MODERATE CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA, INCLUDING: -FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MILD, PREDOMINANTLY SUBCAPSULAR, AND MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO VASCULAR DISEASE (3.1% OF GLOMERULI) ; TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS, MODERATE (20% OF) PARENCHYMA). WITH SUBCAPSULAR FIBROSIS NOTE : Chronic changes: Moderately advanced chronic changes are present, including global glomerulosclerosis affecting 3.1t of glomeruli, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis affecting 2os of the cortical parenchyma, and a mild degree of vascular scarring, including subcapsular fibrosis. Because these. changes are a result of functional adaptations to nephron loss from any glomerular, tubular, interstitial, vascular, or mass-replacing process, similar degree of chronic damage would be expected in the contralateral kidney. In this case the vascular changes are significant, with arterial and arteriolar. sclerosis, moderate to severe.. The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:S Light Microscopy: Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A7) were evaluated using H&E, PAS,. silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains.. The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 224 glomeruli present, of. which 7 (3.1t) are globally sclerosed, and 1 show segmentai glomerulosclerosis. The remaining glomeruli show mild expansion of the mesangial areas. There are no discernible craters or double contours of the glomerular capillary wall basement membranes. There is juxtaglomerular cell hyperplasia.' Several distal. tubules contain PAs-positive hyaline casts. The interstitium contains a mild mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate in areas of tubular atrophy. Approximately 20t of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis with subcapsular fibrosis mild. Arteries and arterioles exhibit moderate to severe degree of sclerosis..
