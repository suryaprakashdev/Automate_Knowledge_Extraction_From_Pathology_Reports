Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS (A) LEFT KIDNEY, ADRENAL, AND PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES: CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (11.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), EOSINOPHILIC VARIANT, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 4, INVASIVE INTO PERINEPHRIC ADIPOSE TISSUE AND RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE, WITH VASCULAR-LYMPHATIC INVASION. (SEE COMMENT) METASTATIC CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IN 3 HILAR LYMPH NODES. Adrenal gland, no tumor present. Margins of resection free of tumor. (B) SPLEEN: Spleen with vascular congestion, no tumor present. The chromophobe renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney extensively invades into the perinephric adipose tissue, including around the adrenal gland. However, tumor does not invade directly into the adrenal gland. Tumor is also present within the renal sinus adipose tissue. The renal vein is free of tumor. The lymph nodes are extensively involved by chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stain for EMA is strongly positive in the tumor cells. Cytokeratin 7 is positive in a minority of the tumor. CD10 is focally positive, including rare cells that show a membranous staining pattern. Vimentin is negative. Electron microscopy shows that the tumor is made of cuboidal cells with abundant cytoplasm containing a large number of mitochondria with tubular cristae. The cytoplasm contains a large number of microvesicles. The ultrastructural features of the tumor are those of a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, eosinophilic variant. The electron microscopy was performed by Dr GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT KIDNEY, ADRENAL, AND PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODE - A radical nephrectomy specimen consisting of a left kidney (28.0 x 17.0 x 10.0 cm) and associated adrenal gland (7.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm). Within the renal hilum is an aggregate of enlarged. lymph nodes (8.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm). Within the upper pole and mid-portion of kidney is an 11.0 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm, lobulated, relatively well-circumscribed tumor which extends through the renal capsule into the perinephric fat, including around the adrenal gland. The tumor grossly involves the renal sinus. The cut surface of the tumor has a variegated appearance, with tan-pink fleshy areas as well as gray-brown necrotic areas (necrotic areas comprise less than 10% of tumor). Other areas have thickened gray-white fibrous septa which traverse the tumor. The ureteral and vascular margins are grossly free of tumor. The renal vein is free of tumor. Three hilar lymph nodes are grossly involved with tumor and measure 4.8 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, 2.5 x 2.0 x 2.8 cm, and 1.6 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm, respectively.. The cut surface of the positive lymph nodes have a pink-tan fleshy appearance. The renal tissue away from the tumor is pale brown and unremarkable. The cortex has a thickness of 0.8 cm, and the corticomedullary junction is well-delineated. SECTION CODE: A1-A4, tumor extending into perinephric fat; A5, tumor with gray-white fibrous septa; A6, tumor in perinephric fat; A7, tumor and adrenal; A8-A10, tumor and renal sinus; A11, tumor with area of necrosis; A12, tumor/ normal. kidney interface; A13, tumor; A14-A16, largest lymph node; A17, smaller lymph node, representative section; A18, smaller lymph node, representative section; A19, renal vascular and ureteral margins; A20, A21, uninvolved renal tissue. (B) SPLEEN - An 11.5 x 7.8 x 5.0 cm spleen which has an intact smooth gray capsule and a purple unremarkable cut surface. No  masses are present. The hilum contains a small amount of adipose tissue. Representative sections are submitted in B1-B4.. CLINICAL HISTORY Mass, left renal..
