Comment: The neoplasm is comprised of sheets of cells with pleomorphic. nuclei without nucleoli. The .neoplastic cells have eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm with perinuclear clearing, and distinct cellular borders. Immunostains show reactivity for ck7 and cDll7, with no reactivity for vimentin or Rcc. There is focal cytoplasmic reactivity for colloidal iron. Morphologic and. immunophenotypic findings support a diagnosis of eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, and serve to exclude oncocytoma, conventional Rcc, and type 2 papillary Rcc. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis: A frozen section consultation was requested by Dr. in FsAl: Lymph node, left periaortic, biopsy - No tumor seen Drs. at Frozen Section Pathologist:, Clinical History: year-old female with possible Tlb renal cell carcinoma. Gross Description: Received are three appropriately labeled containers. Container A is received fresh for frozen section, and additionally labeled "left periaortic lymph node." It holds a 1.9 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm lymph node candidate which is bisected and totally submitted in block FsAl, Container B is additionally labeled "left para-aortic lymph. node." It holds a 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm aggregate of tan to yellow. fatty soft tissue fragments. Dissecting the fat reveals multiple. lymph node candidates ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 cm in greatest. dimension. Block summary:. B1 - largest lymph node candidate, serially sectioned B2,B3 - multiple lymph node candidates Fat remains in the container. Container c is additionally labeled "left renal mass." It holds a partial nephrectomy specimen (6.2 x 6.0 x 4.3 cm, 78 grams).

The external surface is a smooth tan renal capsule with no disruptions. The capsule is inked black and the renal parenchymal margin is inked blue. The specimen is serially. sectioned to reveal an encapsulated, roughly spherical mass that comprises the majority of the specimen (6.0 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm). The mass has a heterogeneous tan/brown cut surface with numerous areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The mass abuts and distorts the capsule, but does not appear to disrupt the renal capsule. The fibrous capsule of the mass extends to the renal parenchymal margin but does not appear to invade. Representative sections of the mass at the capsule are submitted in blocks c1 and c2, and representative sections of the mass at the renal parenchymal. margin are submitted in blocks c3 and c4..
