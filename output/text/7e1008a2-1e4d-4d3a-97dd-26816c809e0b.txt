These ASRs are clinically. useful indicators that do not require FDA approval. These clones are used: ID5=ER, PgR 636=PR, A485=HER2, H-11=EGFR, CCH2/DDG9=CMV, F39.4.1=AR and HPV by ISH. All immunohistochemical stains are used with formalin or molecular fixed. paraffin embedded tissue. Detection is by LSAB. The results are read by a pathologist as positive. or negative. XXX Procedures/Addenda Addendum Date Ordered: xx Status: Signed Out Date Complete: xx Date Reported: xx Addendum Diagnosis A. LEft brEaSt NEedLe LOCALIZAtIon LumpecTOMY: Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed tissue with the following results for [invasive. carcinoma/DCIS/metastatic carcinoma] (block xx): Estrogen receptor

ID5 POSITIVE (> 90%)  Progesterone receptor PgR 636 POSITIVE (1 -10 %) HER-2/neu (c-erb-B2) NEGATIVE 0 B. hOt SpOt #1, AXiLLA i, CT-xx: Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed tissue with the following results for metastatic carcinoma (block B): Keratin: NEGATIVE (see note). Note: A single cell that appears to be keratin positive is present in the subcapsular space. However, the nuclear size  and morphology of this cell is different than the primary tumor cells. Selected slides were reviewed with Dr. XX and concurs with the diagnosis. C. hOt SpOT #1, AXILLA I CT -xx: Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed tissue with the following results for metastatic carcinoma (C): Keratin: NEGATIVE. Interpretation Guidelines: For hormone receptor immunohistochemical analysis, the percent of immunoreactive  nuclei in the invasive or in-situ carcinoma is assessed manually by light microscopic examination and reported as follows: Positive: greater than or equal to 1 percent of nuclei immunoreactive Negative: less than 1 percent of nuclei immunoreactive.  Non-neoplastic mammary epithelial cells are immunoreactive for estrogen and progesterone receptors (internal control). For HER2/neu immunohistochemical analysis, the cell membrane staining is assessed manually by light microscopic examination. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity alone is scored as a negative result.. Reference #1: XX Reference #2: XX Clinical History: Infiltrating lobular cancer in ieft breast. Please evaluate margins of lumpectomy. If sentinel nodes are negative, do immunohistochemistry.

Received fresh and labeled "Left breast lumpectomy" is a yellow-tan irregular-shaped lumpectomy,  measuring 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm and weighing 35.0 grams. The specimen is inked as follows: superior margin inked blue, inferior margin inked green, medial margin inked red, lateral margin inked orange, anterior/superficial margin inked yellow and deep margin inked black. Sections reveal an ill-defined area with firm to hard consistency, 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. This area is located toward the medial to posterior resection margin at 0.2 to 0.3 cm from the deep resection margin (nearest), 0.3 cm from the inferior resection margin, 3.0 cm from lateral resection margin, 2.0 cm from the superior resection margin, 1.0 cm from the superficial resection margin. The remainder of the specimen is homogeneous, yellow-tan, grossly unremarkable adipose tissue. No other suspicious lesions are present. The specimen is submitted in nine cassettes, as follows: Cassette #1-3: Tissue with clip in toto. Cassette #4: Perpendicular section superior margin Cassette #5: Perpendicular section inferior margin Cassette #6: Perpendicular section medial margin Cassette #7: Perpendicular section lateral margin Cassette #8: Perpendicular section superficial margin Cassette #9: Perpendicular section deep margin B.  Received in formalin and labeled "Hot spot #1, axilla I, ct xx' is a yellow-tan irregular-shaped soft tissue fragment, 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. Sections reveal one lymph node, 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The lymph node is bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette. C.  Received in formalin and labeled "Hot spot #1, axilla I, ct xx" is a yellow-tan irregular-shaped soft tissue fragment, 2.8 x2.0 x 1.0 cm. Sections reveal one lymph node, 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. the lymph node is bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette. xXX
