RESULTS: Fiuorescence in situ hybridization (FiSH) analysis was oerformed on a formalin-fixed Block 1B (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00) using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene'  An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were present and evaluated by four independent observers. The ratio of HtR-2/NEU signals (ERBB2) to chromosome 17 centromere. signals 1 . was determined to be 1.69. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be amplified with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in. the equivocal range; therefore, this speclmen is not amplified. The average number of HER-2/NEU signals per cell was 4.10. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.43. Many af the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for  both the HER-2/NEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploidy or aneuploidy tor chromosome 17." Concurrent positive and negative controi specimens showed the expected results. This FISH test is perforned using a modification of the Vysis FDA approved PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (1:2 LSI HER-2/neu / CEP17 orobe : T-denhyb-2 buffer). This FisH test was developed and Its performance determined by the  Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA '88, this laboratory has established and vennea tne test's accuracy and precision. Criteria
