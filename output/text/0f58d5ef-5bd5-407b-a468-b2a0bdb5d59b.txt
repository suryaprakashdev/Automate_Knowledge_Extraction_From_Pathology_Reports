IcD-o-3 Ooderolipqleomo NOS 0 945of3 Tumor ID Sute c8cF Supstirtorial NOS C710 c71.2 9) 4116|13 Microscopic Description: Sections demonstrate a variably cellular glioma that diffusely infiltrates both the gray and white matter. The majority of the tumor cells demonstrate prominent perinuclear halos. They consistently have round to oval nuclei. Atypia is moderate. Cellularity is accentuated in a multinodular pattern. Neither microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are identified. A few scattered mitotic figures are seen, but these are insufficient by themselves to warrant classification as anaplastic. Scattered MiB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. However, even in the most proliferative regions, a labeling index of only 2.2% is calculated. Combined with the other histologic features, this does not warrant classification as anaplastic/grade ll. Nevertheless, the cluster of hypercellularity and degree of atypia is somewhat worrisome and close follow up is indicated. Diagnosis: UUID:34BD1967-CF9D-4B21-866A-B8100739E1C9 TCGA-HT-A615-01A-PR Redacted Left Temporal Tumor Oligodendroglioma, Grade II MI8-1 Labeling Index= 2.2%
