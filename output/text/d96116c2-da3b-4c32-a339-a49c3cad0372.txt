LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY: Received fresh state a specimen labelled with patient's name and identification number as above,and Iabelled "LEFT KIDNEY ,Specimen consist of a left radical nephrectomy specimen comprised of left kidney with abundant perinephric fat , attached ureter and left adrenal gland with a combined weight of 1400 grams. The specimen measures 21 x 13 x 11.5 cm. The attached ureter measures 3 cm. in length and 1 cm. in diameter. Adrenal gland measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. grossly is not remarkable. Mucosa of ureter,and hilar blood vessels are not remarkable. .The specimen when bisected,located along the upper pole is a 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm. solid mass with creamy yellowish cut surface .Grossly the tumor appears confined within kidney parenchyma. The cortex shows distorsion by various size cyst and marked fatty infiltration of medullary area.Cysts ranging in size from 0.2cm to 2.5 cm. Some cysts display golden-yellow discoloration around the gray-tan lining. .The parirenal fat is difficult to separate from the renal capsule. Multiple section are submitted in cassttes labelled as follows: A1: ureteral and vascular margins A2-A6: sections from tumor in toto A7-A13: sections from cyst A14: sections from adrenal gland A15-A16: presumptive lymph nodes DIAGNOSIS: A.
