UUID: BC211027-32C2-4E6B-BEF6-980407966A1E Redacted Gross Description: A."Hepatic artery lymph node." A 2.0 cm lymph node is sectioned and no obvious metastatic nodules are identified. Half of the lymph node is processed for frozen section interpretation in 1 cassette, along with touch preps for rapid H and E interpretation.
