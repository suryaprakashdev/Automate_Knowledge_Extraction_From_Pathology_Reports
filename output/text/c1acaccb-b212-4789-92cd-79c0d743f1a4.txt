Jw 9/3/1 Type and grade (in situ): Lobular carcinoma in situ, nuclear grade 2. Primary tumor: pT3. Regional lymph nodes: pN1a. Distant metastasis: pMX. Pathologic stage: IIIA. Lymphovascular invasion: Present. Margin status: Negative (R0). COMmENT: The main tumor mass measures 57 mm in diameter. The tumor cells diffusely infiltrate a relatively discrete dense fibrous area in the central breast. A few smaller foci of invasive lobular carcinoma and LCIS are present in representative sections taken away from the main tumor mass, but the main tumor burden is in the central breast. The pathology findings were telephoned to Dr.  Pathology Consultation Report Page 1 Case #: This report continues... (FiNAL). Printed: Phoni

Right Breast total mastectomy. C. Sentinel lymph node;Right Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled right axillary sentinel lymph node #960 and is received in formalin. It consists of a 2.9 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm discoid lobulated portion of fatty tissue. On dissection a single 1.6 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. Iymph node is recovered. The node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette A1. B. The specimen is labeled right breast and is received without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy specimen which weighs 232 grams. A suture marks the tail of the breast. With this orientation, the specimen measures 12.5 cm from superior to inferior, 17 cm from medial to lateral and 2.5 cm from. superficial to deep. There is an overlying 15.5 x 7 cm ellipse of mottled tan to pale red skin. Mediaily and inferiorly within the skin is a 2.8 cm areola and a slightly retracted appearing 0.8 cm nipple. The skin is. bulging but otherwise unremarkable. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior. margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth fascial tissue is inked black. The breast is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a central firm and relatively well circumscribed area of fibrous breast parenchyma. This fibrous parenchyma overall measures 5.7 cm from medial to lateral, 2.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.7 cm from superficial to deep. The fibrous tissue is separated from the deep margin by a thin layer of movable fascial tissue. The fibrous breast parenchyma is 3 cm from the.

Datiant. Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT inferior margin, 3 cm from the superior margin, 4 cm from the medial margin, and 6 cm from the lateral margin. It is 1 cm from the closest skin and abuts the fascial margin of the posterior breast centrally.. Representative samples of this tissue are obtained for research purposes. Sections of this fibrous breast. tissue reveal a central and inferiorly located area of hemorrhage with a twisted biopsy site clip. The remainder of the breast is composed predominantly of fatty tissue but rubbery fibrous parenchyma extends to the lower-outer quadrant. There are no obvious lymph nodes in the tail of the breast. Representative sections are submitted.
