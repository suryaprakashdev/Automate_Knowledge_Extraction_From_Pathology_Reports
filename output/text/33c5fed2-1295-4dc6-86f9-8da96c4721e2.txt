1)  The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right Kidney".  It consists of a kidney with attached perinephric fat, weighing 510 grams and measuring 13 x 10 x 7.5 cm. A portion of ureter is identified measuring 6 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter.The. ureter is serially sectioned revealing a grossly unremarkable cut surface.. Vessels are identified on the hilum, ranging in size from. 0.5 to 0.7 cm in length with a diameter measuring 0.2 cm. The kidney is partially covered by a thick portion of perinephric fat which measures 15 x 6 x 0.7 cm. The kidney is bisected revealing a large, yellow-tan, focally hemorrhagic, partially necrotic, variegated tumor mass located predominantly on the upper two-thirds of the kidney, involving the renal cortex, medulla and pelvis, entirely measuring 10 x 9.5 x 9 cm.  The tumor appears grossly to be confined within the renal capsule. The tumor is serially sectioned, revealing a yellow-tan to red-gray, hemorrhagic and friable cut surface.  On the center of the tumor is a more. well-circumscribed, markedly hemorrhagic area measuring 4 x 4 x 2 cm.  A small portion of residual normal renal parenchyma is. identified. Photographs are taken.  Representative sections are submitted.  A section from the tumor is submitted for TPS and EM. Summary of Sections: UM - ureter margin RV - renal vessel PF - perinephric fat NK - normal kidney PEL -- pelvis T  tumor  AG -- additional perinephric fat HAT - hemorrhagic area of the tumor 2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Paracaval Lymph Node". It consists of multiple irregular fragments of yellow-tan, lobulated adipose tissue measuring in aggregate 5.5 x 3 x 2 cm. Twelve lymph nodes are identified, ranging in size from 0.3 to 1.7 cm.The entire lymph nodes are submitted.The two largest lymph nodes are bisected and placed in the first two. cassettes. Summary of Sections: PCN -- paracaval lymph nodes (2pcn2-bisected large lymph node and one smaller lymph node) 3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right Adrenal".  It consists of an adrenal gland with one edge closed by  multiple staples, entirely measuring 5.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm.The resection margin is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a well-circumscribed, tan-yellow, soft nodule measuring 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm.The rest of the adrenal gland appears. grossly unremarkable. The specimen is entirely submitted. Summary of Sections: ADG -- adrenal gland SM - stapled margin Summary of Sections: Part 1: SP: Right kidney (am) Block Sect.
