FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): Two lymph nodes are identified, both negative for malignancy. One lymph node is present in the breast parenchyma and is the nodule identified grossly near the inferior margin. The second one is the sentinel node in specimen "B". This case has undergone intradepartmental review and the above diagnosis has been agreed upon. ** Report Electronicallv Signed Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: year old white female with left breast cancer GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh labeled with patient's name "LEFT BREAST LONG STITCH LATERAL, DOUBLE STITCH DEEP, SHORT STITCH designated superioR" is a 230 gram irregular portion of breast tissue oriented as follows: short suture superior, long lateral and double deep. The specimen measures 1.0 cm medial to lateral, 10.5 cm superior to inferior, and 5.0 cm anterior to posterior and is inked as follows: superior blue, inferior green, lateral yellow, medial red, anterior orange,. posterior black. Serial sectioning reveals a 2.7 x 3.1 x 2.5 cm centrally located pink white firm gritty mass with well defined borders and comes closest to the anterior margin (1.0 cm). A second well circumscribed tan white fibrous mass is noted at the inferior margin measuring 1.1 x 0.9 x approximately 0.8 cm and comes to within approximately 0.4 cm of the inferior green margin and comes to within 0.2  cm of the lateral yellow margin. This mass is located approximately 1.2 cm from the larger mass. Remainder of cut surface is composed primarily of lobulated adipose tissue admixed with scant fibrous tissue. No additional lesions identified. Representative sections submitted as follows: Al: mass and adjacent normal A2: mass and adjacent normal A3: normal, 1.0 cm from mass Matched sections of A1-A3 and fresh/frozen tumor submitted for CBcp protocol. Additional sections A4- A5 inferior margin Page 2 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 Continued on Next Page.
