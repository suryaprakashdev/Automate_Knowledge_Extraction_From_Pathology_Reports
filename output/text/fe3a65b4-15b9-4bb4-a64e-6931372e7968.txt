1d/of1o bw 1Cs-0-3 Carciiomn, hnfi1t^ntmy duct, N0s 85oof3 c50.9 Sr+e Codi: brLugt, NOs B1961 Final Diagnosis Breast, left, wide local excision: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma with mucinous features, Nottingham grade III (of III), forming a mass (1.9 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm) [AJCC pT1c]. Ductal carcinoma in situ, high nuclear grade, comprises approximately 5-25% of the tumor volume and extends beyond the main mass. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative fibrocystic changes. The medial margin, after multiple (3) separately submitted re-excisions, is positive for ductal carcinoma in situ. Breast, left, simple mastectomy: Microscopic residual ductal carcinoma in situ is identified in the region of the prior biopsy site in the upper inner quadrant. No residual invasive neoplasm identified. The skin, nipple, and deep surgical margin are free of neoplasm.. Sentinel lymph node, left axillary, sentinel biopsy: A single left axillary sentinel lymph node with blue dye is negative for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN0 (i-) (sn)]. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression. Her-2/NEU has been ordered on paraffin-embedded tissue..
