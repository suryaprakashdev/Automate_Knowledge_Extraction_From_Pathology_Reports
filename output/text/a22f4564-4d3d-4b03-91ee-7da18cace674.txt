Page 3 of 4 Surgical Pathology Final Report Temporary Copy Case. Patient Collected: Ordered by Location Patient with large mass upper Central breast, core biopsy positive. PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Left mass and axillary node dissection Gross Description. The specimen is labeled "LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY NODES " and is received in formalin. It consist of mastectomy specimen with lymph nodes weighing 1330 grams and measuring 27 x 19 x 11 cm with brown skin ellipse measuring 24 x 13 cm, containing grossly unremarkable 1.8 cm in diameter nipple. The posterior margin is composed of smooth fascia which is inked black. Superior non-deep margin is inked with red ink and the inferior non-deep margin is inked with bhue ink. The breast is slices in sagittal planes revealing a large well. defined pink-tan lobulated mass measuring 9 x 7 x 6 cm and is located central portion of the breast and extending upper inner and lower inner quadrant. This mass is 1.5 cm away from the deep fascial margin of resection, 1.5 cm from the superior non-deep fascial margin and 2 cm from the inferior non-deep fascia margin of resection. The remaining portions reveal unremarkable yellow mammary fat with streaks of white-gray mammary parenchyma. The axillary fat pad measuring 10 x 10 x 5 cm. On sectioning multiple lymph nodes are identified. The Iargest lymph node is consists of a 2 matted lymph nodes measuring 4 x 3 x 3 cm and is pink tan and firm in consistency for 3.5 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 = nipple A2-A5 = mass A 6 -- mass closest deep fascial margin of resection. A7 -- representative sections upper outer quadrant A8 -- representative sections lower outer quadrant. A 9 -- mass with closest skin surface A 10 -- six lymph nodes A 11 = bisection of a single lymph node A 12 -- bisection of a single lymph node A 13 = bisection of a single lymph node A 14 -- bisection of a single lymph node A 15 = bisection of a single lymph node . A 16 = bisectionof a single lymph node A 17 -- bisection of a single lymph node A 18 - bisection of a single lymph node A 19-A 20 - representative sections of 2 matted lymph nodes. Specimen is in formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours Time specimen was removed from the patient: Time specimen was placed in formalin : Ischemic time: 45 minutes. Dictated by:.

Location Addendum Report IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVALUATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTORS, PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS, AND HER-2NEU IN INVASIVE MAMMARY CARCINOMA . ESTROGEN RECEPTORS: 99 %, positive, moderate staining intensity. PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: <1 %, negative, moderate staining intensity. HER-2NEU: SCORE I+, negative.  Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block A4) using the following monoclonal antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1), Progesterone receptor (Clone 1E2) and Her-2neu(  Clone 4B5); control sections for HER-2Neu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF-7, score 1+ T-47D, score 2+ MDA-MB-453, score 3+ BT-474). Detection system used: polymer. Primary antibodies, reagents and control sections for HER-2neu are all provided by All controls show appropriate reactivity. Reactivity of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors is determined based on the percentage of positively stained nuclei of tumor cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells. Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells. Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong.. HER-2neu reactivity is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Score 0 - Negative: No immunoreactivity, or faint weak immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive... Score 1 = Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive. Score 2+ = Equivocal: Weak to moderate complete membrane immunoreactivity in >10% of tumor cells or circumferential intense membrane staining in <30% of cells. Score 3+ -- Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform membrane staining. A homogeneous (chicken wire) pattern should be present.. Equivocal results for HER-2neu (Score 2+) will be subsequently followed by a reflex dual-color ISH testing. The performance characteristics of these antibodies were determined by the They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food. and Drug Administration.
