SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT PROCEDURE DATE:  SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Right colon. =- PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma, right colon.  POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same = CLINICAL INFORMATION: Same -= GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum, appendix and. ascending colon with attached mesocolon and omentum. Multiple adhesions are seen on the surface of the specimen. The terminal ileum measures. approximately 7.0 x 3.0 cm. The colonic and ceca1 segment measures 15.0 x 2.5. cm. An area of induration and puckering is evident on the anterior aspect just above what appears to be ileocecal valve. Opening the colon reveals a large fungating ulcerated mass measuring approximately 8.0 x 9.0 cm involving the full circumference of the colon. It has a central area of ulceration and raised irregular erythematous edges. The appendix is dilated and measures 4.0. x 1.0 cm MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections through the tumor demonstrate a variable pattern. In areas, it consists of atypical glandular structures formed by cells with irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei. Additionally. areas consist of poorly differentiated tumor. Here, the cells form solids nests and cords of spindle and polygonal shaped cells without gland formation. The tumor invades the muscularis from an ulcerated mucosal surface and extends into serosal tissues where it is surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction. Sections through sixteen lymph nodes disclose lymphoid hyperplasia and reactive changes, but no metastatic tumor. The resection margins are free of tumor as well. The serosal surfaces of the bowel and appendix demonstrate chronic inflammatory changes. #sFINALDIAGNOSIS: == ASCENDING COLON WITH CONTIGUOUS TERMINAL ILEUM, CECUM AND APPENDIX: ADENOCARCINOMA OF ASCENDING COLON MODERATE TO UNDIFFERENTIATED SIXTEEN REGIONAL LYMPH NODES FREE OF TUMOR TUMOR PERMEATES BOWEL WALL AND EXTENDS TO PERICOLIC ADIPOSE TISSUE
