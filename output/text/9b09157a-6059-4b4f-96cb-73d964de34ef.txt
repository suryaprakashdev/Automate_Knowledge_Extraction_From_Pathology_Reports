the upper pole of the kidney. The specimen is bivalve along the ureter to reveal a relatively circumscribed tumor mass at the upper pole of the kidney measuring 6.3 cm in greatest diameter. The remaining kidney tissue measures 10 x 6.2 x 4 cm. The mass shows mosaic colors of brown, tan and grey area. The texture of. the tumor is rubbery. No definite necrosis is identified. Focal scar is also present. The tumor appears to bulge and invades. into the renal capsule. The tumor does not involve the renal. cavity. No vascular involvement of the tumor is identified. The attached ureter measures approximately 7 cm in length and 0.4 to. 0.5 cm in diameter. The proximal ureter shows dilated appearance and contains urine. The rest of the renal parenchyma is. unremarkable. The cut section of the adrenal is unremarkable. Representat ive sections are submitted. A portion of tumor is. sent for and a small portion is kept in glutaraldehyde. No fat. Summary of Sections:. - tumor R - random section of kidney.
