Distant metastasis (pM):Not applicable Margins: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. Adrenal Gland: Not present Lymph-Vascular Invasion (excluding renal vein and its muscle containing segmental branches and inferior vena cava): *Not identified. Pathologic Findings in Nonneoplastic Kidney: None identified. Clinical: Right renal mass Gross:The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name and additionally labeled "right kidney." The specimen consists of a kidney with attached. perinephric adipose tissue that measures 14.5 x 10.5 x 5.5 cm with attached perinephirc fat that measures 13 x 9 x 1.5 cm.The specimen weighs 613 grams.A segment of ureter is present and measures 14 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. An adrenal gland is not present. The ureter is patent. The specimen is bivalved through the pelvic calyceal. system. A tumor that measures 11.5 x 9 x 9 cm is present in the upper pole of the kidney The cut surface of the tumor is solid. tan.brown and hemorrhagic.Tumor invasion into the perinephric adipose tissue and renal sinus is not identified. Invasion of the renal vein is not identified. No other lesions are noted within the renal parenchyma.The mucosa of the ureter and pelvis are unremarkable. The specimen is represented as follows: A=ureteral margin, B=vascular margin, C-D=representative sections of tumor with respect to kidney capsule, E-tumor with respect to pelvis, F-G=tumor with respect to unremarkable kidney.. H=representative sections of unremarkable kidney, I-K=representative sections of sinus,
