PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Breast cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,. designated "LEFT BReasT" is a 1.466 gram, left mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior, long lateral, and double deep. specimen measures 31.0 cm medial to lateral, 23.0 cm superior to inferior, The and 6.0 cm anterior to posterior. The darkly pigmented, superficial skin ellipse measures 30.0 x 6.0 cm, and displays a 1.0 cm everted, centrally located, nipple free of discharge. No scars are noted. The deep margin is remarkable for scattered, irregular portion of attached red-brown muscle measuring up to 4.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The deep margin is inked in black, and the superficial-lateral surface is inked blue. Serial sections reveal a 3.5 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm poorly defined mass in the mid-outer breast. On sectioning, the cut surface ranges from pink-white, and firm, to pink-white, soft, and cystic. Continuous, with, and deep to, this mass is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.9 cm smooth walled cyst containing serosanguineous fluid, consistent with the previous biopsy site. The cyst and mass are located 2.0 cm from the deep margin. remainder of the specimen is predominantly composed of lobulated, The yellow-tan, adipose tissue admixed with scant, fibrous tissue. No additional lesions are identified. Specimen subsequently placed in formalin for 32 hours. The attached axillary tail measures 13.0 x 9.0 x 3.0 cm. On sectioning, eight pink-tan, lymph nodes are identified which range in size from 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm to 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Representative sections are submitted. Cassette Summary: Al: Skin. A2: Mass. A3: Mass. A4: Mass and adjacent cyst.. A5: Normal adjacent to mass.. A6-A7: Deep margin closest to mass. A8: Upper outer quadrant. A9: Upper inner quadrant. Al0: Lower outer quadrant.
