PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS INQUIRY UUID:095AE671-9808-4895-B6FD-EDA3F7F9E69D TCGA-OR-A5JT-01A-PR Redacted PAGE#: SEX:F PAT TYPE: ADM DATE: OPER DATE: PROCEDURE: SPHS Operative Procedure/Tissue Submitted: Open adrenalectomy-left. PROCEDURE: SPGD 1. "Lett adrenal mass and spleen." Received in formalin in a large container is a 480 gm adrenal mass (11.5 x 10.0 x 8.5 cm) with attached capsular adipose tissue and spleen (160 gm; 11.8 x 7.5 x 2.0 cm). The mass is opened to reveal a tan-yellow, partially necrotic tumor (necrosis) predominantly in the inferior portion with a thickened capsule superiorly and numerous nodules that appear to traverse the capsule into adjacent fat. Inking as follows: superior blue, inferior green, posterior black, anterior yellow, medial red and lateral orange. Eight possible lymph nodes are identified (the largest 1.3 cm) in the periadrenal fat. The splenic vein is opened and appears to be free of tumor. Secticning of the mass reveals encroachment of the tumor onto periadrenal adipose at multiple margins.. 1A-H. Representative sections through capsule.. 11. Largest lymph node trisected. 1J. Seven possible lymph nodes.. 1K-Q. Representative sections through capsule. 1R. Representative section through spleen at hilun. 2. "Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection." Received in formalin in a small tall container are three fragments of fibroadipose tissue (in aggregate 4.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm). Eleven possible lymph nodes identified (0.5 to 1.8 cm). 2A. Seven possible lymph nodes. 28. Largest possible lymph node bisected.. 2c. Next largest lymph node bisected.. 2D. Ore possible lymph node bisected.. 2E. Ore possible lymph node bisected.. Fat retained. 3. "Diaphragm." Received in formalin in a small tall container are two, tan-gray, soft tissue fragments. Submitted whole in 1 cassette. 3A.
