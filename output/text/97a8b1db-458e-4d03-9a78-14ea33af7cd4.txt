Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Comment: Materials will be submitted to the. for microsatellite instability testing. These results will be issued in a separate report. Clinical History: with colon cancer. Gross Description: Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally labeled "right colon and omentum." It consists of a 2.9 cm long x 1.6 cm in circumference terminal ileum contiguous with a 26.8 cm long x 6.0 cm in. circumference large bowel with attached vermiform appendix (4.7 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter), omentum (13.9 x 4.7 x 1.3 cm), and pericolonic fat extending the length of the specimen up to 3.6 cm thick. There is a 3.4 x 2.7 x 0.7 cm firm gray/tan mass with raised borders that is 16.7 cm from the proximal margin and 8.1 cm from the distal margin. The mass extends 0.3 cm into the muscularis propria but not through it,. 0.6 cm from the serosa (inked black), and 5.4 cm from the mesenteric margin (inked red). Proximal to the mass by 7.7 cm is a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. submucosal fatty nodule that is 7.3 cm from the ileocecal valve. The appendix is. unremarkable. Also received in the same container is a 31.4 x 11.5 x 2.2 cm focally red/brown

segment of lobulated adipose tissue consistent with omental tissue. The pericolonic adipose tissue is dissected for lymph node candidates of which 21. are identified, ranging from 0.2 cm in greatest dimension up to. 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. The lymph nodes are firm and white. Tumor and normal are given to Block Summary: Al - proximal margin, en face A2 - distal margin, en face.
