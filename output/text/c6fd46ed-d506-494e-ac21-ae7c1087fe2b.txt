I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT ! HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Electronically Signed Out *** Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, anterior vaginal wall, bladder and perivesical lymph nodes". It consists of a cystectomy-hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen measuring 11 cm from superior to inferior, 12cm laterally and 5cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder measures 13 x 11cm, the uterus measures 5 x 4.6 x 2.8 cm, the right ovary measures 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm, the right fallopian tube measures 5.4 x 0.7 cm, the left ovary measures 2.7 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm, and the left fallopian tube measures 4 x 0.7 cm. The portion of vaginal cuff measures 5.5 x 2.0 cm. The distal urethral margin and the vaginal cuff margin are shaved and submitted. The ureteric stumps are buried in the specimen, measure approximately 2 cm and show probe-patent lumen. The specimen is inked black for posterior, blue for anterior and the bladder is opened anteriorly to reveal a friable fungating mass measuring 3.3 x 2.4 cm located in the dome focally extending to trigone. The  distance from the left and the right ureteric orifices are 5.2 cm and 5.3 cm respectively. On sectioning, the tumor extends to a depth Page 2 of 5

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT of 2.0 cm, and appears to extend into the perivesicai fat grossly reaching to the subserosa. The remaining bladder mucosa shows  flat mucosa without additional lesion. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are not identified. The uterus is bivalved to reveal multiple  fibroids ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 cm and endometrial polyp measuring 2 x 1.2 x 0.2 cm. The ovaries and fallopian tubes are  unremarkable. Tissue is submitted for Gross photograph is taken. Representative sections are submitted.. Summary of sections: UTHM - urethral margin RUM - right ureter margin LUM -left ureter margin L -lesion RUO -right ureteric orifice LUO -left ureteric orifice  LP-left posterior wall LA -left anterior wall RP-right posterior wall  RA -right anterior wall TRI -trigone EMM -endomyometrium CX-cervix V -- vagina, full thickness to include bladder mucosa. DVM -distal vaginal margin RTO -right tube and ovary LTO-left tube and ovary LN -- possibie lymph node 2). The specimen is received fresh , labeled "Right distal pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of 2 pink tan firm lymph nodes measuring 0.7 x 0.6 cm and 2.0 x 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The larger lymph node is inked black and bisected. All identified Iymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN -- lymph nodes 3). The specimen is received fresh labeled "Left pelvic lymph nodes".  It consists of muitiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 cm up to 3 x 1.8 cm. The lymph nodes are serially sectioned at 3 mm intervals and submitted.. Summary of sections: LN-lymph nodes BLN-bisected lymph node LN1-lymph node number one LN2-lymph node number two LN3-lymph node number three 4).The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Left distal pelvic lymph node" and consists of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 cm up to 3.5 x 1 cm in greatest dimension. All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections:  LN -- lymph nodes BLN-- bisected lymph node 5). The specimen is received in formalin labeled "Right distai ureter unclipped is a margin." It consists of a segment of ureter measuring 5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The attached adipose tissue measures up to 1.5 cm in thickness. There is a clip on one end of the specimen. The specimen is serially sectioned from the clipped to the non-clipped end and submitted entirely. Summary of sections: MC-margin with clip  SS-serial sections from clipped to non-clipped end.
