Gross Description: Received is one appropriately labeled container. Specimen A is received in a container additionally labeled "left kidney".. Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: radical nephrectomy, laparoscopic Side of specimen: left Size and weight of specimen: size = 15 x 10.5 x 7.8 cm; weight = 900 gm Presence/absence of adrenal gland: adrenal gland is absent. Tumor description/site: The tumor involves both upper and lower poles of the kidneys; the kidney also involves the cortex and medulla and appears to compress the renal pelvis; the tumor is tan in color; tumor is solid with small amounts of hemorrhage present; the center of the tumor appears necrotic. Tumor size: 11 x 9 x 7.5 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent; there is only one focus of tumor. Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: The tumor is confined to the kidney; this is supported by the fact that the tumor capsule is freely mobile and is slipping away from the bivalved surface.. Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: tumor does not grossly involve Gerota' s fascia: tumor does not grossly involve

Renal artery: negative Ureter: negative. Description of kidney away from tumor: The renal parenchyma in the lower pole of the kidney appears slightly hemorrhagic and congested without a distinct corticomedullary junction; the remaining renal parenchyma in the upper pole of the kidney appears more normal with a definable corticomedullary. junction. There is no evidence of cysts of hydronephrosis present.. Lymph nodes (hilar): none are identifiable Other significant findings: Tissue submitted for special investigations: none Digital photograph taken:. Block Summary: A1 - ureteral, arterial and venous margin A2 - tumor in relation to capsule. A3-A4 - representative sections of tumor, capsule, and normal renal parenchyma. A5-A10 - representative sections of tumor A11 - normal renal parenchyma Grossing Pathologist: , M.D.. Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr.. Histologic tumor type/subtype: renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe subtype.. CD117 foc pos, CD10 foc pos Dr. concurs.
