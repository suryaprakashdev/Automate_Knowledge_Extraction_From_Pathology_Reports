SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 SPECIMEN(S): A. RIGHT BREAST CANCER UUID:35F7D0D1-BA21-4135-8444-6B10EAF66F2S B. ADDITIONAL LATERAL MARGIN TCGA-E2-A1I3-01A-PR Redacted C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 E. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: Part A, Right breast, gross examination: Tumor is 1 cm from anterior/inferior/ medial margin TPC - TPE, Sentinel lymph nodes #1 - #3: Negative for carcinoma Diagnoses called to Dr. at. 1.(A) and . (C-E) by Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT BREAST CANCER Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated *right breast" is an oriented, 74-g, 7.6 x 6 x 4.3 cm needle localized lumpectomy specimen with two radiographs. The single suture designates anterior, double-lateral, triple-superior. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial- green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 6 slices, revealing a firm tan mass with granular cut surface, 2 x 1.2 x 1 cm, located 0.8 from the closest inferior margin. A clip is identified in slice 3. The remainder of the specimen shows areas of firm dense fibrous focally cystic parenchyma. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Submitted representatively: A1: Medial margin A2-A3: Mass and anterior, slice 2 A4-A5: Mass and medial, slice 2 A6-A7: Mass, inferior / anterior, slice 3 A8-A9: Inferior/posterior, slice 3 A10: Superior, slice 3 A11: Posterior, slice 3 A12: Mass, inferior/ anterior, slice 4 A13: Inferior/anterior, slice 5 A14: Inferior/posterior, slice 5 A15-A16: Lateral margin B. ADDITIONAL LATERAL MARGIN  Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's identification and designated *additional lateral margin" is an oriented (suture at final margin) 8-g, 4.1 x 4 x 0.5 cm fragment of fibroadipose tissue. The final margin inked black. Sectioning shows nodule measuring 0.5-cm. Submitted entirely: B1-B3: Serial sections B4: Nodule B5: Serial sections C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated *Sentinel lymph node #1" is a fragment of fibroadipose tissue, 3 x 2.3 x 1.1 cm showing one possible 2-cm lymph node. Touch preparation is performed. The lymph node is entirely submitted in cassette C1. D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "Sentinel lymph node #2" is a fragment of fibroadipose tissue, 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm, showing a possible 2.3-cm lymph node. Touch preparation is performed. The lymph node is entirely submitted, D1. E. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "Sentinel lymph node #3" is a fragment of fibroadipose tissue, 3.1 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm, showing a possible 1.5-cm lymph node. Touch preparation is performed. The lymph node is entirely submitted, E1. DIAGNOSIS: A. BREAST, RIGHT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:

C. LymPh NODE, SENTINEL #1, RiGht AXILLA, EXCiSiON: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1). D. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1). E. LYMPH NODE, SENTiNEL #3, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1). NOTE: The in situ and invasive tumors are negative for E-cadherin, compatible with lobular carcinoma phenotype. In part A., the main tumor mass is identified in slices #2 and 3. However, additiona!. scattered foci of invasive lobular carcinoma are identified in slices #4, 5, 6 and 7. Moreover, the. additional submitted lateral margin (part B.) shows invasive lobular carcinoma (0.6-cm). Therefore, this tumor is considered multifocal. Lobular carcinoma in situ is identified throughout the submitted sections. The closest surgical resection margin to invasive lobular carcinoma is the lateral (2.5 mm). LCIS is. identified at medial and within 1 mm from inferior and lateral surgical resection margins.
