Clinical Diagnosis & History: Core biopsy of left breast shows infiltrating carcinoma with FNA of node positive for carcinoma. Right mastectomy is prophylactic. Specimens Submitted: 1: sp: Right breast 2: sp: Left breast and axillary contents levels 1 and 2. 3: sp: Sentinel node #1 level'i right axilla 4: sp: Additional left breast upper flap tissue. ep DIAGNOSIS: 1) BREAST, RIGHT; PROPHYLACTIC MASTECTOMY: - BENIGN BREAST TISSUE WITH FLORID SCLEROSING ADENOSIS, FOCAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA WITHOUT ATYPIA, SECRETORY CHANGES, CYSTS, FISROADENCMATOID CHANGES AND A FEW MICROCALCIFICATIONS. - UNREMARKABLE NIPPLE. 2) BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1 AND 2, LEFT: MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY AND AXILLARY LYMPH NODE DISSECTION: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, HISTOLOGIC GRADE II-III/III, NUCLEAR GRADE III/III, ASSOCIATED WITH LYMPHOCYTIC INFILTRATE AND MEASURING 1.9 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION MICROSCOPICALLY. - A MINOR COMPONENT OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS). SOLID AND MICROPAPILLARY TYPES WITH HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE AND NECROSIS. IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH AND AWAY FROM THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA. - NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE NIPPLE, SKIN OR THE SURGICAL MARGINS BY CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.  LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. - THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE SHOWS PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES, FLORID SCLEROSING ADENOSIS, DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA WITHOUT ATYPIA AND A BENIGN INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA. E/098 - THE LYMPH NODE STATUS IS AS FOLLOWS (EXPRESSED AS THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE) LYMPH NODES IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LYMPH NODES EXAMINED): "erfe! LEVEL I: 0/8 LEVEL II: 1/7 THERE IS FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION OF CARCINOMA (>2 MM) AND PERINODAL VASCULAR INVASION. - RESULTS OF SPECIAL STAINS (ER, PR, HER-2/NEU) WILL BE REPORTED AS AN) ADDENDUM. ** Continued on rext page ** b'050 -0-401

FT  Fibroadipose tissue LIQ - Lower inner quadrant LOQ Lower outer quadrant urQ Upper inner quadrant OQ Upper outer quadrant 2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Left breast and axillary contents. levels 1 and 2 (2 specimen tags attached)". It consistn of a breast measuring 16 x 16 x 5.5 cm, with an axillary tail measuring 10 x 7 x 1.6 em. The axillary tail has 2 tags designating levels 1 and 2. The The is a centrally placed, everted nipple, measuring 1.o cm in diameter, surrounded by unremarxable areola, measuring 4 cm in diameter. Cross-sectioning of the specimen reveals a firm to hard, fairly circumscribed, centrally placed mass, measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm, approximately 1.0 cm from the deep margin. Ti is surrounded by dense fibrous tissue. The mass, arbitrarily designated cm anterior to T1 is a mass measuring 1.0 cm in diameter and approximately 4 Approximately 5 cm lateral and 3 cm from the deep margin. The second mass. which is arbitrarily designated T2, has a central cavity filled with necrotic material grossly. remainder of the breast tissue consists of unremarkable fibroadipose tissue. Examiaation of the axillary tail show several lymph nodes at levol 1. The ranging from 0.5 cm to 2.0 cm and at level 2 ranging from 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm. The smaller lymph nodos are submitted in toto.
