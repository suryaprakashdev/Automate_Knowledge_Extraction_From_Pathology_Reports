Received fresh labeled is a left eye measuring 22.0 mm superoinferiorly, 20.8 mm anteroposteriorly, and 23.8 mm horizontally. The globe is round in shape. An 8.9 mm length of optic nerve is present. The cornea is surgically absent. The thin rim of remaining cornea is transparent and measures 8.9 mm superoinferiorly, and 11.4 mm Page 2 of 3 Print Date:

Surgical Pathology Report (continued) horizontally. The sclera is smooth and glistening. Transillumination of the globe does reveal a shadow extending from 9:00 to 12:00. The globe is opened in a superior inferior meridian fashion to reveal a red-brown firm mass. The mass measures 8.1 mm in height and 11.5 mm in basal diameter. The mass does appear to grossly involve the choroid, ciliary body, iris, and retina. The sclera and optic nerve appear uninvolved. A lens is present. The specimen is totally submitted as follows: A1 superior calotte, A2 pupil optic nerve section, A3 inferior calotte, A4 optic nerve shave.  margin. w 1]30114 ual/Synchron s (circle: QUAL Page 3 of 3 END OF REPORT Print Date:
