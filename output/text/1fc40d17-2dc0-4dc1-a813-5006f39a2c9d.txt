Submitted for frozen section. The first is one fragment of rubbery, brown-tan tissue that measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette A1fs. The second is one fragment of brown-tan rubbery tissue, measuring 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto cassette A2FS. The third is one fragment of rubbery brown-tan tissue that measures 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette A3FS. The fourth is one fragment of rubbery brown-tan tissue that measures 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette A4FS. B. Received in formalin are two fragments of rubbery brown-tan tissue that measures 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Submitted in toto in cassette B1FS. c. Received in formalin is one fragment of rubbery brown-tan tissue that measures 2.9 x 2.9 x 0.3 cm. The tissue is submitted in toto in cassette C1FS. D. Received in formalin is one fragment of brown-tan tissue that measures 2.2 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette D1FS. E. Received in formalin is one fragment of tan-yellow tissue, measuring 2.5 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in cassette E1fs. F. Received in formalin is a 420 gram left partial mastectomy specimen (17.5 x 15.0 x 5.5 cm) with a white-tan skin ellipse (12.2 x 7.0 cm). The nipple measures 1.5 cm in diameter, the areola measures 3.5 cm in diameter. The specimen resection margins have previously being inked black. The specimen has been previously cut. There is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm irregular firm, grey-tan poorly circumscribed mass located centrally in the specimen posterior to the nipple. This mass lies within 4.0 cm of the deep resection margin, 0.8 cm of the superior resection margin, 5.5 cm of the lateral resection margin, 2.0 cm of the medial resection margin and 2.0 cm from the inferior resection margin. This mass appears to grossly invade the nipple and skin. The mass also appears to contain minute amounts of hemorrhage and necrosis. There is a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm irregular white smoothly lobulated mass with a rubbery, firm consistency located 1.5 cm from the lateral resection margin and 0.7 cm from the deep resection margin. No additional lesions are seen. The remainder of the breast parenchyma consists of grossly unremarkable adipose tissue with dense white fibrous stroma. Sections submitted as follows: Nipple 2&3 Superior margin with skin 4  Inferior margin with skin 5 Deep margin 6 Medial margin 7&8  Breast parenchyma adjacent to 4.5 cm mass  9-12 Composite section of 4.5 cm mass 13 Mass with necrosis 14-17 Additional sections of 4.5 cm mass 18 1.5 cm above described mass 19&20  Unremarkable breast tissue Page 5 of 6

The nipple measures 1.7 cm in diameter and the areola measures 5.0 cm in diameter. The surgical resection margins have been previously inked black. The specimen has been previously cut. There Is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm firm, grey-tan mass wlth areas of calcification and hemorrhage, located in the upper outer quadrant as well as the. Jower outer quadrant. This mass lies within 1 mm of the nearest resection margin. No additional lesions are seen. The remainder of the breast parenchyma is dense-white fibrous stroma with unremarkable adipose tissue. Sections submitted as follows: 1 Nipple 2 Skin 3 Lower outer quadrant 4 Upper outer quadrant 5  Lower inner quadrant 6  Upper inner quadrant 7 Deep margin 8-11 Mass with nearest resection margin 12-17 Representative sections of mass H. Received in formalin is a fragment of skin with attached adipose tissue, measuring 14.0 x 1.5 cm. The skin is tan-white. and rubbery. No lesions are grossly noted. The specimen is unoriented. Tissue submitted in toto in two cassettes H1- H7. i. Received in formalin is an unoriented portion of white-tan skin with attached adipose tissue, measuring 6.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm. No lesions are grossly appreciated. Submitted in toto in two cassettes A1-A13.. Page 6 ot 6
