UUID: 84C45214-ABFF-44F8-A315-04A8F646A57F Department of Pathology TCGA-P4-A5ED-01A-PR Redacted Tissue Source Site (TSS) #: Patient ID: Patholgy Accession No: Normal Sample ID: Pathology Report  DIAGNOSIS (A) LEFT KIDNEY: RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, PAPILLARY, TYPE 2, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (3.0 CM). (SEE COMMENT) TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. Ureteral and vascular margins free of tumor. COMMENT The tumor is a papillary renal cell carcinoma that exhibits extensive mucinous change appearing as basophilic intraluminal secretions on H & E. The Mayer's mucicarmine and Alcian blue stains are positive. The presence of an otherwise typical papillary renal cell carcinoma is an unusual finding. The tumor is negative for CD10. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT KiDNEY - A left nephrectomy specimen, (12.0 x 5.7 x 5.0 cm), with associated perinephric fat and an attached ureter. The ureter is 7.0 cm in length with a diameter of 0.3 cm. The ureter and hilar vessels are grossly unremarkable.. In the superior pole of kidney, adjacent to the pelvis within the cortex is an ovoid circumscribed mass, 3.0 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm. The mass has a friable pale yellow to tan homogenous cut surface, and focally abuts the renal capsule. The mass does not infiltrate beyond the renal capsule into the perinephric adipose tissue and does not grossly invade the renal sinus. No hilar lymph  nodes are identified, and no tumor is identified within the renal vessels. The renal parenchyma away from the tumor is unremarkable, with firm red-brown cortex, distinct cortico-medullary.  junctions, and unremarkable uretero-pelvic mucosa. A portion of the tumor is submitted to the Tumor Bank and a portion is placed in glutaraldehyde for possible further electron microscopic studies. SECTiON CODE: A1, ureter and vascular margins; A2, normal kidney parenchyma from the inferior pole, including renal papillae, cortex, and pelvis; A3, tumor and renal capsule; A4, A5, tumor and renal pelvis interface; A6, A7, representative sections of tumor; A8, tumor and surrounding kidney; A9, tumor and adjacent pelvis. CLINICAL HISTORY Left renal mass. SNOMED CODES T-71000, M-Y7343 "Some tests reported here may have been developed and performance characteristics determined by.
