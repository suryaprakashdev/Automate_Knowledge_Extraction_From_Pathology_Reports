TCGA-AL-3466 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Clinical History/Diagnosis: Right renal cancer, IVC thrombus. Source of Specimen(s): A: Lymph Node, inter aorta caval. B: Thrombus. C: Right kidney. D: Lymph Node, retro caval Gross Description: Received in four parts. Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1 "inter-aortocaval Iymph node" Gross Description: The specimen is received fresh and consists of a reddish-tan ovoid rubbery nodule measuring 3 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. Sections show tan homogeneous cut surface consistent with metastatic disease.. Representative sections in 1A. Designation of Sections: Summary of Sections: ************************************************************************ Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2 "thrombus". Gross Description: The specimen is received fresh and consists of a few fragments of tan to red friable tissue and some blood clot measuring collectively 4 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. It appears to be predominantly lesional tissue. Representative sections in 2A.. Designation of Sections: Summary of Sections: ************************************************************************ Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3 "right kidney'. Gross Description: The specimen is received fresh and consists of a right kidney weighing 640 gm and measuring 12 x 10 x 8 cm. A small amount of attached perinephric fat is present measuring up to 2 cm from point of attachment. No adrenal gland is found. At the hilum, a segment of ureter is present measuring 8 x 0.4 cm and is unremarkable. Also at the hilum, is a renal vein. The renal vein is markedly distended, ragged, and grossly contains tan friable lesional tissue. There is also an. appreciable amount of subcapsular hemorrhage posteriorly. The specimen is bivalved revealing a large white firm tumor measuring 8 x 6 x 6.7 cm. The tumor infiltrates throughout the kidney and grossly comprises

approximately 80% of the left kidney. The calyceal system is grossly involved by tunor and it comes to within 1 cm from the hilum. There is a small amount of somewhat normal appearing kidney with the usual cortical medullary rays. No additional lymph nodes are found. Photographs were taken. Fresh tissue procured for cytogenetic studies. Designation of Sections: 3A ureter and vascular margins, 3B additional. section of renal vein adjacent to margin, 3C tumor, 3D tumor in relationship to hilum/ureter, 3E tumor in relationship to capsule, 3F tumor in relationship to normal adjacent tissue and subcapsular. hemorrhage, 3G tumor in relationship to inferior calyx, 3H uninvolved left. kidney, 3I-3J perinephric fat. Summary of Sections: A-J. ************************************************************************ Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled #4 "retrocaval lymph node" Gross Description: The specimen is received fresh and consists of an ovoid. reddish-tan rubbery nodule measuring 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm. Sections show approximately 25% of the node to be necrotic. Elsewhere, tan cut surface consistent with metastatic disease is present. Representative sections submitted in 4A and 4B. Designation of Sections: Summary of Sections: Final Diagnosis: 1. Lymph node, inter-aortocaval (excision): - Metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma. 2. Thrombus, site not specified (excision): - Papillary renal cell carcinoma present.. 3. Right kidney (right nephrectomy):. - Renal cell carcinoma, papillary type,. - The tumor measurgs .8 cm in greatest diameter. - Tumor invades into renal vein and extends to the renal vein margin of. resection. - Tumor involves the lymphatics of the vascular margin. - Negative ureteral margin. 4. Lymph node, retrocaval (excision):. - Metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma. Note: The tumor shows extensive lymphatic invasion.

Procedures/Addenda Results-Comments CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS KARYOTYPE: karyotype with nonclonal abnormality: 46,XY[19]/38,X,-Y,?add(1) (p13),del(3)(p11.2),-4,-4,-6,-7,del(9)(p22),+?13,-14,-17,-18,-18,-19,-21, add(21)(p11.2),-22,+3mar[1] RESULTS: The renal tumor sample was sent to a commercial laboratory for cytogenetic analysis. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and analyzed, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding.. Nineteen cells had a modal chromosome number of 46, and the cells appeared to have a normal karyotype. One nonclonal cell contained nonrepetitive chromosomal changes that included a deletion in the short. arm of chromosome 3. This deletion has been reported in cases of nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma. Partial analysis of additional metaphases failed to. detect other aberrant cells.
