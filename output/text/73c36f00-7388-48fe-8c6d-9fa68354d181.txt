Diagnosed by Revlawad a nd alnctronlcaily signed out by:. COMMENT The Irnmunohistochemical stains on the first sentinel lymph node (specimen A) reveals seven positive cells with the Cytokeratin stain In the subcapsular space indlcating incidental microscopic micrometastases. The seven cells are in total measurements less than 0.1 mm. The second lymph node. (specimen B) is negative. No individua! positive cells seen.. GROSS DESCRIPTION The specimen is received In three separate containers labeled lesignated A, B, C.. A. The container Is recelved fresh unfixed labeled *left sentinel lymph node #1 for frozen section". The specimen consists of an ovoid mass of apparent fatty tissue which is 1 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. in.  greatest overall dimenslon. Sectioning reveals a pink-tan firm nodule varying up to 0.4 cm. in greatest dimension. Touch prep and frozen section are obtained by Dr. specirmen including frozen section is submitted in two blocks.. The entire B. The contalner is received fresh untixed labeled *ieft sentinel lymph node #2 for frozen sectlon" and consists of an ovoid mass of apparent fatty tissue which is 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is bisected reveallna a thin rim of pink-tan firm tissue. Frozen section and touch prep are. obtained by The entire specimen including frozen section is submitted in two blocks. C. The container is received fresh unfixed labeled "left breast -- suture on upper outer quadrant" and consists of an 953 gm. apparent left breast which Is 23 x 20 x 5 cm. in greatest overall dimension. There is an attached suture indicatlng upper outer quadrant which is inked with yellow dye. The Jower outer quadrant is inked with an orange dye. The upper inner quadrant is Inked with red dye, and the lower inner is inked with green dye. Seriai sectioning reveals a firm tan-gray tumor mass which is 6.5 x 4.5 x 3 cm. in greatest overall dimension and grossly appears to be 2 cm. from the underlying resection line, 5.5 cm. from the lower outer quadrant, 7 cm. from the upper inner, 8 cm. from the lower Inner and 8 cm. from the upper outer. The speclmen Is submitted in  nine blocks. Key Note Block Summary:. 1--nipp!e, 2 through 4-- tumor, 5-- deep resection line, 6---upper  Inner, 7---upper outer, 8--- lower inner, 9-- lower outer.
