The terminal ileum measures 9,0 cm in length and 4.5 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 18.5 cm in length with a circumference of 8.3 cm at the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measures 6.0 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagie lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 4.0 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a mass.  lesion in the cecum, 0.s cm distal to the ileocecal valve,. measuring 4.5 cm in length and 4.0 cm in width. Sectioning show that the tunor invades into the muscle wall. The depth of invasion is 0.5 cm grossly. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for iymph  node dissection. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached adipose tissue and.are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and tor Tps..
