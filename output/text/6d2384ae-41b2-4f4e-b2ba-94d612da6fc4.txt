Summary of Sections: FSC  - frozen section control 2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, "Left Kidney and Adrenal". It consists of a kidney, adrenal gland, an 8.2 cm long segment of ureter. The specimen measures 21.0 x 12.0 x 9.5 cm and weighs 950 grams. Bivalving reveals a large ill-defined tumor arising in the upper pole and measuring 13.5 x 8.0 x 7.8 cm with one satellite nodule situated 0.6 cm from the main mass, measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor is rimmed by golden, yellow-tan tissue with extensively hemorrhagic and centrally fibrotic. Adrenal gland does not appear to be grossly involved. Sectioning of the perinephric fat does not reveal gross extension of tumor through the renal capsule. The tumor extends to the upper peripheral portion of renal pelvis and renal vein does not appear to be grossly involved. Representative sections of tumor with surgical margin is submitted.
