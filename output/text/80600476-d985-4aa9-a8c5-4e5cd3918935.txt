Intraoperative Consultation Specimen A, frozen section diagnosis of "no malignancy seen" is rendered by Dr. Microscopic Description Sections (Afl) demonstrate benign breast tissue including multiple large ducts. Neither atypical epithelial hyperplasia nor malignancy is seen. Sections (B1-b1o) demonstrate breast parenchyma with benign fibrocystic disease, apocrine metaplasia and benign intraductal epithelial hyperplasia. There is a benign intramammary lymph node (B3). Neither atypical epithelial hyperplasia nor  malignancy is seen. Sections (Cl, C7, Cl0) demonstrate breast parenchyma with benign fibrocystic disease and benign intraductal epithelial hyperplasia.

HER-2 OVEREXPRESSION: Positive, 3+. Ki-67: Unfavorable (46%). Please see separate report for complete details of. analysis. Ki-67 proliferation index is reported as percent positive with less than or equal to 20% representing favorable prognosis category and greater than 20% representing unfavorable prognosis category. Her2 positivity requires greater than 30% of tumor cells showing complete membrane staining; score of 2+ is indeterminate (weak positive) and will be confirmed by Fish. A score of 3+ is strong positive. Only the strong positive (3+) Her2 shows strong concordance. with clinical trial results for Herceptin. Her2 scores of 0 and 1+ (faint incomplete staining) are considered negative. Criteria for ER/pR positive result: >1t of tumor cells with nuclear staining. Positive and negative controls react satisfactorily. Tissue is fixed in 10s formalin. Indirect biotin-free detection kit and high pH HieR are used.
