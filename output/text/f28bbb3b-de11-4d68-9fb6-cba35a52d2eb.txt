LcD-O3 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Case Number : Site BKudney N0S JCe49 NO 8/9/3 Diagnosis: Kidney, right, nephrectomy Histologic tumor type/subtype: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Sarcomatoid features: None identified Histologic grade (if applicable): Fuhrman grade 4. Tumor size (greatest dimension): 5.2 cm Tumor focality: Unifocal Extent of tumor invasion (if present specify if macroscopic or microscopic) : Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: Negative. Gerota' s fascia: Negative Renal sinus: Positive; microscopic (slide A9) Major veins (renal vein or segmental branches, Ivc): Negative Ureter: Negative Venous (large vessel): Negative. Lymphatic (small vessel): Negative. Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Gerota' s fascia (nephrectomy): Negative Renal vein (nephrectomy): Negative. UUID:96CB2C5D-A95D-42B0-B42C-3A3C26B6451F Ureter (nephrectomy): Negative.

Comment: The malignant cells have high grade nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm with large vacuolated cells identified adjacent to blood vessels. The malignant cells are immunoreactive for CK7 and E-cadherin but negative for cDl0. The staining pattern for cDil7 demonstrates background staining and is non- contributory. The morphology and immunophenotype are consistent with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma.. Clinical History: -year-old male with right renal mass. Gross Description: Specimen fixation: Received fresh and later placed in formalin. Type of specimen: Radical nephrectomy Side of specimen: Per requisition, right. Size and weight of specimen: The overall size of the specimen is 20.9 x 14.0 x 5.5 cm . The kidney measures 12.5 x 8.0 x 4.5 cm. The overall weight of the specimen is 450 grams. The weight of the kidney (formalin fixed and perinephric fat removed) is 230 grams. Orientation: N/A. The perinephric fat is inked blue at the time of triage. Presence/absence of adrenal gland: There is a 1.6 cm long staple line within the superior aspect and within the staple line there is a 0.4 cm in greatest dimension piece of yellow/orange tissue (may represent adrenal tissue). Tumor site: Mid pole, lateral Tumor description: The tumor has a tan/red soft solid well-circumscribed cut surface.. Tumor size: 5.2 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: Absent. Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: Confined Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: Does not involve.

Gerota' s fascia: Does not involve Renal vein: Does not involve (l.1 cm in diameter) Ureter: Does not involve (6 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter) Renal Sinus: Does not involve. Pelvicaliceal: Does not involve Adrenal: Does not involve. Other organs: N/A. Surgical margins:. Perirenal adipose tissue: Negative Renal vein: Negative Renal artery: Negative Ureter: Negative Description of kidney away from tumor: The remainder of the cortical tissue is red/brown, firm with a distinct cortical medullary junction. Hilar lymph nodes: No lymph nodes are palpated. Other significant findings: None Tissue submitted for special investigations: Yes. Tumor and normal are submitted to tissue procurement.
