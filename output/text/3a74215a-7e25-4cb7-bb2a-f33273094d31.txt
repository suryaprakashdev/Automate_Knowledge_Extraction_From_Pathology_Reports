SURGICALPATHOLOGY SPECIMEN A. KIDNEY - Left renal mass - margins - ? cancer CLINICAL INFORMATION Left kidney tumor GrOss DEscriptIOn -imen is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis labeled with the patient's name. Ieft renal mass" and consists of a 6.5 x 5.5 x 5 cm red-brown portion of partial nepnrector. urrace of the kidney overlying the tumor is inked in green. The entire normal kidney margin is inked in black. The estimated tumor size is 3 x 2 x 2 cm. The cut surface is not homogeneous with areas of dark brown tumor admixed with foci of lighter tan friable tumor. Representative sections are frozen as FSA1 and FSA2. The remainder of tissue. are submitted in cassettes (A1) and (A2). respectively. Representative sections submitted in cassette (A3)-(A9). SLIDE KEY: A1 -- remainder of tissue from FSA1. A2 - remainder of tissue from FSA2. A3-A6 -- sections with tumor A7 -- normal-appearing kidney A8-A9 -- additional sections of margins near tumor.. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Renal mass, left: "Deep and renal capsule margins within a few microns. Renal carcinoma, classification pending permanent section." MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Permanent sections show a variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with areas of solid proliferation without papillary structures. The lesion has a pseudocapsule, and it appears to be resected with approximately 0.4 mm distance between the tumor and the normal kidney resection plane. The papillary appearance is more pronounced at the periphery of the tumor. Nuclei are bland and are consistent with Fuhrman grade 1 without evidence of nucleoli. The cells in the solid areas have some kind of an eosinophilic matrix with occasional globoid bodies. Mitotic figures are rare, and in some areas, there is

the appearance of pseudorosette formation. The lesion contains some calcium. In slide A-6, there are good psammoma bodies represented. The nearby renal parenchyma appears to be normal. Vascular or Iymphatic invasion is not observed. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDIES: These are carried out to evaluate the solid areas of the tumor. The controls are appropriate, and the. following results are obtained: Synaptophysin -- negative. Chromogranin - negative. Keratin cocktail -- there is 1-2+ reactivity. CK7 - there is 1+ staining of the cytoplasm. Vimentin - there is good vimentin staining, about 2-3+. CD10 -- negative. COMMENT: We are dealing with an unusual variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with solid areas and presence of. Iow-grade nuclei indicating that this would fit a type 1 papillary carcinoma which is associated with a better survival rate than classic clear renal cell carcinomas. The lesion appears to be resected although it is close to the resection plane, at least focally. as reviewed the slide and concurs. A neuroendocrine component has been excluded. Surgical Pathology Cancer Case Summary, Kidney, Partial Nephrectomy SPECIMEN TYPE: Left partial nephrectomy. TUmOR SITE: Left kidney. TUMOR SIZE: 3 x 2 x 2 cm. MICROSCOPIC EXTENT OF TUMOR: Limited to the kidney. HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with solid areas. HISTOLOGIC GRADE: Grade 1, nuclei uniform and round with inconspicuous nucleoli. EXTENT OF INVASION: T1, tumor less than 7 cm. MARGINS: Uninvolved. BLOOD/LYMPHATIC INVASiON: Absent. ADRENAL GLANDS: Not applicable. REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: NX. DISTANT METASTASIS: MX. ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FiNDINGS: Presence of CK7 reactivity and negative CD10. Solid form of panillary renal cell carcinoma. Normal renal parenchyma adjacent to tumor. FINAL DIAGNOSIS LEFT KIDNEY, PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY - 3-cm papillary renal cell carcinoma, solid variant. - Nuclear grade 1.. - Type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma. - Margins free of tumor..
