Status post mammogram with calcifications in right UoQ and prominent tracer accumulation in both breasts on bone scan (Dhis). GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Right/breast biopsy". The specimen is a piece of breast tissue measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 4.0 cm with a 2.0 x 1.3 cm. tan well-lobulated well-circumscribed mass.  Blocks are submitted as follows: Block Al - Remnant of frozen section "AFi". Blocks A2 through A8 - Multiple sections of the biopsy comprising. nearly the entire specimen. B. and relatively small axillary tail. The anterior aspect of the breast is inked in black ink, and the posterior or deep aspect in blue ink. Overall, the specimen is 27.0 x 16.3 cm. with the breast measuring 19.5 x 16.3 cm. and. the axillary tail measuring 7.0 x 6.0 cm. in greatest dimensions.  The skin ellipse is 15.4 x 7.4 cm. with a 4.0 cm. semi-circular incision immediately superior to the nipple. This incision is sutured together with black suture material. On serial sectioning, the breast has a large white fibrous mass immediately deep to the nipple. In the anterior aspect of this mass is a 2.3 x 2.0 cm. biopsy cavity that is slightly hemorrhagic. The dense fibrous tissue is not grossly involved with the margins and extends laterally 6.0 cm. from the biopsy cavity. Examination of the axillary tail reveals seven lymph nodes in Region I, four lymph nodes in Region II, and five lymph nodes in Region III. Blocks are submitted as follows: Blocks B1 through B5 - Deep surgical margins from superior aspect. to inferior. Block B6 - Medial biopsy cavity. Block B7 - Additional surgical margin with grossly close surgical margins.. Block B8 and B9 - Lateral biopsy cavity. Blocks B10 and B1l - Inner upper quadrant. Blocks B12 and B13 - Inner lower quadrant. Blocks B14 and B15 - Upper outer quadrant. Blocks B16 and B17 - Lower outer quadrant. Block B18 - Section through biopsy scar. Block B19 - Section through nipple. Block B20 - Four lymph node candidates from Region I.. Block B21 - Three lymph node candidates from Region I,.  the largest being bisected and inked in blue ink.. Block B22 - Three lymph node candidates from Region II, the largest being bisected and inked in blue ink.. Block B23 - One lymph node candidate from Region II, bisected.. Block B24 - Four lymph node candidates from Region III. Block B25 - One lymph node candidate from Region III, bisected.. INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Frozen section diagnosis AFl: "Right breast biopsy - INFILTRATING CARCINOMA." MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:S Other changes seen in the breast include focal florid usual hyperplasia, interlobular fibrosis, papillary apocrine metaplasia, and cystically dilated. ducts.
