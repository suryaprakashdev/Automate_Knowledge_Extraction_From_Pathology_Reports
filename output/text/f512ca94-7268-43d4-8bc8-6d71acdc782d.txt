Pathology Report ***** MODIFIED REPORT - REVIEW ADDENDUM SECTION *** ADDENDUM COMMENT Immunoperoxidase study for keratin 7demonstrates that the tumor cells are positive. The results of the study are consistent with the diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. The supplemental report is being issued to report the results of an additional study performed after the original diagnosis was issued. There is no change in the diagnosis.. DIAGNOSIS (A) RIGHT KIDNEY: CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (3.0 CM). (SEE COMMENT) TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY Ureteral, vascular and soft tissue margins of resection free of. tumor. COMMENT Immunoperoxidase studies demonstrate that the tumor is positive for keratin and EMA and negative for CD10 . The results of the. immunoperoxidase studies support the diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. The stain for keratin 7 is pending. A supplemental report will follow. GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT KIDNEY - The specimen consists of a right kidney with perinephric adipose tissue (overall 12.0 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm), consisting of kidney (10.0 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm), and to the attached unremarkable ureter (2.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter).. A well-circumscribed tumor (3.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm) has a tan-brown homogeneous appearance without necrosis or hemorrhage. The tumor is in the middle of the kidney, closely abuts the perihilar adipose tissue. No gross invasion into the sinus adipose tissue is identified. The tumor is well confined in the renal parenchyma (0.7 cm away from the closest renal capsule). No hydronephrosis is identified. The remaining renal parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.. INK CODE: The perinephric adipose tissue surface close to the tumor is inked black. SECTION CODE: A1, ureter and renal wing margin, en face; A2-A5, tumor with adjacent pelvis and perihilar adipose tissue; A6-A8, tumor with adjacent renal parenchyma and perinephric adipose tissue; A9, tumor with adjacent renal parenchyma; A10, tumor alone; A11, renal parenchyma next to the tumor; A12, unremarkable renal parenchyma away from the tumor. Representative sections of the tumor are submitted to the tumor bank and the remainder of the tumor is entirely submitted for permanent section. 1
