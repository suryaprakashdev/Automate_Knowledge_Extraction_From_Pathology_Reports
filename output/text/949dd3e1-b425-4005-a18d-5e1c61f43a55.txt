Result type: Surgical Pathology Report 8s00fE Result date: Sits Result status: Signed Result title: Surgical Pathology Report Performed by: c sD 2 Verified by: g 75/3 Encounter info: * Final Report * Clinical History Right breast IDC at 12:00 position on prior core, ER+, PR+, HER2-. FNA of right axillary node was positive. UUID:A81EB5E0-305E-4657-94AD-0922CD1D79C60 Specimen TCGA-AC-A6NO-01A-PR Redacted #1 Right breast, stitch is lateral. #2 Right axillary contents. Gross Examination #1 Received fresh labeled right breast, stitch is lateral, is a lios gram, 21.5 x 20.0 x 6.5 cm simple mastectomy specimen,' oriented as stated above. There is a overlying 16.5 x 11.6 cm ellipse of brown skin with a normal appearing nipple and areola. There is no scarring or retraction on the skin surface. The deep margin is inked black and sectioning demonstrates a 17.5 x 12.0 cm ill-defined area of firm, gritty pink tan fibroglandular tissue, spanning all four quadrants. margin, (upper inner quadrant). within the gritty, nodular parenchyma there is a well circumscribed 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm white tan, indurated mass.  This mass is located subareolar, is 1.8 cm deep to the skin, 2.5 cm from the deep margin and at least 6 cm from all remaining margins. There are also four additional. smaller well circumscribed white tan, indurated masses, all within the upper inner quadrant. They range from 1.0-1.6 cm in greatest dimension. The closest smaller nodules in the upper inner quadrant is focally hemorrhagic One of the. (approximately 12:00-1:00 1ocation). The remainder of the tissue is composed of soft, lobulated adipose tissue intermixed with scant, delicate brands of fibrous tissue (sot and 20% respectively).  There are no apparent lymph nodes at the lateral pole and no. additional obvious masses are grossly seen. Fourteen sections are submitted in thirteen: "A-m". Block summary: "A", nipple and skin; "p", deep margin at closest approach to gritty nodular tissue (upper inner quadrant), perpendicular; subareolar mass; "g-h", four smaller masses in upper inner quadrant (one section per mass). focally hemorrhagic mass at 12:00-1:00 in "e":. aspect of gritty nodular tissue; "J", most lateral aspect of gritty nodular. "I", most medial Printed by: Printed on: Page 1 of 3 (Continued)

Within the node candidates are identified up to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension... The largest candidate there is a focal firm, 0.s cm area of discoloration. candidates are submitted as thirty-three sections in fifteen: "A-o.
