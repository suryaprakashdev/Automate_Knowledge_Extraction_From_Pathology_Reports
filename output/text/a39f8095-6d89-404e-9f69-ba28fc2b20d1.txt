FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974S ? SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued): TUMOR PRESENT <O.1 CM (O.9 MM) FROM THE DESIGNATED "NEW TRUE MARGIN" (C8), SEE COMMENT. D. BREAST, LEFT (ADDITIONAL DEEP MARGIN), EXCISION:) - BENIGN BREAST TISSUE - NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY. COMMENT : PART A. The tumor exhibits a lobular growth pattern, which is confirmed by an E-cadherin immunohistochemicai stain. However, focal tubular formation is noted in scattered portions of tumor. Based on morphologic and immunohistochemical features, the tumor type is interpreted as being infiltrative lobular carcinoma with focal ductal differentiation. Assessment of the greatest dimension of tumor size is hindered by the multifocal nature of the infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The greatest dimension of 2.3 cm is based on the combination of microscopic and. radiographic findings in this case. PART C. The tumor exhibits features that are similar to those features seen in the tumor in Part A. This case received intradepartmental consultation.. Previous biopsy material was reviewed in conjunction with this. case. ** Report Electronically Signed Out **.

TOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSOWAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 1 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: none provided GROSS DESCRIPTION: A: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name designated "Left Breast Lumpectomy" is a breast lumpectomy specimen with and accompanying radiograph, measuring 6.0 cm from superior to inferior, 3.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 2.0 cm from anterior to posterior. A 4.0 x 0.6 cm lightly pigmented, loosely adherent skin ellipse is noted on the superficial surface. The specimen is inked as follows: superior - blue; inferior - green; medial - red; lateral - yellow; anterior .  orange; posterior - black. Serial sectioning reveals a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm poorly defined mass. The cut surface is tan-white, firm and focally congested with an embedded metallic clip. The mass is located 0.5 cm from the anterior, medial, and posterior margins, and 0.7 cm from the lateral margin. The remainder of the specimen is composed of markedly dense tan-white fibrous tissue admixed with a minimal amount of adipose tissue. Entirely submitted. Cassette Summary: Al-anterior-lateral margin with skin A2-posterior-medial margin A3-posterior-lateral margin A4-posterior margin A5-mass A6-mass in relation to deep margin A7 through A16 - remaining serial sections from superior to inferior, with matched plane sections in A10-A11 and A12-A13. B: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name. designated "Sentinel Node #1" is a single 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm pink-tan and lymph node. The specimen is trisected and submitted in cassettes B1-B2. . A matched section of B1 is submitted in for cbcp protocol. C: Rereived in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, and designated "Additional Superior Margin" is an irregular. fragment of pale yellow adipose tissue measuring 5.2 x 2.9 x 1.0 cm in overall dimensions. Several metallic staples are present embedded on one surface of the specimen; this surface is designated as the new true. margin. This surface will be inked orange and the opposing surface will be inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a dense tan-white fibrous cut surface. Residual tumor is not grossly identified. The specimen is entirely and sequentially submitted in eight cassettes. 8cfns D: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, Page 3 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DEsCRIPTION (continued) : and designated "Additional Deep Margin" is an irregular fragment or tan-yellow lobulated adipose tissue measuring 2.3 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm in. overall dimensions. Several metallic staples are identified embedded in one surface of the specimen; this surface is identified as the true new margin. This surface is inked orange, and the opposing surface is inked. blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a homogeneous tan-yellow cut surface without evidence of residual tumor.  The specimen is entirely and sequentially submitted in three cassettes.. Page 4 End of Report FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
