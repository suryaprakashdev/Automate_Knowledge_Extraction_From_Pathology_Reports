LT BREAST AND AXILLARY TISSUES B. ADDITIONAL LYMPH NODES LT AXILLA GROSS DESCRIPTION PART A RECEIVED FRESH LABELEDS LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS SUTURE AT 12 O'CLOCK, AND CONSISTSS A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN WITH OVERALL DIMENSIONS OF 31 X 20.5 X 5.8 CM.  THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE AND SITS WITHIN A SKIN ELLIPSE MEASURING 21 X 12.3 CM. THERE IS A 3.5 CM IN LENGTH WELL-HEALED PERIAREOLAR SCAR EXTENDING FROM 12 TO 2 O'CLOCK. THERE IS A PALPABLE MASS IN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP ASPECT WITH BLACK INK.  THE AXILLARY TAIL IS REMOVED AND EXAMINED FORS LYMPH NODES, OF WHICH MULTIPLE ARE IDENTIFIED.S SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A4-~THREE NODES, EACH BISECTED; A5--THREE NODES, EACH BISECTED; A6--SECTION OF ONE NODE; A7--SECTION OF ONE NODE; A8--SECTION OF ONE NODE; A9--SECTION OF ONE NODE; A1O--SECTION OF ONE NODE. NOTE THAT A6 THROUGH A1O ARE MIRROR IMAGES OF PROTOCOL SECTIONS. A11--TWO NODES, EACH BISECTED.  SECTIONING THE BREAST REVEALS THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT TO BE A ROUNDED PINK-TAN SOFT MASS WHICH IS CENTRALLY CYSTIC.  IT MEASURES( 4 X 3.7 X 2.8 CM. GROSSLY, THIS ABUTS THE DEEP MARGIN.  IMMEDIATELY SUPERFICIAL TO THIS MASS IS A SECOND NODULE WITH A COIL CLIP MEASURING 1.5 X I.2 X 1.0 CM. MEDIAL AND CENTRAL TO THE BREAST, THE SPECIMEN HAS A TAN FIBROUS BAND WHICH EXTENDS 9 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR AND THERE IS TAN FIBROUS TISSUE CENTRAL WITHIN THE BREAST.  THIS IS SURROUNDED BY A PERIMETER OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A15 AND 16--MASS IN DEEP MARGIN; A17--SECTION OF THE MASS AND THE ADJACENT MORE SUPERFICIAL NODULE; A18, 19 AND 20--SECTIONS OF MASS CORRESPONDING TO SECTIONS FROM THE SUBMITTED PER PROTOCOL, WITH A20 REPRESENTING THE ADJACENT FIBROUS TISSUE; A21--AN ADDITIONAL SECTION OF THE SUPERFICIAL LESION (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL) ; A22--UPPER OUTERS QUADRANT; A23--UPPER INNER QUADRANT; A24--LOWER INNER QUADRANT;: A25--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT (A22 THROUGH A25 ARE MIRROR IMAGE SECTIONS TO PROTOCOL) ; A26--TISSUE FROM SUPERIOR PORTION OF BREAST. THE AXILLARY TAIL IS REEXAMINED FOR LYMPH NODES AFTER FIXATION TIME IN ACETIC FORMALIN. ADDITIONAL NODES ARE THEN SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS:
