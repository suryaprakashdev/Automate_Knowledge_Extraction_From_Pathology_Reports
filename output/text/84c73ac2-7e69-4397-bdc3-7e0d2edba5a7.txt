Invasion of Vascular/Lymphatic: Present Perinephric Tissue Invasion: Present Margins:  Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Adrenal Gland:  Uninvolved by tumor Regional Lymph Nodes: Positive 9 /11 Additional Findings: None identified. Pathological Staging (pTNM): pT 3a N 1 M X Pathological staging is based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT KIDNEY Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left kidney" is a 1036 g kidney with attached perinephric fat, 24 x 9 x 8.3 cm. The adrenal gland is golden-orange and measures1.4 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The ureter is 9.5 x 0.3 cm; it is probe patent and contains a green Teflon catheter. The specimen is inked black; it is bisected. The kidney is 19 x 7.8 x 5.5 cm. The renal pelvis is dilated and protruding from the calyx into the pelvis is a friable brown-tan hemorrhagic mass. The lower pole contains a friable,. papillary, hemorrhagic golden tan necrotic mass, 7.5 x 6.3 x 6.1 cm. The mass grossly extends into the renal pelvis and pushes on the capsule. The renal fat surrounding the mass is edematous. The soft tissue surrounding the dilated renal pelvis has a white-yellow discoloration. The remainder of the parenchyma is unremarkable. Photograph is taken and tissue is procured; representatively submitted:

LEFT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES Received without fixative in a container labeled with the patient's identification and designated "periaortic lymph nodes" are multiple fragments of fibroadipose tissue measuring 8.5 x 7.9 x 1.8 cm in aggregate. Sectioning shows multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 up to 3.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm.
