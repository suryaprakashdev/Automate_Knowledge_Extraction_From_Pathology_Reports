Tumor size (greatest dimension): 12 cm Tumor focality: Unifocal Extent of tumor invasion (if present specify if macroscopic or microscopic): Capsular invasion: Involved by tumor (microscopic). Perirenal adipose tissue: Not involved Gerota' s'fascia: Not involved Renal sinus: Involved by tumor (macroscopic) Major veins (renal vein or segmental branches, : Involved by tumor (macro and microscopic) Ureter: Involved by tumor (macro and microscopic) Venous (large vessel): Involved by tumor, extensive Lymphatic (small vessel): Involved by tumor Histologic assessment of surgical margins: Gerota' s fascia (nephrectomy): Negative for malignancy.

the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. B: Tumor thrombus, resection - Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 2. C: Right renal vein margin, biopsy - Positive for papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 2 Clinical History: with a left renal mass. year-old Gross Description: Received are three appropriately labeled containers. Container A: Specimen fixation: formalin Type of specimen: radical nephrectomy. Side of specimen: left Size and weight of specimen: 25 cm x 14 cm x 9 cm, 1,395 grams Orientation: The external perinephric fat is inked blue. Presence/absence of adrenal gland: present. Tumor site: involves the majority of the kidney (upper and lower poles, cortex and medulla) Tumor description: yellow, soft, hemorrhagic, multifocal, sharp borders Tumor size: 12 cm x 9 cm x 9 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent. Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: appears confined Extent of invasion: Perirenal adipose tissue: tumor does not grossly involve

Gerota' s fascia: not grossly involved. Renal vein: suspicious for involvement, grossly there is a large soft mass protruding through the lumen of the vein, clot versus tumor Ureter: suspicious for involvement. Renal Sinus: involved Pelvicaliceal: involved Adrenal: does not grossly involve Other organs: not present Surgical margins:s Perirenal adipose tissue: negative, widely free Renal vein: potentially involved, tumor approaches within 0.5 cm of margin. Renal artery: negative, tumor within 1 cm of margin Ureter: negative, tumor within 0.6 cm of margin Description of kidney away from tumor: tan, cystic in some areas Hilar lymph nodes: none identified. Other significant findings: There is a potential clot located in the renal vein (clot versus tumor).. Tissue submitted for special investigations: tumor Digital picture: not taken Block summary:. Al - renal vein with clot versus tumor (non-marginal) A2 - renal artery, renal vein, ureter margins, en face A3,A4 - ureter suspicious for tumor involvement (non-marginal) A5 - sections of renal capsule, suspicious for tumor (non- marginal) A6,A7 - tumor (non-marginal) A8 - tumor at pelvis
