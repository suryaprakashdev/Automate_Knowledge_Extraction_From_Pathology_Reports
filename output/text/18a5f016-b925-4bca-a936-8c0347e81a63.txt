*** Diagnosis / Diagnoses: *** 1.: Partial colectomy specimen with portions of the terminal ileum and an ulcerated colon carcinoma conforming to the histological type of a moderately differentiated colorectal carcinoma, located 50 cm aborally from Bauhin's valve and circularly occupying the colon wall over a length of 5.5 cm. Invasive spread of tumor within all layers of the intestinal wall and extending into the level of the mesocolic fatty tissue. Colon otherwise with three tubulovillous colonic mucosal adenomas, two of which exhibit mild epithelial dysplasia (synonym: low-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia), one with severe epithelial dysplasia (synonym: high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia). In the cecum and O.6 cm aboral to Bauhin's valve, a fresh, ulcerous mucosal defect - status following prior endoscopic removal of adenomas and with no further portions of the adenomas that were removed.. Oral and aboral resection margins and large omentum tumor-free. 54 mesocolic and mesenteric lymph nodes tumor-free with uncharacteristic reactive changes. Tumor stage thus: pT3 pN0 (0/54), L0, V0; G2. + pT? in cecum 2.: Gall bladder with moderate, barely florid, chronic cholecystitis, probably with cholecystolithiasis.
