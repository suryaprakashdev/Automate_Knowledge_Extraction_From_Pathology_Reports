FS2 (B) Ureter, left, biopsy: No tumor seen. FS3 (C) Bladder and prostate, cystoprostatectomy: High-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma. (Dr. Clinical History The patient is a  man with a malignant neoplasm of the bladder. He undergoes a radical cystoprostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Gross Description The specimen is received in nine parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.. Part A is received fresh and is additionally labeled *right ureter.* It consists of a single unoriented, irregular fragment of pink-tan, soft tissue, measuring 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis as FS1, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette A1. Part B is received fresh and is additionally labeled *left ureter." It consists of a single unoriented, irregular fragment of pink-tan, soft tissue, measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis as FS2, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette B1. Part C is received fresh and is additionally labeled *4 - bladder." It consists of a bladder with a small portion of prostate, weighing 259 gm and measuring 13.6 cm from superior to inferior, 12.1 cm from right to left, and 4.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder itself measures 6.3 cm from superior to inferior, 5.5 from right to left, and 5.5 from anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked as follows: green ink. anterior right, blue ink anterior left, and black ink posterior. The bladder is opened from the anterior.

aspect to reveal a fungating, tan-white tumor in the inferior left and right bladder wall; the tumor measures 4.2 cm from superior to inferior, 4.5 cm from right to left, and 1.8 cm from anterior to posterior. lt approaches the deep margin within O.5 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette C1: Remnant tissue from frozen section (FS3). Cassettes C2-C3: Tumor in relationship to its closest approximation to the inferior, black-inked margin (0.9 cm). Cassette C4: Junction with normal mucosa. Cassette C5: Right anterior. Cassette C6: Right wall. Cassette C7: Right anterior. Cassette C8: Left wall. Cassette C9: Trigone/inferior bladder with base of prostate. Cassette C10: Left wall with tumor approaching the inked margin within 0.3 cm grossly. Cassette C11: Right inferior. Cassette C12: Left seminal vesicle. Cassette C13: Right inferior edge, <1 mm from green-inked margin. Cassette C14: Right seminal vesicle.. Cassettes C15-C16: Candidate lymph nodes.. Part D is additionally labeled "peripelvic fat." lt consists of two unoriented, irregularly shaped fragments of tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue, measuring 2.2 x 1.3 x 0.3 cm and 2.1 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes D1 and D2. Part E is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "3) Left pelvic lymph node." It consists of an irregularly shaped, unoriented fibrofatty lymph node packet, measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes E1 through E4, with one bisected lymph node inked in blue in cassette El. Part F is received in formalin and is additionally labeled *right pelvic lymph node." It consists of multiple unoriented, irregularly shaped fragments of fibrofatty lymph node packet, measuring 3.2 x 3.6 x 2.1 cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes F1 through F4, with F1 representing a bisected, blue-inked lymph node.. Part G is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "urethra-inked end is distal." It consists of a segment of urethra, measuring 5.7 cm in length and with a diameter ranging between 1.1 cm and 1.5 cm, with blue ink at one end. The distal half is inked in blue, and the proximal half is inked in yellow. Representative sections from 1-cm intervals are submitted in cassettes G1 through G4 as follows: Cassette G1: Distal blue-inked margin.. Cassette G2: Representative sections from distal half. Cassette G3: Representative sections from proximal half. Cassette G4: Yellow-inked proximal resection edge. Part H is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "8) Final left ureter." lt consists of a single. unoriented, irregularly shaped fragment of ureter with attached fibrofatty tissue. The tan-white ureter measures 0.5 cm in diameter and 0.6 cm in length. The overall dimensions of the specimen with the attached fibrofatty tissue is 2.5 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is inked in blue, the ureter is bisected and is submitted in cassette H1, and the remainder of the tissue is entirely submitted in cassette H2. Part l is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "#9 final right ureter." lt consists of a single unoriented, irregularly shaped fragment of tan-white ureter, measuring 0.3 cm in diameter and 0.6 cm. The overall dimensions of the specimen with attached fibrofatty tissue is 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is inked in blue, sectioned, and entirely submitted in cassette l1. Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all pathology slides.
