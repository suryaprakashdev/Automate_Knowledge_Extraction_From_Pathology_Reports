RENAL BIOPSY RIGHT KIDNEY:  Benign fibromuscular tissue with focal inflammation. Na evidence of malignancy. FSC1. RIGHT RENAL MASS: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, inked margin is free of tumor. Comment: These gross and frozen section diagnoses/results were communicated to and acknowledged by have performed the intracperative consultations and issued the above  diagnoses. Gross Description A. Specimen A is labeled *skin lesion x3 right flank". The specimen is received fresh and consists of an unoriented, gray-tan, wrinkled ellipse of skin with attached subcutaneous tissue (4.5 x 1) excised to a depth of 1 cm. There are 3 lesions on the epithelium surface ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is marked with blue ink on one half and green ink on the opposite half. The remainder of the cut surface is grossly unremarkable. No tissue is submitted to Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Permanent representative sections are submitted as: A1: Both tips A2: Lesion Na. 1 largest A3: Lesion No. 2 A4: Lesion No. 3. B. The specimen is received fresh for OR consult, labeled *renal biopsy right kidney, frozen. section*. The specimen consists of a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm, soft, red-brown, irregular fragment of tissue which is entirely submitted as frozen section as FsB1. C. The specimen is received fresh for OR consult, labeled *right renal mass,frozen section margins and diagnosis". The specimen consists of a moderately firm, red-brown, irregular, renal mass which consists of normal renal parenchyma and adipose tissue measuring 6 x 5 x 4.5 cm in overall dimension. The surgical margin of resection is marked with black ink and the renal capsule with adipose tissue is inked biue. Sectioning reveals a soft to somewhat firm yellow-brown, necrotic, partially hemorrnagic mass (4 x 3.5 x 3.3 cm). The mass is located approximately 1.2 cm from the surgical margin of resection. Grossly, the mass does not appear to infiltrate the capsule. The remaining renal parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. Additional sectioning isolates what grossly appears to be a portion of the adrenat gland measuring 2 cm in its greatest dimension. No tissue is submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections are submitted as follows: FSC1: Frozen section of renal mass with inked parenchymal margin

Specimen D is labeled "right adrenal*. The specimen is received fresh and consists of a 14.1 gm, 7 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm, soft to somewhat firm yellow-tan tissue which is entirely marked with black ink.. Serial sections reveal a bright orange peripheral focus with a hemorrhagic center measuring 3.5 x 2 x. 1 cm. The remainder of the cut surface is grossly unremarkable. No tissue is submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Permanent representative sections are submitted as: D1-D3: Adrenal gland with a hemorrhagic center D4: Additional section of adrenal gland. Mv y3/l4 DISQUALIED?
