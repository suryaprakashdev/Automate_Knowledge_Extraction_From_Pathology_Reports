Entire report and diagnosis completed by *s. COMMENT Although the tumor has central sclerosis, this comprises less than 30% of the tumor (so the tumor does not qualify as the subtype ot invasive carcinomas with a "large central acellular zone"). Although tumor approached the anterior margin in the initial segmental mastectomy specimen, this tissue was re-excised and found to be tree of tumor, so tumor does not approach the final. surgical margins. Tumor is 5 mm from nearest deep margin. Tumor marker studies were reported previously (see GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) RIGHT SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY - An oriented segmental mastectomy specimen (5.5 x 5.1 x 3.3 cm). Nine slices are cut from superior to inferior, and a specimen radiograph is obtained. There is a well-circumcised tan-pink mass (1.8 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) located less than 0.1 cm from the anterior margin and 0.4 cm from the deep margin. On the medial side of the mass there is a fibrotic area measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 3.5 cm. The entire mass and entire fibrotic area is submitted. INK coDE: Green - interior; blue - superior; black - deep; yellow - superticial; red - medial and lateral. UUID:48CB0118-074A-424B-82D2-E8A2397CF02E Redacted TCGA-GM-A2DC-01A-PR
