THE TUMOR DOES NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE BLADDER. - VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. PERINEURIAL INVASION IS PRESENT. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.  THE NON-NEOPLASTIC MUCOSA SHOWS THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITY(IES) : CHRONIC CYSTITIS, FOREIGN BODY REACTION AND PROLIFERATIVE CYSTITIS (BRUNN'S NESTS, CYSTITIS CYSTICA,) CYSTITIS GLANDULARIS) .  THE PROSTATE SHOWS NODULAR HYPERPLASIA, AND HIGH GRADES PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN) WITH ASSOCIATED ATYPICAL SMALL ACINAR PROLIFERATION.  THE SEMINAL VESICLES ARE UNREMARKABLE - THE LYMPH NODE STATUS IS AS FOLLOWS (EXPRESSED AS THE) NUMBER OF METASTATIC NODES IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NODES EXAMINED) : FOUR NEGATIVE PERIVASCULAR LYMPH NODES (0/4). 2) VAS DEFERENS, LEFT; EXCISION: -NEGATIVE VAS DEFERENS.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Electronically Signed Out *** Gross Description: 1A) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Bladder, prostate, urethra, urachus, right pelvic lymph nodes, right perivesicle. lymph nodes". It consists of a bladder, measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm with attached prostate and urethra. The urethra measures 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm, showing a red-tan, hemorrhagic, edematous, mucosal surface. The posterior wall of the bladder is partially covered with pink-tan, smooth, shiny peritoneum, measuring 6.0 x. 5.0 cm. The superoanterior margin of the specimen is attached with yellow-tan, lobulated fibroadipose tissue, containing lymph nodes, measuring 9.0 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm. Right and left ureters are identified. The right ureter measures 3.4 cm in length and approximately 0.4 cm in diameter. The right ureter is probed, showing a pink-tan, smooth, shiny inner surface. The left ureter measures 3.6 cm in length and is dilated to approximately 0.9 cm in diameter. The left ureter is probe-patent and contains clear fluid. The surgical margin is entirely inked. The bladder is opened anteriorly, showing an irregular ulcerative, hemorrhagic, firm tumor mass which occupies the left bladder wall and one of the posterior wall includes a right and left orifice, trigone and proximal urethral areas. The tumor mass measures 4.7 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm, protruding through the left bladder wall and extending to paravesical fatty tissue. The prostate is separated from the bladder and will be processed later. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of Sections: - Urethral margin RU  - Right ureter LU - Left ureter Page 2 of 5

LLN - Left pelvic lymph node 1B) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Prostate and. seminal vesicles". It consists of a radical prostatectomy specimen which includes prostate, seminal vesicles, and portions of right and left vasa deferentia. The specimen weighs 25 grams. The prostate measures 3.5 cm from apex to base, 3.0 cm. transversely, and 2.8 cm from anterior to posterior. The right seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures 3.3 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm. The external surface of the prostate is smooth. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to base at approximately 3 mm intervals. The peripheral zone show(s) no abnormalities. The periurethral (transitional zone) shows no abnormalities. 100% of the prostatic tissue is. submitted. Summary of sections: RA - right apical margin LA - left apical margin BN - bladder neck margin RSV - right vas deferens and seminal vesicle LSV  - left vas deferens and seminal vesicle A-F - serial sections of prostate from apex to base. 2)  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left vas. deferens". It consists of two fragments of tubular rubbery tissue, partially surrounded by yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue, measuring 1.4 cm in length, 0.3 cm in diameter and 2.0 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of Sections: SM - Surgical margin RS - Representative sections 3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left iliac. lymph nodes". It consists of an irregular piece of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm which contains several lymph nodes. The specimen is submitted entirely..
