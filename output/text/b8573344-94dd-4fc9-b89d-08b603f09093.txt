FS1 (A) Sentinel lymph node #1. left axilla, biopsy: No carcinoma. Cytologic preparations and frozen section. FS2 (B) Sentinel lymph node #2, left axilla, biopsy: No carcinoma. Cytologic preparations and frozen section.  Clinical History The patient is a -year-old with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. This diagnosis was established by core biopsy at another institutinn --- That hinncy showed that the carcinoma is ER, PR, and HER-2-positive. Gross Description The specimen is received fresh in four parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Part A, labeled "; consists of a single soft irregular. red-yellow candidate lymph node measuring 2.7 x 1.8 x 1.3 cm. Extraneous fatty tissue is removed. The candidate lymph node is bisected. Touch and scrape preparations are made. The remaining lymph node is submitted for frozen section, and subsequently submitted in cassette A1. The unused fatty tissue is entirely submitted in cassette A2. Part B, labeled " nsists of a single soft irregular red-yellow candidate lymph noae measuring 1./ x 0.8 x 0./ cm. Extraneous fatty tissue is removed. The lymph node is bisected. Touch and scrape preparations are made. The remaining lymph node is submitted for frozen section diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in cassette B1. The unused fatty tissue is entirely submitted in cassette B2.. Part C, additionally labeled " " consists of a single fragment of yellow fibrofatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. One candidate lymph node is palpated within the fatty tissue. The Paee 2 nf 8

Surgical Pathology - Working Draft specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C1.. Part D, additionally labeled consists of a mastectomy specimen oriented with. a short suture superior and a .uuy suture iateral. The specimen measures 14.2 cm from superior to inferior, 14.5 cm from medial to lateral and 3 cm from anterior to posterior. On the anterior surface, there is a skin ellipse measuring 12.4 x 4.6 cm. Within the skin ellipse is a nipple/areola measuring 2 cm in diameter. A firm mass is palpated deep and medial to the nipple in the inner upper and lower quadrants. The specimen is inked for microscopic evaluation, with the anterior superior inked in blue, the anterior inferior inked in green and the posterior inked in black. The specimen is then sectioned into fifteen slices, numbered from medial to lateral. The nipple-areolar complex appears in slices 5-7.. Sectioning shows an irregular, lobulated, pink-tan mass measuring 3.5 cm; this is located in the inner Iower quadrant deep to the nipple, in slices 5-7. The cyst mass extends to within 0.7 cm of the deep. margin, 1.7 cm from the anterior superior margin, and 1.9 cm from the anterior inferior margin. The remainder of the breast parenchyma consists of yellow fatty tissue and is unremarkable. Cassettes are submitted as follows: Cassettes D1-D2: Nipple. Cassettes D3-D4: Mass, slice 5. Cassettes D5-D7: Mass, slice 6 (widest cross-section superior to inferior).. Cassette D8: Representative medial margin. Cassette D9: Representative latera! margin. Cassette D10: Representative unremarkable inner upper quadrant, slice 2. Cassette D11: Representative unremarkable inner upper quadrant, slice 4. Cassette D12: Representative unremarkable inner lower quadrant, slice 3. Cassette D13: Representative unremarkabte inner lower quadrant, slice 4. Cassette D14: Representative unremarkable outer upper quadrant, slice 9. Cassette D15: Representative unremarkable outer upper quadrant, slice 12. Cassette D16: Representative unremarkable outer lower quadrant, slice 10. Cassette D17: Representative unremarkable outer lower quadrant, slice 13. VPathology Resident. /Pathologist Signed: Fee Codes: Addenda Addendum. Date Ordered: Status: Signed Out Date Complete: By: Date Reported: Addendum Comment An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed on block D6. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is variable nuclear stalning (ranging from weak to strong) in ~20% of tumor cells. The test for progesterone receptors is negative. There is no nuclear staining in any of tumor cells. Internal positive control is present.. Result of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is positive for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. Page 3 of 8

Surgical Pathology -  Working Draft An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 3 on a scale of 0-3.. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of O or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore. submitted for FIsh testing. The results of the FisH test are issued dlrectly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expresslon of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the resuits of immunohistochemical and FisH testing, and almost always show. gene ampliflcation. Tho immunnnernxirdase stain(s) renorted above were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the. They have not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement.
