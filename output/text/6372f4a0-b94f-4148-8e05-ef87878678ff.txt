Ceeun @18.0 J q124/4 NOTE: Microsatellite instability is not detected in the carcinoma by immunohistochemistry; therefore, the likelihood that the carcinoma is due to sporadic or hereditary (i.e.: Lynch syndrome-associated) defective DNA mismatch repair is very low. However, immunohistochemistry may not detect rare polymorphisms or missense mutations in DNA mismatch repair proteins in up to 10% of cases. If strong clinical suspicion persists, additional testing is suggested.. Archived slides and paraffin blocks were reviewed for case block A10 containing normal tissue and carcinoma was selected for MSI analysis. Immmunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissuc with adequate positive and negative control sections, including internal positive control tissue. The performance characteristics of these antibodies were determined by the :. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA hase determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. Thcy should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical laboratory testing.

MRN: Sex/DOB: Patient: Female Surgical Pathology Report Collected Date/Time: Accession Number: Received Date/Time: Clinical Information PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Right colon neoplasm POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Hand assisted laparoscopic, right colectomy Gross Description The specimen is labeled "RIGHr COLON "and is received unfixed. It consists of terminal ileum measures 5 cm in length and 3.5 cm. in greatest circumference, colon measures 18 cm in Iength and 8 cm in greatest circumference, appendix measures 8.5 cm in length. and 0.7 cm in greatest diameter. The serosa is congested covered by mesocolonic fat measures 34 cm thickness. Upon opening, the. Iumen contains fecalith material. There is a friable, polypoid, centrally ulcerated pink-tan mass measuring 5.5 x 4.5 x 1.6 cm. The masses and the proximal colon, 2 cm from ileocecal valve, 7 cm from the proximal margin of resection and 11 cm from the distal. margin of resection. The mass invades the muscularis propria, approximately 3 cm from the radial margin. The colon mucosa is congested with a focal black discolored area surrounding the mass. The ileocecal valve is unremarkable The terminal ileum mucosa is congested with no lesions. There are few diverticulum with no gross evidence of perforation. The appendix serosa is congested. The. wall is intact. The lumen is narrow, contains fecalith material. There are 20 lymph nodes ranging from 0.4-1.2 cm in maximum dimensions. Representative sections are submitted, the entire mass is submitted.. Section Key: A1-proximal margin A2-distal margin A3-mass with deepest margin A4-A21 mass A22-black mucosa surrounding mass. A23-diverticulum A24-random sections of colon A25-random sections of terminal ileum and ileocecal valve.
