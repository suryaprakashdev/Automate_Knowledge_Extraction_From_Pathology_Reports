Curu.amr,1ohulw,N1s 8520/3 r^cF: bust Nos C5o 9 Patien 7 UUID:468892B9-82C8-4305-BCB9-805F6F5FC90A  Surg Path TCGA-B6-A0RQ-01A-PR 'Redacted CLINICAL HISTORY: Not provided. GROSS EXAMINATION: A."Right breast biopsy", fresh. The specimen is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm portion of yellow to grey-white soft tissue. According to the surgeon, the resection margins are not a concern, as a mastectomy is planned. The specimen is not inked. Cut surface shows an approximately 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm mass composed of firm white tissue with interspersed foci of adipose tissue. The mass extends to the operative margin over a wide area.. The specimen is otherwise composed. of unremarkable adipose tissue. A representative portion of the mass is submitted for frozen section..  Another representative portion is submitted for. hormone receptor analysis. BLOCK SUMMARY: Al frozen section remnant. A2-A4 further representative sections from the mass.. B."Breast tissue right side", fresh. The specimen is a 700 gram, 21 x 14 x 4 cm breast with an attached, approximately 9 x 9 x 1 to 2 cm portion of soft tissue in the axillary region. The breast includes a 17.5 x 10.5 cm elliptical portion of skin with a roughly centrally placed nipple and a 4.5 cm transverse incisional wound located superior, and slightly medial, to the nipple. The skin is uniformly smooth and tan-white, without erythema, induration or nodules. The nipple is likewise unremarkable. Cut surface reveals an approximately 6.0 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm cavity deep to the incisional wound. The biopsy cavity occupies the region immediately deep to the nipple and the adjacent upper inner quadrant. An approximately 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm mass is present alongside the biopsy cavity, involving tissue medial and deep to the biopsy cavity. The mass is composed of firm grey-white tissue which contains foci of yellow adipose tissue within it. The surgical resection margins are grossly free of the mass; toward the medial edge of the specimen, the mass extends to approximately 0.3 cm from the deep resection margin, with questionable extension to within 0.2 cm from the margin at this site. breast is otherwise composed of adipose tissue and grey-white glandular-  The appearing breast tissue, showing occasional firmer areas of white fibrous- appearing tissue, but no other discrete masses or nodules. Nine lymph nodes are identified in the lower portion of the axillary tissue, and nine lymph nodes are identified in the upper portion of the axillary tissue. The lymph nodes range up to 3.0 cm in greatest dimensions.. Some of the lymph nodes show replacement with adipose tissue, but they are otherwise grossly unremarkable. BLOCK SUMMARY: B1-2 deep resection margin at medial aspect of specimen (closest approach of the tumor to the margin). B3-4 medial resection margin. B5-6 representative sections of the mass, medial to the biopsy cavity.. B7 section from fibrous-appearing tissue, lateral to the biopsy cavity.. B8 representative sections from upper outer quadrant. B9 representative sections from upper inner quadrant. B10 representative sections from lower outer quadrant. Criteri B11 representative sections from lower inner quadrant.. B12 nipple. B13 representative portions of skin. B14-16 one lymph node in several parts , lower axillary region.. B17  one lymph node in three parts, lower axillary region.. B18 two lymph nodes, each bisected, lower axillary region; one lymph node is I of 2

inked. B19 four lymph nodes, each single, lower axillary region.. B20 one lymph node in several parts, lower axillary region. B21 several questionable lymph nodes, lower axillary region.. B22-23 one lymph node node in several parts, upper axillary region. B24  one lymph node in several parts, upper axillary region.. B25 two lymph nodes, each bisected, upper axillary region; one lymph node is inked blue, the other black. B26 four smaller lymph nodes, each single, upper axillary region. B27 highest axillary lymph node (marked with blue ink) and several other questionable lymph nodes, upper axillary region.. INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Afl: "Right breast biopsy": Carcinoma DIAGNOSIS: A. "RIGHT BREAST BIOPSY*: INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA. B. "BREAST TISSUE RIGHT SIDE": INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA WITH A FOCAL CARCINOMA IN SITU COMPONENT. TUMOR SIZE: APPROXIMATELY 7.0 X 3.5 X 2.5 CM. INVASIVE CARCINOMA EXTENDS TO WITHIN 1 MM OF THE DEEP RESECTION MARGIN AT THE MEDIAL ASPECT OF THE SPECIMEN. LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN-SITU IS PRESENT IN DUCTS APART FROM THE TUMOR MASS (BLOCK B1O). BENIGN PROLIFERATIVE CHANGES INCLUDING: APOCRINE METAPLASIA AND DUCT ECTASIA. FOURTEEN AXILLARY LYMPH NODES, NONE OF WHICH CONTAIN METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/14). Verified I, 2 of 2
