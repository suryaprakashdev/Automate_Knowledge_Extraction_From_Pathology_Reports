Following removal of the tumor, a small capsular defect was noted at the. superior aspect and this was felt to be iatrogenically induced. No tunor spillage resulted from this and the tumor was clearly covered by a glistening unremarkable capsule following removal. Therefore, please see revised template and diagnosis below. ADRENOCORTICAL CARCINOMA v3 Tumor size: 14.5 x 11 x 7.9 cm. Tunor Weight: 560 grams. Capsular Invasion: Present. Vascular Invasion: Present. Surgical Margins:  Negative. Necrosis: Present (20%). S Mitotic Rate:  51/50 high power field. Grade: High-grade. ICD-O-3 Lymph nodes status: 0/1. Extra-adrenal Extension: Present. Stage: pT4 NX MX PROCEDURE: APDX 2. Right adrenal gland and vena cava, resection: High-grade adrenocortical. carciroma (560 gram, 14.5 cm), completely excised. Extensive vascular invasion 1130/13 including venus invasion within periadrenal soft tissues. Please see template for details. 8370/3 1 and 3-5. Please see previous report for diagnosis which remains unchanged.
