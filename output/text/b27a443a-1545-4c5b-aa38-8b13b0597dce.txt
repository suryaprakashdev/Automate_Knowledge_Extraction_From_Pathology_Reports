Touch Prep Diagnosis: Negative. ADDENDA: Addendum FISH anaiysis using DNA probe for Her-2/neu gene showed that, the ratio of Her-2/neu signals to chromosome 17. centromere signals is 0.94 ( 2.0 ratio is considered amplified). Therefore, Her-2/neu gene is not amplifiod. Pathologst.  Report Electrotisl? ...Bv Patholo.
