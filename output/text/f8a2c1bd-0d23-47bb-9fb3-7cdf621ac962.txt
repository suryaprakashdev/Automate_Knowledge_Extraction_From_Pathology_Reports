SENTiNEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: A- right breast: 1.5-cm mass at 0.5 cm from posterior margin TPB/TPC- SLN #1, #2 right axilla: Negative for tumor. Diagnoses called by Dr. to Dr. at : .(A) and .(B, C). GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOC Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast needle loc" is a previously inked, oriented (single stitch-anterior, double-lateral, triple-anterior) 31 g. 3.5 x 3.1 x 3.1 cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange Specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into 8 slices revealing a 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm firm tan stellate mass that is closest to the posterior margin at 0.5 cm. Tissue is procured. Representatively submitted: A1: superior margin, perpendicular sections A2: slice 2, posterior medial A3: slice 3, anterior medial A4: slice 4, posterior lateral A5: slice 5, anterior lateral (mass, clip) A6: slice 5, posterior lateral (mass) A7: slice 5, mid anterior A8: slice 5, mid posterior A9: slice 5, medial A10: slice 6, anterior lateral (mass) A11: slice 6, posterior lateral A12: slice 7, anterior lateral A13: slice 7. posterior lateral A14: slice 7, anterior medial A15: slice 7, posterior medial A16: inferior margin, perpendicular sections. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "sentinel lymph node #1" is a 2 x 1 x 0.8 cm lymph node. Sectioned, touch preps are performed; lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette B1. C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "sentinel lymph node #2" is a 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm lymph node. Sectioned, touch preps are performed; lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette C1. DIAGNOSIS: A.

Absent Multifocality: No WHO CLASSIFICATION .Invasive.ductal.carcinoma, NOS 8500/3 Tumor size: 1.1cm Margins: Negative Distance from closest margin: 0.5cm deep Tubular Score: 3 Nuclear Grade: 2 Mitotic Score: 1 Modified Scarff Bloom Richardson Grade:. 2 Necrosis: Absent Vascular/Lymphatic Invasion: None identified Lobular neoplasia: None Lymph nodes: Sentinel lymph node Lymph node status Negative 0/2 DCIS present Margins uninvolved by DCIS DCIS Quantity: Estimate 10% DCIS Type: Solid DCIS Location:Associated with invasive tumor. Nuclear grade: Intermediate Necrosis: Absent ER/PR/HER2 Results ER: Pending PR: Pending HER2: Negative by IHC Performed on Case:  Pathological staging (pTN): pT 1c N 0  Pathological staging is based on the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right iateral breast 1.5-cm invasive breast cancer, posterior near fascia, fascia included with specimen. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  None given ADDENDUM: SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: A6 ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 PR: Positive Allred Score: 4 = Proportion Score 2 + Intensity Score 2. COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from O to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.  Immunohistochemietn ws oerformed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by Dakc following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the R/PR immunohistocnemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,  information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. ONCOTYPE DX BREAST CANCER ASSAY RESULTS: Recurrence Score: 22 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE: Patients with a recurrence score of: 22 in the clinical validation study had an average. rate of Distant Recurrence at 10 years of 14%
