Patient: Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT A. Kidney,Left renal mass B. Base of left renal mass Clinical Historv/Operative Dx:. Left renal mass Gross Description: A. Single specimen designated left renal mass -. Initially received in a fresh state for Oncogenotyping studies, is an ovoid and tobular portion of red-tan, soft tissue, 3.2 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm and 5 grams. The likely surgical margin is marked blue. The superficial surface is glistening with light pink-yellow changes, now marked orange. Sectioning demonstrates a well circumscribed, softened, partially degenerated, yellow-tan tumor mass, measuring 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm. The tumor mass abuts the deep surgical margin, and overlying renal capsule. The tumor partially abuts or approaches within 0.3 cm of the peripneral surgical margins. The specimen is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation, in a. sequential fashion in A1-A6.. B. Part B designated base of left renal mass. Received in formalin is a single discrete fragment of partially cauterized light pink and gray soft tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm. The fragment is submitted within a filter bag in 81. Microscopic Description:. A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. B. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. Intradepartmental consuttation: nas reviewed a representative slide of tumor and concurs. with the presence of a positive margin.
