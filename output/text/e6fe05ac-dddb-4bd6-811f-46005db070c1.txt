SENTINEL NODE #2 INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: A-WLE right breast: Mass (1.4 x 1.2 x 1 cm) is 0.8 cm from the closest inferior margin. TPB/TPC-sentinel lymph nodes #1 & #2 right axilla: Negative for tumor by touch prep. Diagnoses called by Dr. to Dr. at GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. WLE RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "WLE left breast needle localization" is a previously inked, oriented (single-anterior, double-lateral, triple-superior) 53-g, 4 x 3.4 x 2.5 cm needle Iocalized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral- red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. Specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 7 slices revealing a 1.4 x 1.2 x 1 cm firm, tan, stellate mass that is closest to the inferior margin at 0.8 cm. Tissue is procured; Representatively submitted: A1-A3: lateral margin, perpendicular sections A4: slice 2, anterior inferior A5: slice 3, anterior inferior A6: slice 3, mid inferior (mass) A7: slice 3, posterior inferior A8: slice 4, anterior inferior (mass) A9: slice 4, posterior inferior (mass) A10: slice 5, anterior superior A11: slice 5, posterior superior A12: slice 5, anterior inferior (mass) A13: slice 5, posterior inferior (mass) A14: slice 6, anterior inferior (mass) A15: slice 6, posterior inferior (mass) A16-A18: medial margin, perpendicular sections (muscle infiltrating the tissue) B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "sentinel lymph node #1 right axilla" is a 4 x 2.3 x 1.5 cm lymph node; sectioned, it has a yellow-tan cut surface. A touch prep is performed;. submitted entirely in cassettes B1-82. C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "sentinel lymph node #2" is a 3.4 x 3 x 0.4 cm lymph node; sectioned, it has a yellow-tan cut surface. Touch prep is performed; submitted entirely in cassettes C1-C3. DIAGNOSIS:E A. BREAST, RIGHT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2 WITH FOCAL NECROSIS, MEASURING 1.5-CM - 1NTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM TYPES WITH CENTRAL NECROSIS - SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR - BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS AND GRANULATION TISSUE - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT. B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1), MEASURING 1.0-MM (MICROMETASTASES) WITH NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION, SEE NOTE. C.
