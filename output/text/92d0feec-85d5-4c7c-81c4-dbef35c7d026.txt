Surgical Pathology Report. Gross Description: Specimen # 1 is received in formalin labeled perirenal fat and consist of a 8 x 8 x 1 cm fragment of adipose tissue partially surfaced by a glistening fascia. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal no gross lesions. Representative sections are submitted in blocks 1A to 1B. Specimen #2 labeled right renal mass is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and consists of 195 grams, 9.5 (L-M) x 7.0 (S-l) x 6 cm (A-P) partial nephrectomy specimen. The specimen is inked blue in the parenchymal margin and black on the perinephric adipose tissue and then serially sectioned to reveal a 6.5 x 6.5 x 3.5 cm tumor ant about 4 mm to the parenchymal margin and confined to the renal parenchyma. The tumor cut surface is variegated and necrotic (approximately 35% necrosis). A . Representative sections are submitted as follows: small amount of tumor is procured for 2A: Perirenal fat 2B-C: Tumor to parenchymal margin.. 2D-E: Tumor to perinephritic fat.. 2G-H: Tumor to adjacent kidney and representative tumor.
