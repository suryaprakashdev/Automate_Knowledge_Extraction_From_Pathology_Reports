Test performed at: The maximum tumor size from the gross description and all slides of the tumor is 1.8cm, The smaller measurement 0.5cm in the diagnosis refers to a partial tumor measurement from a representative slide of the tumor. The maximum tumor size 1.8cm is the total final measurement used for the cancer staging in this case.
