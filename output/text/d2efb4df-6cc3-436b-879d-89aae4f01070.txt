GROSS DESCRIPTION Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled "bladder tumor" is a 10.5 x 5.5 x 5 cm dusky tan-red to gray-brown mass of tissue. On sectioning, focal areas of soft papilliferous white-pink tissue in keeping with tumor are identified. A portion of the presumptive tumor is submitted for tissue procurement as requested. Received separately within the specimen container is a copious amount of red-brown clot. No anatomic structures are evident. Random representative sections focusing on the apparent tumor are submitted in eight blocks. Rs-8..  RR1-8 additional sections submitted to evaluate for the presence or absence of muscle invasion. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Microscopic examination reveals extensive high grade urothelial carcinoma with some clear cell differentiation. The tumor is extensively exophytic. Invasion of lamina propria is identified in tissue block 6 and RR3. Muscularis propria is present. And some foreign body giant cell reactions are identiifed in the muscularis propria sections. However, no diagnostic invasive tumor is identified in those sections of muscularis propria. The lack of orientation of the specimen precluded accurate margin evaluation. The exophytic friable nature of the tumor also precluded accurate margin evaluation.. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 5 DIAGNOSIS A.
