FOUR FIRM OVOID STRUCTURES ARE IDENTIFIED MEASURING FROM O.4 TO 1 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. THE LARGER.NODES ARE EACH SECTIONED AND GROSSLY POSITIVE.  ONE-HALF OF EACH OF THESE IS SUBMITTED ALONG WITH THE UNSECTIONED SMALLER NODE LABELED A. THE REMAINING NODAL TISSUE IS SUBMITTED PER CLINICAL BREAST CARE PROJECT RESEARCH PROTOCOL LABELED P1-P3. PART B  RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT AXILLARY LEVEL 3 LYMPH NODE IS A FIRM O.8 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION NODULE AND AN IRREGULARS PORTION OF NODULAR YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 6 X 1.5 X 0.7 CM. FIVE FIRM OVOID STRUCTURES ARE IDENTIFIED IN THIS PORTION OF FATTY TISSUE. THREE OF THE NODULES ARE SUBMITTED UNSECTIONED LABELED B1.

THE ANTERIOR ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP MARGIN WITH BLACK. SECTIONING REVEALS THE CENTRAL 5O% OF THE SPECIMEN TO CONSIST OF DENSE TAN FIBROUS TISSUE. THIS IS SURROUNDED BY A PERIMETER OF YELLOW FATTY TISSUE.  NO MASSES ARE . IDENTIFIED....REPRESENTATIVE . SECTIONS. ARE SUBMITTED AS. FOLLOWS: C1--NIPPLE, C2--CENTRAL DEEP MARGIN, C3 AND 4--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, CS AND 6--UPPER INNER QUADRANT, C7 AND 8--LOWER INNER QUADRANT, C9 AND 1O---LOWER OUTER QUADRANT. ADDITIONALLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER AND INCLUDED THE WEIGHT ARE ADDITIONAL MULTIPLE IRREGULAR FRAGMENTS OF YELLOW-RED FATTY TISSUE IN AGGREGATE MEASURING 10 X 10 X 2.3 CM. SECTIONING REVEALS BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE AND REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED LABELED C11 THROUGH 13. NOTE:  MIRROR IMAGE SECTIONS OF THE NIPPLE ARE SUBMITTED AS P1S AND MIRROR IMAGE SECTIONS TO C3, C5, C7, AND C9 ARE SUBMITTED FROZEN IN OCT PER CLINICAL BREAST CARE PROJECT RESEARCH PROTOCOL. PART D RECEIVED LABELED RIGHT MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK IS A 146O GRAM RIGHT MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY. THE MASTECTOMY PORTION MEASURES 24.S CM FROM MEDIAL TO LATERAL, 26 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, AND UP TO 6.5 CM FROM ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR. THE AXILLARY PORTION MEASURES 10 X 9 X 2.5 CM. THE THE DEEP IS MARKED BLACK.  THE NIPPLE ANTERIOR MARGIN IS MARKED BLUE. IS UNREMARKABLE AND SITS IN THE MORE SUPERIOR PORTION OF THE SKIN ELLIPSE. THE SKIN ELLIPSE MEASURES 14 X 5.5 CM.  THE 12 O'CLOCK SUTURE IS JUST TO THE MEDIAL SIDE OF THE AREOIA. THE AXILLARY TAIL IS REMOVED AND RED INK IS PLACED IN THIS AREA TO INDICATE THAT IT IS NOT TRUE MARGIN.  UPON A QUICK PALPATION OF THE AXILLARY TAIL THREE ARE 3S PROMINENT STRUCTURES. THE 1ST IS A O.8 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION LYMPH NODE WHICH IS GROSSLY NEGATIVE AND IS SUBMITTED BISECTED AS D1. THE 2ND IS A 2.S CM GROSSLY NEGATIVE NODAL STRUCTURE SUBMITTED BISECTED AS D2. THE 3RD STRUCTURE IS A 3.8 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION GROSSLY POSITIVE LYMPH NODE OF WHICH ONE FULL CROSS SECTION IS SUBMITTED IN D3 AND 4. A COIL CLIP IS IDENTIFIED AND THE AREA OF THE CLIP IS SUBMITTED IN D5. THIS IS THE SAME NODE AS D3 AND 4. PORTIONS OF THIS LARGEST NODE ARE ALSO SUBMITTED IN P5 AND 6.  SECTIONING REVEALS THE CENTRAL PORTION OFS THE BREAST TO CONSIST OF DENSE TAN FIBROUS TISSUE AND THIS EXTENDS TO AN ILL-DEFINED GRAY-TAN MASS AT 9 O'CLOCK WHICH MEASURES 5.5 CM FROM MEDIAL TO LATERAL, 8 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR BY PALPATION, AND 4.5 CM FROM ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR. GROSSLY IT IS 1 CM FROM BOTH THE ANTERIOR AND DEEP MARGIN.
