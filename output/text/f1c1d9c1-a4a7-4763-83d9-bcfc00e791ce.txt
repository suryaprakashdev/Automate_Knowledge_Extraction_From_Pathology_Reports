TERMINAL ILEUM AND RIGHT COLON, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY: - MODERATELY TO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF CECUM, TUMOR SIZE 4.5 x 3.2 CM, INVADING INTO SUPERFICIAL MUSCULARIS PROPRIA. - SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.  SIXTEEN (16) PERICOLIC LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/16). - TWO (2) HYPERPLASTIC POLYPS IN COLON. - VERMIFORM APPENDIX, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. - SEE TEMPLATE. COLORECTAL CANCER TEMPLATE Specimen Type:  Right hemicolectomy Tumor Site: Cecum Tumor Configuration: Exophytic (polypoid) Tumor Size: 4.5 x 3.2 x 1.0 cm Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma Histologic Grade: Moderately differentiated to poorly differentiated Extent of Invasion: Superficial muscularis propria. Margins:  Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Absent. Perineural Invasion: Absent Additional Pathologic Findings: Hyperplastic polyps Extent of Resection: Ro: Complete resection with grossly and microscopically negative margins Lymph Nodes: Negative (0/16) Implants: Absent Pathologic Stage: pT2 N0 Mx SPECIMEN(S): A. TERMINAL ILEUM AND RIGHT COLON CLINICAL HISTORY:  None given INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: FSA: Colon and ileum, resection: Tumor at 9cm from proximal margin. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. TERMINAL ILEUM RIGHT COLON Received fresh labeled as "terminal ileum right colon" is a 28cm in length right colon and terminal ileum.. The specimen is opened to reveal a tumor mass at the cecum measuring 4.5x3.2x1.0cm. The mass is. sessile/ polypoid and raised. The mass is 1.5cm from the cecal valve and is 9 cm from the closest surgical resection margin. The serosa is inked blue corresponding to the lesion. The mass is sectioned. and does not appear to go through the mucosa. There are two other tan polypoid lesions noted on the mucosal surface measuring 0.9 and 1.3 cm. in greatest dimension. There is an attached appendix. measuring 10x1cm. The appendix is serially sectioned and reveals fecal material in the tip. Representative sections are submitted in 12 cassettes as follows: A1-A2: margins A3-A5: tumor A6: 2 presumed polyps A7-A8: representative sections of normal bowel A9: appendix with the proximal portion notched A10: 7 lymph nodes A11: 6 lymph nodes in toto.

A12: 3 lymph nodes in toto, 1 bisected lymph node A13: representative section of ileocecal valve A14-A16: other sections of tumor mass 90% of the tumor is submitted.
