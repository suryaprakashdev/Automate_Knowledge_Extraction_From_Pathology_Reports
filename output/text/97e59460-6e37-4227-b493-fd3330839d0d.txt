(13.0 x 8.0 x 5.8 cm), ureter (10.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), renal vein (0.6 cm in length x 1.3 cm in diameter), renal arteries (1.4 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter and 2.2 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), and abundant perinephric fat. An adrenal gland is not identified. A small portion of red/tan probable Gerota's fascia (6.2 x 3.7 x 0.1 cm) is present along the anterior aspect. The specimen is inked black along the deep margin and bivalved. There 3.0 cm) along the posterior aspect of the mid to upper pole, abutting the renal. capsule, coming to within 0.8 cm of the deep margin, 2.5 cm from artery #2, 3.2 cm from artery #1, 3.8 cm from the renal vein margin, 13.5 cm from the ureteral. margin, and does not grossly appear to extend in the perinephric fat. The renal vein is grossly unremarkable. Representative tumor is submitted to Cytogenetics, Electron Microscopy, and Tissue Bank for special studies. Representative normal cortex is submitted to the Tissue Bank and Electron encapsulated, golden yellow/red mass (1.0 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm) in the renal cortex, abutting and distending the anterior renal capsule, coming to within 0.5 cm of the black-inked deep margin, 14 cm from the ureteral margin, 5.5 cm from renal artery margin #1, 7.2 cm from renal artery #2, and 5.3 cm from the renal vein margin. There is a small < 0.2 cm nodule in the cortex. The medullary pyramids are diffusely hyperemic at the periphery and the corticomedullary junction is distinct. The pelvis displays an unremarkable tan urothelium. No lymph nodes identified within the hilum.

RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY : IMMUNE COMPLEX MEDIATED GLOMERULONEPHRITIS, PREDOMINANTLY WITH SUBEPITHELIAL AND INTRAMEMBRANOUS DEPOSITS, MOST SUGGESTIVE OF A MEMBRANOUS PATTERN OF GLOMERULAR INJURY (SEE NOTE) MODERATE CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (18 % OF GLOMERULI); - MILD TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS (IO% OF THE) PARENCHYMA); - ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE (SEE NOTE)S NOTE : The immunofluorescence and electron microscopic evaluation of the tissue suggests an immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis. Electron microscopic evaluation shows that the majority of the deposits are subepithelial and intramembranous in location. This pattern of injury suggests a membranous nephropathy, currently probably not very active. A systemic autoimmune disease (SLE) or a remote post-infectious glomerulonephritis cannot be 'ruled out with absolute certainty..

Pathorogy Repor Kidney Pathologist, performed the evaluation and interpretation of this material. DESCRIPTION: formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block Al1) were evaluated Sections Of using HE, PAs, Jones silver methenamine, and AFog (trichrome) stains; an HE-stained'frozen section and semithin submitted for light microscopy. The sample consists of renal cortex and medulla.  There are up to 173 glomeruli present in the sample. Thirty- two (32) glomeruli are globally obsolescent (sclerosed).  The preserved glomeruli show a mild increase in mesangial matrix as seen on the PAs stain. The peripheral capillary walls reveal thick basement membranes, with fine "spike"-like projections and many "craters". These changes are best visible on the Jones' silver methenamine stain. Tubules show normal. cellular details. distal tubules.  Focal tubular atrophy is seen in areas of interstitial fibrosis. Significant interstitial~inflammation is not evident in the sample examined.  Approximately 10 % of the tissue included in this biopsy shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, (AFOG).  Arteries show moderate sclerosis of the media, with focal replacement of smooth muscle cells by connective tissue. Arterioles reveal moderate. subintimal hyaline accumulation toluidine blue-stained sections were also. evaluated by light microscopy. IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY REPORT Sections of frozen tissue were incubated with antibodies specific for the heavy. chains of IgG, IgA, and Igm, kappa and lambda light chains, c3, C1q, albumin,

and fibrin-related antigens. The sample consists of kidney cortex and. medulla.. There are four (4) granuiar deposition of IgM (trace), Igc (+/4+) and fibrinogen (+/4+) in the mesangial areas and along the peripheral capillary walls. There is also diffuse linear deposition of albumin (+/4+) along all basement membranes.. Tubules contain reabsorbed proteins (albumin, IgG, c3) in the form of cytoplasmic granules. Tubular basement membranes reveal focal deposition of c3 (trace). Few casts in distal tubules are reactive for polyclonal IgA. The interstitium reveals scattered fibrin deposits. There is no difference noted in the intensity of the staining for kappa and lambda light chains in the casts, in the deposits, or in the background of the tissue ELECTRON MICROSCOPY REPORT Blocks: 4; Blocks examined: sections; 1 thin section. The tissue examined at the ultrastructural level includes five (5) glomeruli. The glomerular capillary walls are greatly distorted by the presence of. thickening of the basement membranes. Individual deposits are often surrounded by basement membrane material and "spikes".  The electron dense deposits are finely granular but they do not show organized substructures. There is. widespread microvillous degeneration of the epithelial cell membrane. Several epithelial cells also show prominent vacuoles and increased numbers of lysosomes. Glomerular endothelial cells appear unremarkable and do not contain tubuloreticular structures. Subendotheliai electron dense deposits are not seen. The mesangium shows normal cell elements and an extracellular matrix with few irregular electron dense deposits.

Accession Number: Report Status: Final Type: Cytogenetics CASE:  PATIENT: SS Cytogeneticist. KARYOTYPE : T1: 45,XY,-8[10] T2: 45,XY,-8[10] METAPHASES COUNTED:20 ANALYZED: 10 SCORED: 10 BANDING: GTG INTERPRETATION : Two different specimens were received from this tumor. Loss of one chromosome 8, as the sole chromosome abnormality, was seen in both specimens. This aberration is not known to be characteristic of any particular type of tumor. COMMENTS : Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400 bands or greater.
