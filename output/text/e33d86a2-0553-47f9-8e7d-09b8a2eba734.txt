2 LYMPH NODE, LEVEL ONE, RIGHT AXILLA, ADDITIONAL; EXCISION: ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE O/1. I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Blectronically Signed Out *** Aross Description: M.D. 1) The specimen is received fresh and labeled. "right breast and axillary contents levels 1 and 2" and consists of a breast measuring 33.0 x 27.5 x 6.0 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 33.0 x 17.0 cm. Situated. centrally on the skin surface is a flattened nipple measuring 0.9 x 0.9 cm and areola measuring 4.2 cm. The skin shows bruising at the 8 o'clock positions. No definitive scars are appreciated. A suture demarcates the axillary contents which measures 11.0 x 6.5 cm. Two tags are present, designating levels 1 and 2.. black and the anterior/superior red and interior/inferior green. The The posterior surface of the breast is inked specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a firm tumor nodule measuring x 3.5 x 3.2 cm located centrally at the subareolar aspect, from the deep margin with surrounding firm satellite axtension involving a 4.2 9.0 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm area involving ali four quadrants. A full face section of located 1.0 cm the largest tumor nodule is taken, sectioned and submitted accordingly. Additional representative sections showing the satellite nodules are submitted. The remaining breast tissue shows, lobular adipose tissue with scant white fibrous breast tissue. The axillary tissue is dissected to 2 o'clock position, measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension with a grossly positive cut surface. A representative section of the lymph node is submitted. All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. All dissected lymph nodes are entirely submitted. Summary of sections: N - nipple NB - nipple base - representative skin - tumor to deep margin D TSS tumor (full face, trisected). TN-- largest tumor nodule to surrounding papillary nodules PN-- surrounding papillary tumor nodules UIQ - - upper inner quadrant lower : inner quadrant UOQ - upper  outer LOQ - lower outer quadrant  quadrant LN11-- grossly positive l1 o'clock lymph node LN1-- lymph nodes (level 1).
