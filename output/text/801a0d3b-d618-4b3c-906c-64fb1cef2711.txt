PATIENT HISTORY: The patient is a PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS. Colon cancer POST-OP DIAGNOSIS Same. FROCEDURE: Sigmoid colectomy. ADDENDA: Addendum Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies demonstrate that the adenocarcinoma has a ratio of Her-2/Neu gene to the. centromere chromosome 17 of 1.19 indicating a lack of amplification in the targeted region..  Her2/neu amplification may help in identifying those patients likely to experience shorter survival when considered together with other najor risk factors. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: COLon, sigmoid, segmental colectomy - INVAsivVe moDerAteLy DiffErenTiAteD ADenOcARcinomA (3.7 Cm) iNvaDinG into eUt not throUGH MUScULariS ProPRia WITh intramUral aBsCESS. 3.
