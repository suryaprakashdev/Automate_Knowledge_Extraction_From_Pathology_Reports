TCGA-A6-2679 SPECIMEN A. Left tube and ovary. B. Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary C. Right colon FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS A. Ovarian serous cyst adenofibroma.. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh for frozen section, labeled "left tube. and ovary" is a 658 gram, 12.0 x 10.0 x 8.7 cm. attenuated. white pink-red cystic structure, with an attached, fimbriated, 10.5. cm. fallopian tube averaging 0.25 cm. in diameter. The fallopian tube lumen is pinpoint and stellate on sectioning. On opening the. ranges from smooth white pink to wrinkled tan white-gold. No. papillations are evident. A frozen section is performed (see frozen section diagnosis)..  No definitive residual ovarian stroma is identified grossly.. Representative sections are submitted in six additional blocks. B. Received in formalin, labeled "uterus, cervix, right tube with ovary" is a 22 gram, 2.8 cm. (superior to inferior) x 2.5 cm.(cornu to cornu) x 1.5 cm.(anterior to. posterior) symmetrical uterine corpus with attached 1.5 cm. cervix and right adnexa. The serosa is smooth, tan pink-red. The 2.3 x 1.9 cm. mottled white pink-red ectocervix surrounds a 0.2 x 0.1 cm. os. The. cervical mucosa is moderately trabecular, tan pink with a 0.6 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. soft white pink endocervical polyp anteriorly (see block. 1). The triangular, 1.8 x 1.0 cm. uterine cavity is lined by flat. white pink endometrium averaging 0.15 cm. The myometrium is smooth, pale tan-pink and averages 1.0 cm. in thickness. No intramural leiomyomata are present. The cribriform tan pink-gold right ovary. measures 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The stroma is pale tan with GROSS DESCRIPTION identifiable corpora albicantia. In addition, there is a single, 0.4 cm. smooth lined serous fluid-filled cyst. The fimbriated tan. pink right fallopian tube measures 4.3 cm. in length and averages 0.3 cm. in diameter with a pinpoint stellate lumen on sectioning. Representative sections are submitted in five blocks as labeled. RS-5. BLock suMMARy: 1 - anterior cervix; 2 - posterior cervix; 3 - anterior endomyometrium; 4 - posterior endomyometrium; 5 - right tube and ovary.

C.  Received fresh labeled "right colon" is a previously. unopened 30 cm. segment of proximal right colon with. attached 11.5 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to scabrous tan pink serosa with a moderate amount of attached mesentery and mesocolon. An unremarkable, 4.5 cm. appendix averaging 0.6 cm. in. diameter is present. The proximal and distal margins measure 3.7 and 5.7 cm. in circumference respectively. On opening there is a well circumscribed, 2.8 x 2.0 rubbery white-pink-red sessile ulcerated lesion located 20 cm. from the distal margin. A portion of the tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. On sectioning the tumor has a maximal thickness of 0.7 cm., grossly extending into the muscularis to. within 0.6 cm. of the inked free radial serosal surface. The ileal mucosa and uninvolved colonic mucosa are unremarkable glistening tan pink with regular folds and the walls average 0.5 cm. in thickness. Several soft to slightly rubbery tan pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 0.9 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the attached mesocolon and mesentery. Representative sections are submitted in 13 blocks as labeled. Rs-13. BLOcK suMMARy: 1 - proxima1 and distal margins; 2 and 3 - tumor full thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 4 and 5 - GROSS DESCRIPTION central tumor; 6 - tumor to normal; 7 - Icv; 8 and 9 - random bisected largest lymph node. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A&B. Microscopic examination performed. C. Histologic type:  Invasive adenocarcinoma

Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated Primary tumor (pT): Tumor minimally invades the subserosa, pT3a/b Proximal margin: Negative Distal margin: Negative Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative Distance of tumor from closest margin: 20 cm from distal margin Vascular invasion: Negative Regional lymph nodes (pN): All 16 lymph nodes negative for metastatic disease, 0/16, pNO Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor:  None Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed Other findings: Normal appendix 14, 4x2, 5 DIAGNOSIS A. Left tube and ovary, left salpingo-oophorectomy -- Serous cystadenofibroma of ovary. Attached fallopian tube, no significant pathology.. B. Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary, total hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy -- Uterus with atrophic endometrium. Cervix with endocervical polyp. Attached atrophic right ovary with several inclusion cysts; right fallopian tube, no significant pathology. DIAGNOSIS C. Right colon, right hemicolectomy -- Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right colon, pT3. All margins are negative for tumor. All 16 regional lymph nodes are negative for metastatic disease. Appendix and portion of ileum, no significant pathology.
