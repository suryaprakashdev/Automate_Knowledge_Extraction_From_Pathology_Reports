UUID: 5E14E7CA-3417-4379-8EE3-7F00D6D4A02B TCGA-A7-A4SC-01A-PR Redacted Final Surgical Pathology Report Procedure: Diagnosis A. Right axillary sentinel node, excisional biopsy:. Single lymph node negative for metastatic tumor (0/1) B. Breast, right, simple mastectomy:. Invasive lobular carcinoma, grade 1 Tumor size 7.5 cM (pT3) Resection margin negative for tumor 1es-0-3 Microscopic Description: A. and B. Microscopic examination performed. carcinoma nifittratny Jobulu NOS Invasive carcinoma: Histologic type: Invasive lobular carcinoma 85 3s/3 Histologic grade: 1. S: bruot Nos c50.9 Overall grade: Architectural score: 3 Nuclear score: 1 Mitotic score: 1 Greatest dimension (pT) 7.5 cM (pT3) Specimen margins: Negative for malignancy, deep margin is l.4 cm from tumor Vessel invasion: Not identified Calcification: Focally present Nipple (Paget's ): Unremarkable, no Paget's disease identified Invasion of skin or chest wall: Not identified Ductal carcinoma in situ: No ductal carcinoma in situ identified. Description of non-tumorous breast: Fatty and atrophic. Adjacent to the tumor are too small 1 cm fibroadenomas which are invaded by the tumor. Lymph nodes: Number of positive nodes of total: 0/1 Extracapsular extension (present/absent): No extracapsular tumor identified pN:  snpNO 2 H&E-stained sections were evaluated from each frozen section block. An additional 3 H&E stained sections from each tissue block were evaluated of the formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Also pancytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunohistochemical stains were evaluated from each of the tissue blocks. No metastatic tumor was identified in any of these examined sections. [A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified as analyte specific reagents. These antibodies are monitored and controlled in our laboratory and their performance for in vitro diagnosis is well described in the medical literature.. been cleared or approved by the FDA.]  They have not Distant metastasis (pM): Not applicable pMX was repeated given the limited amount of tumor in the prior core biopsy.

Results Progesterone receptor: 0%. Her2 by IHC: 2+ Interpretation Estroqen receptor: Reported as positive on prior core biopsy Progesterone receptor: Negative Her2 by IHc: Equivocal by IHC. FIsh testing ordered Comments Fixation time: 28 hours Less than Cold ischemia time: Time of collection was not noted.  Favor less than 1 15 minutes cold ischemia time in the laboratory. hour of transport time. 'CAP guidelines The analyzed tissue met quality requirements of the for Her2 testing.  Control materials stained appropriately. Based on data collected in our laboratory and reported in the literature we recommend FIsh analysis for Her2 in cases that stain with intermediate intensity by immunohistochemistry.. Prognostic markers were done by immunohistochemical stain on paraffin sections from 10% neutral buffered formalin fixed tissue using Ventana corportation antibodies on a Benchmark automated stainer.. The Her2 antibody is clone 4B5 and has been approved by the FDA as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom Herceptin treatment is considered. This laboratory meets the test validation and quality assurance /CAP guidelines for Her2, ER and PR testing for requirements of the carcinoma of the breast Specimen A.  Right axillary sentinel lymph node, excisional biopsy:. B. Right breast, simple mastectomy Clinical Information year-old white female with infiltrating lobular carcinoma Intraoperative Consultation. A. Right axillary sentinel node, biopsy: No tumor seen.. Gross Description Received fresh for frozen section labeled "right axillary sentinel The fat is node" is a 3 x 1 x 1 CM piece of fatty yellow tissue. trimmed to reveal a 2.8 cm diameter tan lymph node. The lymph node is bisected and entirely frozen as frozen sections AFs 1 AFs 2.' The fat is retained..  No blue staining was identified and no grossly suspicious. areas are identified.. B. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "right breast" is a 20.5 x 17.2 x 4.7 cm yellow lobular fatty tissue fragment is grossly consistent with a mastectomy and is partially covered with a 7.5 x 3.5 cm pink-tan wrinkled skin ellipse having a 1.4 cm everted nipple. The specimen has a suture designating superior breast. The and fixed in formalin at. specimen is received in pathology at The deep aspect of the specimen is inked lumen and the. specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral to show a 7.5 x 6.0 x 2.3

cm white-tan, diffusely nodular and firm central mass is ill circumscribed and comes within 1.7 cm of the deep margin. Gross identified centrally are white rice-like pellets which are grossly consistent with a previous biopsy site. The remainder of the cut surface of the specimen is predominantly fatty scanty fibrous tissue specimen. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: 1 - entire nipple with representative skin, 2 - 6 - representative sections of lesion including tumor to deep margin and representative lower outer quadrant, 9 - representative lower inner quadrant, 10 - representative upper inner quadrant.
