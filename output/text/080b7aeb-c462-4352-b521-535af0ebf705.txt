COMMENT: These findings correspond to AJCC pathologic Stage IVA (pT4a, pN0. pMn/a). **Electronically Signed Out by M.D.** CLINICAL DATA Clinical Features: unspecified Operator: Operative Findings: unspecified Operative Diagnosis: unspecified. Tissue Submitted:1) right neck level 2,3, 2) left level 1B and perifascial node, 3) left neck level 2, 3; 4) neck dissection, level 1A; 5) total glossectomy, right level 1. GROSS DESCRIPTION: 1) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 2, 3 Received fresh, labeled "right neck level 2, 3," per requisition, is a 6.0 x 5.5 x 2.cm portion of partially circumscribed yellow-tan lobular adipose tissue with a nodularity noted on palpation. The dissected lymph nodes are submitted as follows: Summary of sections: 1A, 9 lymph nodes, 9/1; 1B, 2 lymph nodes, each bisected (1 inked black), 4/1; 1C, 2 lymph nodes each bisected (1 inked black) 4/1; 1D-1I, 1 lymph node, bisected, 2/1 each. 2) SOURCE: Left level 1B and perifascial node Received fresh labeled "left level 1B and perifascial node", per requisition, is a 5 x 4 x 1.6.cm portion of partially circumscribed. yellow-tan lobular adipose tissue with a nodularity noted on palpation. Serial sectioning shows a few circumscribed lymph nodes and a gold-tan trabecular cut surface consistent with a gland. Summary of sections: 2A, 4 lymph nodes, 4/1; 2B, section of gland tissue, 2/1. 3) SOURCE: Left Neck level 2, 3 Received fresh, labeled "left neck level 2, 3" per requisition, is a 5 x 4 x 1.8 cm aggregate of partially circumscribed yellow-tan lobular adipose tissue with a nodularity noted on palpation. Summary of sections: 3A, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 3B, 6 lymph nodes, 6/1; 3C, 2 lymph nodes, each bisected, (1 inked black), 4/1; 3D, 2 lymph nodes, each bisected 1 inked black), 4/1; 3E, 4lymph nodes, 4/1; 3F-3G, 1 lymph node bisected, 2/1 each. 4) SOURCE: Neck dissection level 1A Received fresh, labeled "neck dissection level 1A", per requisition, is a 4

x 3 x 1.2 cm portion of partially circumscribed, yellow-tan lobular adipose tissue with a nodularity noted on palpation. Summary of sections: 4A, four lymph nodes, 4/1 5) SOURCE: Total glossectomy right level 1 Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "total glossectomy right level 1" is a 224 gram total glossectomy specimen measuring 10.5 cm anterior to posterior by 9 cm from right to left by 6.2 cm from superior to inferior. There are no orientation instructions received along with the specimen. The specimen consists of a grossly identifiable tongue with a pink-tan, shaggy mucosal surface which measures 10.5 cm from anterior to posterior by 6.5 cm from right to left by approximately 3.5 cm superior to inferior. There is a small amount of adjacent pink-tan, shiny mucosa, which is consistent with the floor of the mouth. The surface of the specimen opposite the mucosa is pink-red, shaggy, and consistent with a surgical resection margin. Using anatomic landmarks for orientation, the specimen has been inked in the following manner: anterior is orange, posterior is black, right is red, left is yellow, and inferior is green. The mucosal surface is notable for an ulcerated, friable mass that is present on the right floor of mouth, extending to the lateral aspect of the tongue and measures approximately 7.5 x 5.0 cm in area. Grossly, the mass extends to within 1.0 cm of the right lateral margin and 1.5 cm of the anterior margin. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a cheesy, white-yellow mass extending approximately 4.0 cm deep to the ulceration and grossly extending to within 0.7 cm of the inferior inked margin, 0.3 cm of the right inked margin, 0.6 cm of the anterior inked margin, O.5 cm of the posterior inked margin, and appears widely free of the left inked margin. Representative sections are submitted for. evaluation. Summary of sections: 5A, left anterior mucosal margin and left anterior deep, 3/1; 5B, left lateral mucosal margin and left lateral deep, 2/1; 5C, left hypopharynx margin and left hypopharynx deep, 2/1; 5D, posterior mucosal margin and posterior deep, 2/1; 5E, right hypopharynx margin and hypopharynx deep, 2/1; 5F, right lateral mucosal margin and right lateral deep, 2/1; 5G-H, perpendicular sections of tumor approaching right lateral mucosal margin, 1/1 each; 5I-J, tumor approaching right anterior mucosal margin, 1/1 each; 5K, right anterior deep margin, 1/1; 5L, inferior margin, 1/1; 5M-N, representative sections of mass, 1/1 each; 5O,right floor mass 1/1; 5P, normal appearing posterior tongue, 1/1; 5Q, normal appearing left lateral tongue, 1/1; 5R, normal appearing anterior tongue, 1/1..
