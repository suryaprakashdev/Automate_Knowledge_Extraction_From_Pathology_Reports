S.t Ctu: brnst Nos c50.9 // Patien surgical fd  UUID:EFA0354A-641D-4EC2-A1BE-4ACC7CE421DF Surg Path Redacted CLINICAL HISTORY: Right breast Ca, rule out deep margin positive. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "#1 right'modified radical mastectomy", in formalin. Received in the container is a portion of breast with an attached skin ellipse containing the nipple and an axillary dissection. The specimen measures 18.5 x 14 x 3.9 cm. The attached skin ellipse measures 14.7 x 6.3 cm. The nipple appears grossly unremarkable. There is a small 0.5 cm hole 1.7 cm inferior to the nipple. The deep surface of the specimen is inked in blue and the specimen is serially sectioned revealing a 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm firm white mass in the medial portion of the specimen..  The mass is fairly well-circumscribed but very firm to. palpation. Grossly it appears to approach within 0.2 cm of the deep surgical margin. There is no definite biopsy cavity; however, there is a small area of hemorrhage just adjacent to the tumor mass. Tissue from the tumor mass has been sent for estrogen and progesterone receptors. Block Summary: Al- section through nipple. A2- section through hole in skin ellipse.. A3-A5- sections of tumor with adjacent deep margin. A6-A9- representative sections of tumor. A10- representative sections of upper lateral quadrant. All- representative section of lower lateral quadrant.. A12- representative section of upper medial quadrant. A13- five lymph node candidates from level three. A14-Al5- one large lymph node bisected, level three. Al6- one large lymph node bisected and one small lymph node candidate, level three. A17- one lymph node candidate bisected, level three.. A18-- one lymph node candidate bisected, level three. A19- four lymph node candidates from level II. A20- one lymph node candidate bisected from level II. A21- two lymph node candidates from level II. A22- five lymph node candidates from level I. A23- two lymph node candidates from level I. A24- two lymph node candidates from level I.. A25- two lymph node candidates from level I. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Most of the tumor consists of tubules and cribriform glands composed of atypical cells with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and oval nuclei with distinct relatively small nucleoli. There is a sparse inflammatory response. A minor non-comedo intraductal component is present, within or near the tumor mass. Away from the tumor, no intraductal carcinoma or epithelial hyperplasia is seen. DIAGNOSIS: A. "RIGHT" BREAST,  MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY: INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA (2.5 CM), NSABP HISTOLOGIC GRADE II/III, NUCLEAR GRADE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED. A NON-COMEDO INTRADUCTAL CARCINOMA COMPONENT IS IDENTIFIED, COMPRISING LESS THAN 10% OF THE CARCINOMA. NO TUMOR IS SEEN IN THE DEEP SURGICAL MARGIN. 1 of 2
