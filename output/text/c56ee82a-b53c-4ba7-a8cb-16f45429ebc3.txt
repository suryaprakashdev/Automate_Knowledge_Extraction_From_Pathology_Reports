COMMENT: This tumor has an interesting morphology with a paplliary architecture but in areas has elongated and angulated tubular. growth pattern reminiscent of mucinous and tubular spindle cell carcinoma. No distinct mucin is identified and there are many foam cells in the background. immunostains were performed and show that tunor cells are positive for CK7 and. racemase, focaily positive for CD10 and negative for CAf. While we favor this to represent a papillary renal cell carclnoma, our differential diagnosis aiso includes an unusual variant of mucinous tubular spndle cell carcinoma.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: In Situ Procedure Interpretation SPECIAL PROCEDURE REPORT MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY FLUORESCENCE iN SITU HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS Comment:  Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FIsH) tests show monosomy of chromosome 1 and 2 in approximately 66% and 54% of the tumor cells. Trisomy of chromosome 17 is seen in 25% of tumor cells.. This FiSH profile is suggestive of a mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma. However a papillary renal cell. carcinoma cannot be ruled out. Specimen type: Renal tumor. Result: 2 Signals 3 or more Signals 1 Signal 40 (65.6%) 21 (34.48) 0 (0%) CEP1 CEp2 36 (53.7%) 29 (43.3%) 2 (3.08) 44 (72.18) 4 (6.68) CEp7 13 (21.38) CEp17 11 (18.0%) 35 (57.48) 15 (24.68) Abnormality detected: Monosomy of chromosome 1 and 2 is seen In approximately 66% and 54% of the tumor colls. Trisomy of chromosome 17 is seen in 25% of tumor cells. Interpretation guidelines: Chromosomal losses are considered significant if present in greater than 30% of cells. The loss is indeterminate if present in.  20-30% of cases. The loss is considered artifactual if seen in less than 20% of cases.. Chromosomal gains are considered significant if present in greater than 20% of cells. The gain is considered artifactual if seen in less than 20% of cases. Results Probes used: CEP1 (1p11.1q11.1), CEP2 (2p11.1q11.2), CEP7 (7p11.1q11.1), CEP17 (17p11.1q11.1). At least 25 cells are analyzed. The signal distribution for targeted toci of renal carcinoma is recorded. if the test results are not. consistent with the clinical findings, and/or diagnostic, a consultation between pathologist and treating physician is warranted..
