Eneounter Date: Margins: Margin(s) involved by invasive carcinoma . Renal vein margin. Lymphovascular Invasion: Not identified Pathologic Findings in Nonneoplastic Kidney: Patchy subcortical chronic inflammation and focal glomerulosclerosis Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT3b N0 MX Number lymph node examined: 7 Number lymph node positive: 0 C. The vein wall margin of resection is negative for tumor. A detached fragment of papillary renal cell carcinoma is present in the slides, but is not adherent to the wall.. E. A systemic granulomatous process, such as sarcoidosis, should be excluded clinically. (Electronic Signature) SPECIMEN SUBMITTED A: LEFT KIDNEY B: RETRO-AORTIC VEIN C: WALL MARGIN D: THROMBUS E: PARA-CAVAL LYMPH NODES CLINICAL DATA LEFT RENAL MASS AND IVC THROMBUS GROSS DESCRIPTION A.  Received in formalin labeled "left kidney" is a specimen consisting of a left kidney surrounded by an envelope of fibroadipose tissue measuring 20.5 x 9.6 x 7.0 cm and weighing 740 grams. The kidney measures 13.5 x 6.8 x 5.0 cm. The kidney demonstrates an 8.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 cm tan soft and friable mass in the.upper and mid poles of the kidney. Extensive necrosis is identified. Focal hemorrhage is seen. The mass grossly involves the renal sinus fat. The overlying renal pelvis is unremarkable. The mass bulges the renal capsule however does not extend into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue. It is adjacent to the inked soft tissue line of resection. The tumor is sharply demarcated from the renal parenchyma which appears tan-white and pale. Satellite nodules of tumor are not present. Sectioning of the renal veins, particularly those draining the area of the mass does show the intravascular presence of neoplasm. The mass grossly involves the renal vein margin. An adrenal gland is present measuring 5.8 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm and is not involved by tumor. The adrenal cortex is yellow-orange and unremarkable. A 5 cm segment of ureter is present and is essentially unremarkable. Lymph nodes are not seen. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al ureter margin; A2 artery margin; A3 renal vein margin with mass; A4 - A5 mass with renal sinus and renal pelvis; A6 - A7 mass with soft tissue line of resection; A8 - A10 mass; Al1 uninvolved kidney; A12 adrenal. B. Received in formalin labeled "retroaortic vein" is a segment of vascular tissue measuring 3.5 cm in length and 0.9 cm in diameter.  The lumen is occluded by tan soft and friable tissue. The tissue extends to Page 2 of 3

Eneounter Date within O.5 cm of one margin and is at the opposite margin. Focal hemorrhage and necrosis is identified. The tissue is firmly adhered to the interior vascular walls. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1 involved margin; B2 opposite margin; B3 representative section. C. Received in formalin labeled "wall margin" are three segments of. tan-gray vascular wall aggregating to 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm. The wall appears unremarkable. The specimen is totally submitted in formalin in C1. D. Received in formalin labeled "thrombus" are multiple fragments of tan-brown soft and friable tissue aggregating to 5 x 5 x 2.6 cm. A segment of vascular tissue is identified measuring 4.3 cm in length and 2.8 cm in diameter. The lumen is occluded by tan soft and friable tissue. The tissue demonstrates focal hemorrhage and necrosis. Representative sections are submitted in formalin in Dl - D3.. E.  Received in formalin labeled "paracaval lymph nodes" are multiple fragments of yellow-brown fibroadipose tissue aggregating to 4.3 x 3.8 x 1.7 cm. Sectioning reveals multiple ovoid tan firm nodules resembling lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.4 to 1.7 cm. The nodules are submitted as follows: E1 four nodules; E2 three nodules; E3 two nodules.
