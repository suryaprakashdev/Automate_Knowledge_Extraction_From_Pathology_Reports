[] m.d. Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the Resident/fellow, [], M.D. Electronically signed Out by [] M.D. clinical history: The patient is a year old female with mesothelioma who undergoes left thoracotomy. Specimens Received: A: Aortic adven tissue B: AP window node c: Pericardium cyst; removal D: #7 1ymph node E: Left pluera Gross Description: Received are five containers, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. Container A is further designated "1. Aortic adven tissue." Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm pink-tan, rubbery tissue that is entirely frozen. Frozen section diagnosis is "positive for infiltrating mesothelioma" by Dr. []. The frozen section remnant is submitted entirely in cassette Alfs. Container B is further designated "2. AP window node." Received fresh and placed in formalin are four tan-brown, rubbery fragments of tissue ranging in measurement from 1.9 to 0.4 cm. The largest lymph node is bisected to revea1 a homogeneous pale, white, cut surface. The specimen is submitted as follows: B1: largest lymph node bisected b2 : four candidate lymph nodes b3: two candidate 1ymph nodes B4: remaining soft tissue Container c is further designated "3. Pericardium cyst; removal." Received fresh and placed in formalin is a pink-tan cystic mass measuring 4 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The outer surface is pink and translucent with a mild amount of adipose tissue. The wall is thin and is sectioned open to reveal approximately 5 cc' of clear to light, yellow fluid. There are no masses or lesions along the cyst wall and  it appears' to be simple unilocular cyst. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes c1-c3. placed in formalin is a 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm pink-tan lymph node. It is bisected to reveal a brown-tan, heterogenous cut surface and the specimen is submitted in cassette D1. E. Container E is further designated "5. Left pluera." Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 150.9 gram, 12.5 x 11.8'x 2.5 cm aggregate of pleura. The specimen arrived in multiple pieces and comes unoriented. The majority of the specimen has thin, pink-tan, translucent pleura but there are areas of tan-white thickening. The largest nodular area measures 9.5 x 5.5 x 3 cm. The volume of the specimen is 250~cc. A second fragment contains a 4 x 2 x 3.5 cm white-tan, firm' to rubbery nodule. It is serially sectioned to reveal a fairly homogeneous tan-white-pink, cut surface. Sectioning of the larger nodule reveals a tan-white to focally yellow cut surface. The tumor in most areas appears delineated from the surrounding muscle and soft tissue but in other areas appears to be within the muscle. The specimen is submitted as follows: E1-e8: multiple sections of largest nodule with surrounding soft tissue Page 2
