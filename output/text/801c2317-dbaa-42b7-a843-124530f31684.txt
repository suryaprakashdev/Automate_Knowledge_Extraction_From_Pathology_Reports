Patient history: The patient is a three or more mets involving liver. Bilateral renal masses which are solid and cystic. Previous cerebral vascular accident with history of hypertension.. PRE OP DiAGNO$IS: Colon cancer. Post op Diagnosis: Same.  PROCEDURE: Liver biopsy, right hemicolectomy, open cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound, right nephrectomy. ADDENDA: Addendum Fiuorescent in situ hybridization studies have been performed on the poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma. The ratio of HER-2/neu to the centromere of chromosome 17 is 1.70, indicating low level HER-2/neu amplification in the targeted region. Her2/neu amplification may help in identifying those patients Jikely to experience shorter survival when considered. tdgether with other major risk factors.. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Part 1: Liver, biopsy - METaSTaTIC mUcinoUS ADenOCArciNomA, CONSIStenT wITh PATIenT'S COLOn PrImAry (see comment). Part 2: Gallbladder, cholecystectomy - GALLBLADDER WITH CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS PART 3: KIDNEY, RIGHT,EXCISION OF MASS- A. muLTIpLe ReNaL COrTICaL CyStS WITh ASSOCIaTEd hemoRRhAge AnD ORganIzINg hemaToMA. B. NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY. PART 4: COLON, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY -  INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA WITH AREAS OF MUCINOUS DIFFERENTIATION see comment), B. THE CARCINOMA SHOWS INVASION THROUGH MUSCULARIS PROPRIA AND INTO SEROSAL ADIPOSE TISSUE. C. METaSTATIC ADENOCaRCINOMA IS PRESENT WITHIN ONE OF TEN LyMPH NODES, 4.O CM, WITH FOCAL EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION. ALL EXAMINED RESECTION MARGiNS ARE FREE OF TUMOR. E. Stage: t4 n1 m1, Duke c, Astler collier c2. APPENDIX WITh nO SIGNIFICanT PATHOLOGIC CHANGE. COMMEN Much of this tumor is a well differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the pericolonic lymph node metastasis from part 4 is of this pattern. However, some of the deeply invasive tumor is mucinous, and this pattern is present in the liver biopsy. Trichrome and PAS stains were performed on the liver biopsy ( part 1). The trichrome stain highlights desmoplastic fibrosis within the metastatic carcinoma. The PAS stain highlights intracellular and extracellular mucin within the metastatic carcinoma.
