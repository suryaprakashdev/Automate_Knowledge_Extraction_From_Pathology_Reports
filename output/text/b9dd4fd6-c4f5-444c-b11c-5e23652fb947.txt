In Situ Component necrosis: Comedo-type necrosis is present In Situ Component extent/size: Ductal carcinoma in situ comprises approximately 20% of the tumor volume. A precise span for the DCiS cannot be determined, however, DCiS is present in seven of eighteen tissue sections evaluated. predominantly in the vicinity of the invasive ductal carcinoma.

Invasive carcinoma is greater than 5 mm from all margins.. In Situ component: Negative. DCiS is greater than 5 mm from all margins. Axillary lymph nodes (see also parts A, B, and F): Total number with metastasis: 14 (includes two lymph nodes with micrometastases) Total number examined: 23 Size of largest metastasis: estimated at greater than 2.0 cm (part A) Extracapsular extension: Present Microcalcifications: Focally present in association with ductal carcinoma in situ and with columnar cell change. Other findings:. - Atypical lobular hyperplasia - Flat epithelial atypia. - Sclerosing adenosis. - Apocrine cysts and apocrine metaplasia - Fibrosis and hemorrhage in keeping with prior biopsy site - Skin without diagnostic histopathologic change AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2(m) pN3a Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. E: Lymph node, right Level 3 axillary, removal - Metastatic carcinoma present in two of two lymph nodes (2/2). Size of largest metastatic foci: 6 mm; 5 mm Extracapsular extension: Not definitively identified F: Lymph node, right axillary Level 1 and 2, regiona! node dissection. - Metastatic carcinoma present in eight of seventeen lymph nodes (8/17) Size of largest metastatic focus: 12 mm Extracapsular extension: Present Note: In one lymph node, the metastatic focus measures only 0.2 mm (micrometastasis).

- Lymphovascular space invasion is present. Comment: Ithough the gross description mentions Mass A and Mass B, histologic sections of intervening tissue shows patchy involvement by ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma. Mass A and Mass B are therefore regarded as a single mass with a largest measurement of 3.7 cm (stage pT2). Multiple additional smaller foci of invasive carcinoma are. present, which are greater than grossly distinct from the large mass, including one nodule of invasive carcinoma identified in a separate (lower outer) quadrant (multifocal and multicentric disease).. Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:. A frozen section was requested by Dr.. FSA1: Sentinel lymph node #1, right axilla, sentinel node biopsy. - Positive for metastatic carcinoma.. Frozen Section Pathologist: Clinical History: with right breast IDC, well differentiated, undergoing lumpectomy with axillary node dissection. Gross Description: Received are six appropriately labeled containers. Container A is additionally labeled "right sentinel node #1." It holds a 6 x 3 x 1.4 cm fragment of red/tan fibrofatty tissue containing a 5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm lymph node candidate from which two representative sections are frozen as FSA1. The. remaining lymph node tissue is submitted in blocks A1-A4. Fat remains in formalin. Container B is additionally labeled "right axillary palpable node." it holds a 4.5 x 4.0 x 1.2 cm red/tan fibrofatty tissue. fragment containing three lymph node candidates measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm, 0.6 cm and 0.4 cm. The two smaller Iymph node candidates are submitted in block B1. The largest lymph node candidate is sectioned and submitted in blocks B2 and B3. Fat remains in formalin.. Container C is additionally labeled "right posterior margin, clip posterior." It holds a 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm markedly cauterized fragment of yellow/gray fibromuscular tissue and fat. There is a clip present on one surface which is inked blue and the opposite surface is inked black. The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted in blocks C1-C2, Container D is additionally labeled "right total mastectomy, stitch marks axillary tail." Specimen fixation: formalin Time in fixative: 9 hours ype of mastectomy: total mastectomy Weight of specimen: 900 grams.

Size of specimen: 26.6 x 21.2 x 6.3 cm Orientation of specimen: Anterior=blue, posterior-black, axillary tail=yellow Skin ellipse dimensions: 22.6 x 9.1 cm Nipple/areola: 1.7/5.0 cm Axillary tail: submitted separately Biopsy site: not identified Discrete Mass(es): present Number of discrete masses: two (designated A and B) Size of mass (es)/biopsy site: Mass A: 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm Mass B: 1.1 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm Location of mass(es): Mass A: upper outer quadrant (1A) Mass B: The mass is located 1.8 cm posterior and inferior to the lateral edge of Mass A. Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: Mass A: The mass is located 3.3 cm from the black inked deep margin, 1.5 cm from the closest blue inked soft tissue margin, 11 cm from the medial margin, and 10 cm from the lateral margin. Mass B: The mass is located 0.8 cm from the black inked posterior margin, 4 cm from the closest blue inked anterior margin.. Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: absent Description of remaining breast: composed of dense and nodular white/tan fibroconnective tissue encompassing the mass; this is most prominent in the central/subareolar portion of the breast where there is dense blue dye staining The breast tissue between Mass A and Mass B is firm and hemorrhagic with fat necrosis. Sections are taken of the intervening parenchyma (D3 and D4). If Mass A and Mass B are contiguous, the overall measurements of the lesion would be 3.7 x 3.1 x 3.0 cm. Other remarkable features: There is a small amount of soft tissue hemorrhage and fat necrosis along the superior lateral edge of the mass. Multiple 0.3 0.4 cm firm nodules are identified radiating from the main mass towards the medial aspect of the breast. These are extensively sampled. Tissue submitted for special investigations: tumor and normal are given to Block Summary:
