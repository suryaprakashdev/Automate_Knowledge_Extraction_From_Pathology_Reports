(A) LEFT VAS - A white-tan portion of vas deferens measuring 5 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. A lumen is present on the cut surfaces. Specimen is representatively submitted in A. (B) LEFT URETER -- A segment of ureter 0.8 cm long and 0.1 cm in diameter with surrounding fibroadipose tissue. The resection margin is inked by the surgeon and entire. specimen is submitted for frozen in block B (ink side down, en face). *FS/DX: BENIGN URETER. (C) RIGHT VAS -- A segment white-tan vas deferens measuring 5.5 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. A pinpoint lumen is visible in the cut surfaces. Specimen is representatively submitted in C. (D) RIGHT URETER-- A segment of ureter (1.0 x 0.7 cm). The margin, designated by the surgeon with ink, is reinked blue and submitted en face for frozen section in D. *FS/DX: BENIGN URETER (E) BLADDER, PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A cystoprostatectomy measuring overall (14 x 7.5 x 7 cm). The specimen is opened longitudinally through the superior wall to reveal a fungating tumor (9 x 7 x 2.5 cm) involving the near entire  anterior bladder wall and dome. The tumor appears to invade the muscular wall of the. bladder but does not extend into the perivesical adipose tissue.  The remaining bladder mucosa shows hemorrhage, especially in the trigone, and is other unremarkable.. INK CODE: Black - outer surface of anterior wall SECTION CODE: E1-E48, bladder with tumor; E49-E57, prostate; E58, E59, urethra, en face.. (F) RIGHT COMMON ILIAC LYMPH NODES - A singIe red tan piece of tissue measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Three potential lymph nodes are palpated, ranging in size from 0.4 to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. No tumor is seen grossly. Specimen is entirely submitted. SECTION CODE: F1, three potential lymph nodes; F2, remainder of specimen. (G) RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODE - Multiple red tan pieces of adipose tissue measuring 4.9 x 4 x 1 cm in aggregate. Five possible lymph nodes are found, ranging in size from 0.5 to 3.7 cm in greatest dimension. No tumor is seen grossly. Specimen is entirely submitted. SECTION CODE: G1, three potential lymph nodes; G2, G3, single lymph node; G4, G5, single lymphnode. (H) RIGHT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODE - Multiple red tan pieces of adipose tissue measuring 5 x 2.5 x 2 cm in aggregate. Seven potential lymph nodes are found, ranging in size from 0.4 to 2.6 cm in greatest dimensions. No tumor is seen grossly. SECTION CODE: H1, four potential lymph nodes; H2, one potential lymph node; H3, one potential lymph node; H4, H5, single lymph node, sectioned. (I) LEFT COMMON ILIAC -- Received is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm portion of fibroadipose tissue, which yields multiple possible lymph nodes, ranging from 0.6 cm to 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely. SECTION CODE: I1, three lymph nodes; I2, two lymph nodes.

(J) LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC -- Received is a 5.0 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm portion of fibroadipose tissue which yields two possible lymph nodes, measuring 2.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm and 3.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. Both lymph nodes are submitted entirely. SECTION CODE: J1, one lymph node; J2, J3, one lymph node, serially sectioned. (K) LEFT OBTURATOR - Multiple fibroadipose tissue fragments (6.5 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm) Eleven possible lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension are identified and are submitted in toto. SECTION CODE: K1, four Iymph nodes; K2, three lymph nodes; K3, one lymph node, bisected; K4, one lymph node, bisected; K5, one lymph node, bisected; K6, one lymph node, bisected. (L) LEFT URETER FINAL MARGIN A segment of ureter (1.7 x 0.6 cm). The true margin. designated by the surgeon with ink, is reinked blue and submitted en face in L. (M) RIGHT URETER FINAL MARGIN -- A segment of ureter (0.8 x 0.8 cm). The margin, designated by the surgeon with ink, is reinked blue and submitted en face in M CLINICAL HISTORY None given.
