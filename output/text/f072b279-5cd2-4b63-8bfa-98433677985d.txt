system for Bladder of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the. International Union Against Cancer (UICC). xx [] MD Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the Resident/Fellow, [l], MB, PhD Electronically Signed Out by [] MD Clinical History: The patient is a  year-old male with invasive urothelial carcinoma, high grade. undergoing cystoprostatectomy. Specimens Received: A: Right pelvic lymph node B: Left pelvic lymph node. C: Left pelvic lypmh node. D: Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicle, vas deferens Gross Description: The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. A. The first container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes and 7 are found measuring 0.3-4.5 cm in greatest dimension and are submitted as follows: A1: 3 lymph node candidates A2-A4: 1 bisected lymph node in each cassette A5-A6: 1 lymph node, sectioned B. The second container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph node". Received fresh for intraoperative consult is a 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.6 cm yellow-tan tissue fragment which is bisected to reveal a 2.2 cm white-tan lymph. node candidate. A representative section is frozen and called "metastatic carcinoma" by Dr. [] The frozen remnant is submitted as B1 FS and the remaining lymph node candidate is submitted as B2-B4. C. The third container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph node" Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 10.5 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of

yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph node candidates. Sections are submitted as follows: C1: 5 lymph node candidates C2: 2 lymph node candidates C3: 1 lymph node candidate, bisected C4: 1 lymph node candidate C5: 1 lymph node candidate C6-7: 1 lymph node, sectioned D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles and vas deferens".. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 393.7 g, 16.5 x 15.5 x 4.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 7 x 6 x 3.5 cm bladder with attached mesenteric fat and a 4.3 x 4 x 3 cm prostate. The right seminal vesicles measure 4.2 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm and right vas deferens measures 9.5 cm in length by 0.2-0.5 cm in diameter. The left seminal vesicles measures 4.5 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm and left vas deferens measures 10.5 cm in length by 0.2-0.5 cm in diameter. The right ureteral stump measures 1.6 cm in length by 0.6 cm in diameter, the left measures 2 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter, and both demonstrate intact, patent lumens to the trigone. The right half of the prostate is inked blue and the left half is inked black. The soft tissue surrounding the bladder is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra. The prostate is surrounded by a thin intact membranous capsule and sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity with no discrete masses or indurations. Approximately 50% of the gland is submitted.. The opened bladder reveals a 2.8 x 2.7 cm indurated, tan-yellow shaggy ulcerated mass with a hyperemic rim in the left lateral wall which partially extends to the anterior, posterior, and trigone and involving the left ureter orifice. The ulceration is 5 cm from the distal urethral margin and 0.7 cm from the prostate base. On cut section, the mass extends to the serosa, possibly the  peri-vesicular adipose tissue to a depth of 1.1 cm and is 0.2 cm from the deep  margin. The surrounding bladder mucosa is tan-pink to red and edematous with a uniform 0.9 cm wall thickness. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1: Left ureter margin D2: Right ureter margin D3: Distal urethral margin D4: Prostatic apical margin D5-D8: Representative right prostate D9-D12 Representative left prostate
