I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment RECUT Gross Description: 1.) The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "sigmoid colon distal end is open.It consists of a sigmoid colon that measures 13.5 cm in length and 7.5 cm in greatest circumference. The serosal surface is tan-red and smooth. The proximal margin is inked black and the distal margin is inked blue. The specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 5.0 cm from the proximal margin and 8.0 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 2.2 cm in length and 1.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 0.8 cm, which is 0.5 cm from the closest radial margin. The remaining mucosa shows no gross anomalies. Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible ** Continued on next page **
