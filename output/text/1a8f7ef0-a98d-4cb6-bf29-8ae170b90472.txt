The lymph node is submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section. 8. Received fresh is an irregular fragment of fbroadipose tissue, measuring 3.2 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm. Four lymph nodes are. grossly identified. The lymph nodes are submitted in toto as follows: One lymph node for frozen. 2 Lymph node for frozen soction. c. Received fresh is an irregular fragment of fibroadipose tissue, measuring 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm. One lymph node is grossly identified. The lymph node is submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section. D.

SURGICAL PATHOL Report tan mass is identified measuring 2.3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The mass is 1 cm from the lateral margin up to 1.6 cm from the  superior margin, 0.5 cm from the inferior margin, 0.5 cm from the posterior margin, 0.4 cm from the media margin and 0.4 cm from the anterior margin from the skin. Other areas of the mastectomy specimen show unremarkable ibroadipose tissue. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1 Lateral margin. 2  Superior margin 3 Anterior margin and skin in relation with the tumor 4  Medial margin in relation with the tumor 5 Posterior margin in relation with the tumor 6 Inferior margin in relation with the tumor 7-8 Other areas of the mass E.
