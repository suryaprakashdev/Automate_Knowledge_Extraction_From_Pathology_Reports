FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued) : mass.  These foci likely represent extension of the main tumor rather than true multifocal carcinoma.. ** Report Electronically Signed Out ** CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: {None Given} GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name. and designated "LEFT BREAsT" is a 413 gram simple mastectomy specimen oriented with sutures (long lateral, short superior) measuring 22 cm medial to lateral, 16 cm superior to inferior, and 4.8 cm anterior to posterior. An. ellipse of unremarkable nipple bearing skin measuring 5.5 x 3 cm is present. The specimen is inked as foliows: blue superior superficial, green inferior superficial, black deep. Sectioning reveals a 3.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm firm poorly defined mass at the 2-3:00 position, 0.2 cm from the inked. deep margin. The cut surface of the tumor is yellow tan and gritty. The remaining tissue is mostly fatty with admixed patches of white fibrous tissue located centrally. Two sections of tumor, a single section of skin, and a single section of grossly normal breast are collected for CBcp protocol with matched paraffin sections in A2, A3, Al, and A4 respectively. The specimen was in formalin for 76 hours and 5 minutes. Summary of cassettes:. Al: skin A2: tumor lateral A3: tumor medial A4: grossly normal breast central. A5-A7: random additional sections of tumor. A8: left upper outer quadrant. A9: left upper inner quadrant Al0: left lower outer quadrant. All: left lower inner quadrant A12: nipple.
