No immunoreactive tumor cells present PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR: Performed on this specimen No immunoreactive tumor cells present HER2/NEU IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STUDIES: Performed on this specimen. Negative (Score 0) MICROCALCIFICATIONS: Present in non-neoplastic tissue Specimen Source A RT Breast and Axillary Contents Clinical Information None PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Right breast CA POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Right modified mastectomy Gross Description The specimen is labeled "RIGHT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS" and is received unfixed (the specimen is in formalin for more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours). It consists of a 420 g right mastectomy with axillary contents weighing 420 g measuring 18 x 10 x 3.0 cm. The axillary content measures 6.0 x 5.5 x 3.0. cm. The nipple is unremarkable measures l.3 x 1.3 cm in maximum dimensions. Solar is unremarkable. The left. fascia is smooth and glistening. The anterior margin is inked red and the deep posterior margin is inked black. On sectioning, there is a well-circumscribed lobulated focally hemorrhagic pink-tan mass measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. The mass is close to the deep posterior margin in the outer quadrant close to the axillary contents. The mass is 0.7 cm from the anterior margin and approximately 12 cm from the nipple. On further sectioning the. breast parenchyma is nodular, there are no other lesions grossly identified. There are four fatty lymph nodes.

ESTROGEN RECEPTORS: 0 %, NEGATIVE. PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: 0 %, NEGATIVE. STAINING INTENSITY:  HER-2NEU: SCORE 0, NEGATIVE. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block A2) using the following monoclonal antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1), Progesterone receptor(Clone 1E2) and Her-2neu( Clone 4B5); control sections for HER-2Neu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF-7, score 1+ T-47D, score 2+ MDA-MB-453, score 3+ BT-474). Detection system used: polymer. Primary antibodies, reagents and control sections for HER-2neu are all provided by. All controls show appropriate reactivity. Reactivity of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors is determined based on the percentage of positively stained nuclei of tumor cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells. Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells. Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong

Ordered by HER-2neu reactivity is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage): Score 0 = Negative: No immunoreactivity, or faint weak immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive.. Score 1 -- Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive. Score 2+ -- Equivocal: Weak to moderate complete membrane immunoreactivity in >10% of tumor cells or circumferential intense membrane staining in <30% of cells. Score 3+ = Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform membrane staining. A homogeneous (chicken wire) pattern should be present. Equivocal results for HER-2neu (Score 2+) will be subsequently followed by a reflex dual-color ISH testing. Additional immunohistochemical studies fpr AE1/AE3 were performed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (Blocks Al1-13) with adequate positive and negative control sections. All stains were negative. The performance characteristics of these antibodies were determined by the . They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
