GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE Received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container labeled with the patient's name and designated "para aortic lymph node r/o TCC vs. renal cell" is a 3.1 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm firm, pink-tan lymph node. The specimen is inked black and sectioned to show a tan nodular cut surface. Specimen is entirely submitted as follows: A1: frozen section material. A2: remaining lymph node. B. LEFT KIDNEY Received fresh, labeled with the patients name and "left kidney" is an intact kidney with attached perinephric fat measuring 14.9 x 8.3 x 6.2 cm, and weighing 346 grams collectively. The isolated kidney measures 13 x 6.9 x 3.3 cm. Extending from the renal pelvis are a ureter (7 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter), renal vein (1.2 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter), and renal artery (1.1 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in diameter). Tumor grossly appears to extend into the ureter and but is not present at the resection margin. There is a 9.5 x 6.5 x 3.3 cm poorly circumscribed, solid to partially cystic, variegated mass with hemorrhage and necrosis in the lower pole involving the cortex, medulla and invading into the renal pelvis. It is adjacent to the renal hilum. The mass grossly appears to invade perinephric fat. The uninvolved renal parenchyma is tan-brown with a well-defined cortico-medullary junction. There is a 4 x 2 x 0.4 cm adrenal gland without focal lesions. No lymph nodes or stones are identified. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. B1: ureteral margin B2: vascular margins B3-B6: tumor closest to capsule B7-B8: tumor with ureter, shave B9-B10: tumor with ureter

B11: tumor and perihilar fat B12: tumor with capsule B13: tumor with peri-peneprhic fat B14: kidney B15: adrenal B16-B20: additional sections, tumor with renal pelvis C. PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODES Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and designated "paraaortic lymph nodes' is a 7 x 5.5 x 3.2 cm aggregate of red, firm tissue. On section, multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm to 5.1 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. The cut surfaces of the largest lymph nodes are tan and firm. The specimen is submitted as follows: C1-C5: representative sections, largest lymph node C6-C8: representative sections, 3 cm lymph node C9: matted lymph nodes, bisected C10: matted lymph nodes, bisected C11: 4 possible lymph nodes C12: 4 possible lymph nodes CLINICAL HISTORY: None given PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left renal mass ADDENDUM: ASPsCR1-TFE3 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe Case No Outside Case No NA Pathologist Analytical Interpretation of Results: ASPSCR1/TFE3 translocation negative Clinical Interpretation of Results: Translocation involving ASPSCR1 (also known as ASPL) at 17q25 to the transcription factor TFE3 at Xp11.1 was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a proprietary probe set labeled in the  Fusion signals of the ASPSCR1 locus and the TFE3 locus were not identified in this specimen. These. results do not exclude a TFE3 translocation in this tumor as such tumors in the kidney can. have multiple fusion partners.

These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the the. They have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Overview of this test The ASPSCR1-TFE3 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe is designed to detect the juxtaposition of ASPSCR1 (also known as ASPL) to the transcription factor TFE3. Translocation of. ASPSCR1 (also known as ASPL) to the transcription factor TFE3, der(17)t(X;17)(p11.2;q25), is characteristic of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and present in the majority of cases. The ASPSCR1 PDGFB Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe is a mixture of the ASPSCR1 probe (BAC clones RP11-756O14, RP11-455O6 and RP11-428B22 centromeric of ASPSCR1) labeled with SpectrumGreen and the TFE3 probe labeled with SpectrumOrange (BAC clones RP11-552E4, RP11-344N17 and RP11-753G22 telomeric of TFE3). The expected pattern in a normal nucleus hybridized with the ASPSCR1-TFE3 probe is the two orange, two green signal pattern. In a nucleus. harboring the der(17)t(X;17)(p11.2;q25), the most common pattern is one orange signal, one green signal, and one orange/green (yellow) fusion signals resulting from the reciprocal translocation.
