Specimens Submitted: 1: sp: Left breast with level 1 and low level 2 axillary contents 2: Sp: Additional level 2 left axillary contents 3: Sp: Left level 2 and level 3 axillary contents DIAGNOSIS: UUID:C2976F78-89AF-4461-8D22-BFE8C0504722 BREAST WITH LEVEL I AND LOW LEVEL II AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEFT; TCGA-AO-A03L-01A-PR 1) Redacted MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY AND AXILLARY LYMPH NODE DISSECTION: - TWO SEPARATE TUMOR NODULES: ONE IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT AND SHOWS AN INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED (HISTOLOGIC GRADE III/III, NUCLEAR GRADE III/III). MEASURING 3.9 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION GROSSLY. THE SECOND IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER AND LOWER OUTER QUADRANTS AT 3:OO AND ISS COMPOSED OF PRKDOMINANTLY DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) WITH SEVERAL FOCI OF INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED AND SIMILAR TO ABOVE, RANGING IN SIZE FROM LESS THAN O.1 CM TO ABOUT O.4 CM. THE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) IS OF THE SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM TYPES WITH HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, EXTENSIVE NECROSIS AND FOCALLY INVOLVES A LARGE LACTIFEROUS DUCT OF THE NIPPLE. - CALCIFICATIONS ARE PRESENT IN THE IN SITU AND INVASIVE CARCINOMA, AND INS BENIGN BREAST PARENCHYMA. . VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. - NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE SURGICAL MARGINS BY EITHER INVASIVE OR IN SITU CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED. -NO SKIN INVOLVEMENT BY CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.

2) AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEFT ADDITIONAL LEVEL II; DISSECTION TWELVE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/12). AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEFT LEVELS II AND III; DISSECTION: THREE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/3). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Blectronically Signed Out ***. Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment ER-C pr-c HER2-C NEG CONT IMM RECUT NEG-HER2 Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Left breast with level 1 and. low level 2 axillary contents, stitch marks axillary contents" and consists of a breast with attached axillary tail. The breast measures 37.0 x 26.0 x 6.7 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 36.5 x 18.0 cm...  Situated ons the skin surface is an everted nipple measuring 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.1 cm and areola measuring 4.8 x 4.5 cm. The skin shows no visible scars.. A suture demarcates the axillary tail which measures 1l.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm. posterior surfaca of the breast is inked black and the specimen is serially The Sectioned to reveal a white tan firm ill-defined mass in the upper outer quadrant measuring 3.9 x 3.7 x 3.3 cm, located 1.5 from the deep margin. There is a biopsy site identified in the lower outer quadrant, corresponding to the three o'ciock position, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm.. The remaining breast tissue shows predominantly yellow lobulated adipose tissue admixed with white-tan fibrous soft tissue with no other gross identifiable lesions. The axillary tissue is dissected to reveal several grossly positive lymph nodes, measuring up to 4.5 cm. Representative sections of the mastectomy. specimen and ali identified axillary lymph nodes are submitted (the large grossly positive lymph nodes are representatively submitted). Tissue is taken for Tps. Sumnary of sections: N - nipple NB - nipple base D deep margin tumor ** Continued on next page **
