OOPHORECTOMY-BI, COLECTOMY-RIGHT GROSS DESCRIPTION A. The specimen is submitted fresh as "right colon" and consists of a segment of large bowel removed in continuity with cecum and terninal ileum. The proximal and distal margins are joined with a line of metallic staples. The ileal segment measures 4.5 cm in length and 1.5 an in diameter at the partially stapled proximal margin. The colonic segment including cecum measures 13 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter at the partially stapled distal margin. The serosa is pink with a scant amount of membranous adhesions and a moderate amount of pericolic fat. There is puckered 2.5 cm area at the cecal pouch. The vermiform appendix is not rossly identified. The lumen contains a small amount of hemorrhagic fecal material. The mucosal surfaces are pink tan with the usual folds and a large nodular 6.5 x3.5 x 2.5 cm tumor which fills the cecal pouch. The tumor is firmly fixed to the underlying muscularis and corresponds to the puckering previously described.The radial mesenteric margin measures 9 cm in length. Sectioning reveals the tumor to infiltrate nearly the entire thickness of the bowel wall approaching O.1 cm of the inked (black) serosa. There are two small sessile tan 0.2 cm nodules at a distance of 1l and 5 cm from the distal margin of resection.Also noted is a O.6 cn area of submucosal hemorrhage at a distance of 3 cm from the distal margin. Examination of the attached adipose tissue reveals sixteen moderately firm to firm pink and pale white nodules ranging 0.3 to l.5 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted,multiple 10)labeled asfollows: Cassette 1: Margins (proximal margin green dye,distal margin blue dye) Cassettes 2-5: Tumor deep margin black) Cassette 6: Sessilepolyp Cassette.7: Submucosal hemorrhage Cassettes 8-10: Nodules found in the attached pericolic fat Please note: A portion of tissue is collected for TcGA studies.

B. The specimen is submitted fresh as "right ovary" and consists of a segment of fallopian tube with attached ovary The fallopian tube includes the fimbria and measures cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. There is a O.4 cm plastic ligation ring at the proximal margin. The lumen is patent. The ovary measures 3 x 3 x 3 cm. The external surface is yellow white and lobulated. Sectioning reveals multiple serous cysts with a smooth lining ranging 0.3 to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and a firm 2 cm pink white whorled nodule. Representative sections are submitted,9 (6) 1abeled "1 to 6. C. The specimen is submitted fresh as "left ovary" and consists of a segment of fallopian tube with attached ovary The fallopian tube is stretched across the ovarian surface and includes the fimbria measuring 6 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The ovary lobulated with membranous adhesions. Secti.oning reveals a multiloculated serous cyst with a smooth lining and a small O.7 cm area of tan papillary projections.
