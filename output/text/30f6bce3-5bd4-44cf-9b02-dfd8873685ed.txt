NAME: SURG PATH #: MR #: ALT ID #: pMX: Cannot be assessed The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, as it reflects only current pathologic data and does not  incorporate full knowledge of the patient's clinical status and/or prior pathology. Pursuant to the this case has been concurrently reviewed by the following pathologist: who agrees with the above diagnosis. Attestation: By this signature, I attest that I have personally formulated the final interpretation expressed in this report and that the above diagnosis is based  upon my examination of the slides and/or other material indicated in this report. ***Electronically Signed Out By*** Interpreted by: Gross Description: A.Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "renal mass" is a 5.5 x 4.5 x 4.2 cm partial nephrectomy specimen.The margin is designated by a suture. The margin is inked black and the capsule is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.9 cm encapsulated yellow gold mass that is adjacent to the margin but not extending through the margin grossly. The mass is also adjacent to the blue capsule. The uninvolved kidney is tan-brown, pale and unremarkable. A representative section of the mass to the margin is submitted in cassette A1FS for frozen and permanent sections. Additional representative sections are submitted in cassettes A2-A7. B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "peritumor fat" are multiple tan-pink irregular unoriented tissue fragments. No discrete mass is identified grossly. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassettes B1-B3. Intraoperative Consultation: A1FS, kidney, "renal mass": Margins free of involvement.
