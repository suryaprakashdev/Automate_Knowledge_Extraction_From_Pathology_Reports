GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY, BILATERAL LEVEL II, III, IV LYMPH NODE DISSECTION AND LEFt THyroiDectoMy - A total laryngectomy with attached bilateral neck lymph node dissection measures 11.0 x 11.0 x 5.0 cm in toto. The attached left lobe of thyroid is measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. A tracheostomy is also present. An ill-defined tan firm mass measuring 5.0 x 2.0 cm to the depth of 2.0 cm is present at left pyriform sinus with extension to left epiglottic fold. The tumor invades into thyroid cartilage. The tumor is 0.4 cm from the. closest left pharyngeal mucosa (additional margin from this side has been additionally submitted (part C. The base of tongue is also submitted. separatelypart B)The right pharyngeal mucosa is 1.0 cm from the tumor. The thyroid, Taryngeal mucosa,hyoid bone and thyroid are free of tumor. A portion of the tumor and normal mucosa have been obtained for additional studies.
