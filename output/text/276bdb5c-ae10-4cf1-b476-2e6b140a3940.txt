SLN #1 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "SLN #1 right axilla" is a piece of fibroadipose tissue, 4.5 x 3.1 x 1 cm. It is searched for lymph nodes. Four lymph nodes are identified measuring 2.5 x 1.1 x 0 .6 cm, 1.5 x 1.1 x 1 cm, 0.6 x 0.4 x 0 .2 cm, and 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The 3 smaller lymph nodes are inked orange, green, and black; the lymph nodes are bisected and half of each is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. Lymph nodes are submitted entirely: FSA1: frozen section of 2 lymph nodes, bisected (1/2 of each) FSA2: frozen section of 2 lymph nodes, bisected (1/2 of each) A3: remainder of lymph nodes from FSA1 A4: remainder of lymph nodes from FSA2 B. RIGHT BREAST  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast" is an oriented 1697g, 38 x 30 x 3cm simple mastectomy with 23 x 20cm tan-brown skin ellipse and 1.3cm everted nipple. Ink code: anterior-superior: blue, anterior-inferior: orange, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned into 19 slices from lateral to medial with nipple in slice 10 revealing a 4cm area of scar tissue, with a 1cm central previous biopsy site, 4.6cm from the deep margin in the UIQ of slice 12. The specimen is radiographed and 3 biopsy clips are identified (in the UC of slice 10, and two in the UIQ of slice 12), 1.5cm from the closest anterior-superior margin in the UIQ of slice 12. A second possible 1 x 0.9 x 0.7cm previous biopsy site is identified in 3.8cm from the deep margin in the UOQ of slice 7.

RIGHT BREAST UPPER OUTER QUADRANT Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and *upper outer quadrant" is an oriented (suture at final anterior margin) 30 g, 11.3 x 3.7 x 0.9 cm fibrofatty tissue. Final margin is inked biack. Serial sectioning reveals no discrete lesions. Representatively submitted in cassette C1-C3. D. RIGHT BREAST LATERAL FLAP

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast lateral flap" is an oriented (suture at final anterior margin) 16 g, 6.6 x 3.9 x 1.2 cm fibrofatty tissue. Final margin is inked black. Serial sectioning reveals no discrete lesions. Representatively submitted in cassettes D1-D3. E. LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY TAIL Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast and axillary tail" is an oriented. 1844g, 30 x 27 x 5cm modified radical mastectomy with 25 x 21cm tan-brown skin ellipse and 1.5cm everted nipple. Ink code: anterior-superior: blue, anterior-inferior: orange, posterior-black. The specimen. is serially sectioned into 13 slices from medial to lateral with nipple in slices 5-9 revealing a 4 x 3 x 2.8cm tan-white firm well-circumscribed mass in the UOQ of slices 9-10, 3cm from the deep margin. A dense firm ill-defined fibrous area 2cm in greatest dimension is identified in the UC of slice 6, 2.5cm from the closest posterior margin. The axillary tail is 11 x 10 x 4cm. Dissection reveals 18 lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2cm to 1.4 x 1 x 1cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:.

ADDITIONAL AXILLARY CONTENTS Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "additional axillary contents" are pieces of yellow-tan fat in aggregate, 3.6 x 2.8 x 0.6 cm; containing a lymph node, 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm.
