Diagnosis: 2. Resected section of colon (sigmoid) with an ulcerated colon carcinoma characterized histologically as a moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, clearly extending up to 11 cm to the oral resection margin, measuring a max of 3 cm in diameter. Invasive spread of the tumor within all intestinal wall layers to the adjacent mesocolic fatty tissue. Otherwise the intestinal wall has several pseudodiverticula with chronic scarring peridiverticulitis. The preparation has a tumor-free seminal vesicle attached aborally. Oral and aboral resection margins are tumor-free. The tumor stage of the colon carcinoma described in (2) is therefore pT3, G2, RO.
