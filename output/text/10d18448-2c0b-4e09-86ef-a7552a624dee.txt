Pre-Operative/Clinical History Left renal mass. Specimen(s) Received A: MARGIN - BASE OF TUMOR, LEFT KIDNEY MASS B: LEFT RENAL MASS Gross Description Specimen A, received fresh.for frozen section labeled margin (base) of tumor, left kidney mass, consists of three friable tan soft tissue fragments that measure 0.2 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The fragments are entirely submitted for. frozen section in (A1 FS). Specimen B, received in formalin labeled left renal mass, consists of a 12 gm, 4.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm aggregate of multiple pink, friable to papillary soft tissue fragments admixed with a small amount of adipose tissue. Representative sections are submitted in (B1-6). ntraoperative Consultation Specimen A, frozen section diagnosis of "neoplasm present in one of three fragments' is rendered by. Microscopic Description Sections of the-first specimen reveal a fragment of adipose tissue, a fragment of benign renal parenchyma, and a single small fragment of papillary renal cell carcinoma, as described below.. Summary of Pathologic Findings  Renal Carcinoma Specimen B: Operative procedure: Enucleation; robotically-assisted laparoscopic left partial nephrectomy. Tumor size: The specimen was received morcellated and measured 4.0 x 4.0 x 2.5. cm in aggregate. Clinically, the tumor measured approximately 2.7 cm in maximum dimension. Laterality and focality: Left, unifocal. Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, type l. (The tumor demonstrates a papillary architecture with delicate fibrovascular cores lined by small cells with low grade nuclear features. Clusters of foamy histiocytes are present within Page 1 of 3

HISTOLOGY REPORT some of the cores. There is no evidence of necrosis or vascular invasion. The specimen contains small fragments of adjacent renal parenchyma.) Sarcomatoid features: Absent. Histologic grade:. Grade I. Extent of invasion: Cannot be determined. Lymph/vascular invasion: Cannot be determined. Margins: Cannot be assessed. Adrenal gland: Not submitted. Regional lymph nodes: Not submitted. Special studies:. The following immunostains are performed with the tumor cells staining as follows. Pax-8 Positive P504S Positive CK7  Positive CK20 Negative Vimentin Negative CD10 Negative TTF-1 Negative. These immunohistochemical features are compatible with a diagnosis of papillary renal cell carcinoma pTNM stage: The specimen was received morsellated, precluding an accurate pT'NM stage..Staging in this. case relies on the clinical imaging. Pathologic findings in nonneoplastic kidney: Insufficient.tissue. Diagnosis LEFT RENAL MASS, ROBOTICALLY-ASSISTED LAPAROSCOPIC LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY: LOW GRADE PAPILLARY RENAL CELL. CARCINOMA. Intradepartmental Consult Comment Positive and negative controls react satisfactorily Page 2 of 3
