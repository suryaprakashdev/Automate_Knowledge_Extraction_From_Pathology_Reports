"Sentinel node #1, hot (AFl-3)", received for frozen section are three lymph node candidates..  One lymph node is bisected and submitted for frozen section as AFl-AF2, and the remnant sections are submitted in blocks A1-2. Two additional lymph nodes are submitted for frozen section as AF3, and the remnant is submitted as block A3. B. "Axillary fat", received in formalin is a 11.3 x 4 x 1.5 cm fragment of yellow-tan adipose tissue which is dissected to reveal one lymph node candidate measuring 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm, which is submitted entirely in block B1. C. "Left breast cancer, two clips medial, one clip inferior, long stitch lateral, short stitch superior", received in formalin is a 8 cm medial to specimen inked as follows: superior-yellow, inferior-red, anterior-blue and. posterior-black. The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral to reveal a 2.0 x 1.5 x 1 cm mass lesion located 0.4 cm from the posterior margin, 0.7 cm from the anterior margin, 2.7 cm from the medial margin, 2.7 cm from the lateral margin, 1.3 cm from the superior margin and 3.2 cm from the superior margin. The remainder of the breast tissue demonstrates fibrofatty lobulated adipose tissue that is otherwise grossly unremarkable. Sections are submitted as follows per the block diagram: BLOCK SUMMARY: 1cD-o-3 carcinoma,inF1+aHng ducfa1NO5 C1- medial edge C2-4 representative medial breast 8soo/3 C5-28  mass submitted entirely Si+:brcast,N0S c5O.9 c29-31 representative lateral breast c32-34 lateral edge 7-Z-iz cD D. "Superior medial margin", received in formalin is a 7.2 x 6.4 x 2.3 cm fragment of adipose tissue with a stitch marking final margin. The final margin is inked blue and the opposite margin is inked black. Every other section is submitted in blocks Dl-10. E. "Medial and superior margin", received in formalin is a 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm fragment of yellow-tan adipose tissue with a stitch in place marking the final margin. The stitched margin is inked blue, and the opposite margin is inked black. The specimen is sectioned to reveal no focal lesions. Every other section is submitted in blocks E1-12. F. "Inferior to lateral margin", received in formalin is a 6.5 x 5.2 x 2.1 cm fragment of yellow-tan adipose tissue with a suture marking the final margin. The final margin is inked blue and the opposite margin is inked black. The specimen is sectioned to reveal no focal lesions. Every other section is submitted in blocks F1-11. G. "Anterior skin", received in formalin is a 7.5 x 5 x 2 cm unoriented aggregate of brown skin with subcutaneous tissue that is grossly unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in blocks G1-3. INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: "Sentinel node #1, hot and blue": A.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE: PRoceDuRe: Partial mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy. PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC) Edition): pT1c pNla(sn) pMX NoTe: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is. transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for accreditation by the Conmission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely. upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section, past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative. findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it. The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report. DIAGNOSIS: A. "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1" (BIOPSY) : METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN ONE OF THREE LYMPH NODES (1/3).
