Tumour size: 13.36 x 13.42mm (thickness 6.43)mm. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A fresh, intact, right globe.. Dimensions: Axial 25mm, Horizontal 25mm, Vertical 25mm Cornea: Horizontal 12.4mm, Vertical 12mm. ICD c:3 Optic nerve Length Smm, Diameter 4mm. Pupil: dilated JJ 6/3t/1y On trans-illumination, a shadow is seen posteriorly in the infero medial quadrant 12mm, query involvement of the disc. Plane of section: vertical. Intraocular description:. On opening, a solitary, dome shaped, pigmented tumour is seen involving the optic disc. Cut surface of optic nerve is dusky - ? infiltration with tumour.. Tumour size LBD 13mm, Height 6mm. MICROSCOPY Histologically, the enucleated eye demonstrates a normal anterior segment with an unremarkable cornea, a deep. anterior chamber and open angles. The iris leaves are unremarkable. The ciliary muscles are moderately atrophic. lens shows moderately advanced cataractous changes. Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified:

This is dome-shaped with a small accompanying exudative retinal detachment. The retina. overlying the tumour is atrophic with degenerative changes.. Focaliy, at the apex of the tumour, there is retinal invasion. The tumour is partially pigmented and consists predominantly of spindle cells. The melanoma cells are immunoreactive for MelanA, CD1l7 and HSp-27 (score 3). The number of mitoses is approx. 2/40 high power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is not prominent, and closed loops are not present in the tissue planes evaluated. Occasional  "vascular lakes" can be observed; in these tumour cells can be see located within the lumen. The lymphocytic. infiltrate within tumour is minimal. Macrophages are. scattered throughout the tumour in a mild density.There is no evidence of scleral invasion or of extraocular growth. The optic nerve is tumour free,. and demonstrates mild. atrophic changes. The examined vortex veins are free of tumour. FINAL DIAGNOSIS Choroidal melanoma of spindle cell type. COMMENT In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLpA). These investigations were. performed in the The kit p027 from  which examines for gains or. losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. The DNA concentration was measured using and the quality assessed using multiplex-pcR prior to the MLPA reaction. Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified:.

The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on differing occasions, resulting in similar results. The results of the sequence analysis of the MLpA products is printed on a separate report. In summary. sequence analysis demonstrated: normal chromosome 1, three borderline losses of chromosome 3, gains of chromosome 6. and gains in chromosome 8.. These molecular data require correlation with the clinical and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment. Reported: Pathologist: Electronically Verified: 3/4/1Y
