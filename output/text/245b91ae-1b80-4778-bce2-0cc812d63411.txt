Page 2 of 3 Synoptic Report SPECIMEN: Head of pancreas PROCEDURE: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple resection), partial pancreatectomy TUMOR SITE: Pancreatic head TUMOR SIZE: Greatest dimension: 3.7 cm Additional dimensions: 3.5 x 3.5 HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Ductal adenocarcinoma HISTOLOGIC GRADE: G1:  Well differentiated MICROSCOPIC TUMOR EXTENSION: Tumor invades peripancreatic soft tissues. Tumor invades retroperitoneal soft tissue  Tumor invades extrapancreatic common bile duct MARGINS: Margin(s) involved by invasive carcinoma Uncinate process (retroperitoneal) margin (nonperitonealized surface of the uncinate process) Common bile duct margin. TREATMENT EFFEcr (applicable to carcinomas treated with neoadjuvant therapy): No prior treatment LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Present PERINEURAL INVASION: Present PRIMARY TUMOR (pT): pT3: Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery REGIONAL LYMPH NODBS (pN) : Number examined: 24 Number involved: 10 DISTANT METASTASIS (pM) : Not applicable ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Chronic pancreatitis CLINICAL HISTORY: Not specified Gross Description Received are specimen containers A to E. 11 isitions and specimen containers are labelled with the patient's name,. The cassettes and identifiers are labelled with the Surgical Number The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin.. The A: container is designated "lymph node no 8" and contains a 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm firm tan yellow ovoid portion of tissue grossly consistent with a lymph node. On sectioning, the lymph node is firm, white, and grossly suspicious. The trisected lymph node is submitted entirely in Al and A2. B The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container is designated *portal lymph nodes" and contains an irregular heavily cauterized, 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm greyish tan tissue fragment. The fragment is bisected and submitted in toto in Bl.. C: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container is designated "gallbladder" and contains an intact unopened 6.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm gallbladder. The gallbladder serosa is smooth and shiny without nodules or adhesions,. and the adventitial surface is slightly roughened. The cystic duct is open. The cystic duct margin is inked black. A 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm plump ovoid cystic duct lymph node is. present.  The gallbladder lumen contains viscous green bile and no gallstones. The gallbladder wall is thin, pliable, and approximately 2 mm thick..  The galibladder mucosa is green and velvety with marked yellow speckling suggestive of cholesterolosis. There are no polyps, masses or other lesions.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1. bisected cystic duct lymph node and black - inked cystic duct margin C2. two representative sections of gallbladder mucosa, one from near gallbladder neck and one from fundus D: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container is designated "Whipple's specimen" and contains a 23 cm long portion of duodenum with attached 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of the pancreatic head.. The duodenum

--- Page 3 ---
Page 3 of 3 has an average linear circumference of 4 cm, and the distal 13 cm of the duodenum shows dusky ischemic discoloration. The duodenal mucosa has the normal pattern of folds, without polyps or other lesions.  The retroperitoneal margin (designated with a blue suture) is inked blue and the sMA groove is inked green, and the pancreatic neck margin is inked black. A portion of the pancreatic duct is identified at the pancreatic neck margin, but the duct appears occluded less than 1 cm from the margin. Replacing much of the head of the pancreas, there is an ill-defined roughly 3.7 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm firm rubbery tan white mass with infiltrative borders.  On sectioning, the central portion of the mass contains numerous cystic spaces filled with thin clear mucin. Grossly, the mass abuts the retroperitoneal margin and the smA groove but does not clearly involve those margins. The mass closely abuts the common bile duct, which contains a metal stent.  The mass also. Numerous lymph nodes are identified in the surrounding peripancreatic fat, a few of which are slightly enlarged and firm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: D1. proximal duodenal margin D2. distal duodenal margin D3. bile duct margin D4. tumor with pancreatic neck margin D5-7. three contiguous sections of tumor showing relationship of tumor with common bile duct and retroperitoneal margin D8. one lymph node bisected (represents the remainder of the lymph node previously sampled in b5), one additional possible lymph node inked blue and submitted whole D9. tumor with pancreatic margin D10. tumor with common bile duct and SMA groove D11. one peripancreatic lymph node trisected D12. section of tumor with bile duct D13. peripancreatic fat with possible lymph nodes D14. two lymph nodes (one node inked blue and bisected) D15. one node bisected D16. two lymph nodes (one node inked blue and trisected) D17. additional section of tumor with bile duct and ampulla D18-19. central portion of tumor with cystically dilated spaces filled with mucin D20. one lymph node trisected D21. two lymph nodes (one node bisected, one node inked blue submitted whole) D22-25. additional peripancreatic fat with possible lymph nodes E: The specimen consists of pink tan tissue measuring 2.2 x 1 x 0.3 cm.  Submitted in toto in E1. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container designated "pancreas neck". The previously frozen tissue is entirely resubmitted for permanent sections in EQsl. Frozen Section Diagnosis E: Pancreatic Neck: Chronic inflammation with some dilated ducts. No malignancy in the sampled sections. Reported by: Pathologist Comment E. Permanent sections of the pancreatic neck margin (i.e. slide E1-2) reveal rare crushed atypical cells, present in pools of mucin surrounding a nerve, highly suspicious for adenocarcinoma. These cells are not definitively identified in the original frozen section slides. Since the frozen section represents the "true" margin, and the permanent sections are cut from deeper (more distal) tissue, it is estimated that the true pancreatic neck margin is negative but that tumor extends very close (likely 1-2 mm) to this margin.
