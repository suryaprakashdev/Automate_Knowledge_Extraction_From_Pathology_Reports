LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. WLE VULVA Received is a vulvectomy specimen measuring 4 x 1.7 x 1 cm. The surface of the specimen is tan-gray and unremarkable. The single right stitch is arbitrarily designated 12 o'clock. The specimen is inked as. follows: 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock-blue, 6 o'clock, 9 o'clock, 12 o'clock-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from right to left and submitted in toto as follows: A1: 12 o'clock right margin A2-A4: full thickness sections from right to left A5: 6 o'clock left margin B. SLN #1: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.5cm. The specimen is bisected, touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in FSB. C. SLN #2: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3cm. The specimen is bisected, touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in C1.. D. SLN #3: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5cm. The specimen is bisected, touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in D1. E. SLN#4: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.5cm. The specimen is bisected, touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in E1. F. SLN#5: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.5cm. The specimen is bisected, touch preps.are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in F1. G. LEFtBREAST: Received fresh is a 474 gram simple mastectomy specimen measuring 21 x 19 x 3.5 cm. The specimen is partially surfaced with a tan-pink ellipse of skin measuring 16 x 16 cm. The skin surface is remarkable for a centrally located partially raised nipple 1 cm. The areola rim measures 1.3 cm. The specimen is inked as follows: superior anterior-blue, anterior inferior-orange, posterior-black. The. specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 10 slices; slice serially sectioned from medial to lateral in 10 slices; slice 1 the most medial, slice 10 the most lateral. The nipple is located in slice 5. and 6. The cut surface reveals a gray-white firm well circumscribed mass measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, Iocated in slice 5 and 6 and measuring 0.7 cm. from the closest deep margin. The mass is retroareolal measuring 2 cm. deep from the nipple. A second satellite nodule is identified in slice 8 measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm, 0.4 cm. from the deep margin and 5.5 cm. from nodule #1. A third possible satellite nodule is grossly identified in slice 7 measuring 0.4 cm. in greatest dimension, greater than 0.1 cm. from. the deep margin and 2.0 cm. from nodule #2 and 4 cm. from noduie #1. Nodule 2 and 3 are both Iocated in the lower outer quadrant. Remaining cut surfaces reveal predominantly yellow lobulated adipose tissue inrterdispersed with gray-white fibrous tissue. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows: G1: nipple serially sectioned slice 5. G2: nipple serially sectioned slice 6 G3: upper inner quadrant sice 3 G4: upper inner quadrant with deep margin slice 4 G5: lower inner quadrant slice 3

LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS: Received in formalin are multiple tan-pink fragments of fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 7 x 6 x 3 cm. Dissection reveals 15 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Section code: H1: Five possible lymph nodes H2: Five possible lymph nodes H3: Four possible lymph nodes H4: One lymph node serially sectioned. DIAGNOSIS: A.

- SIXTEEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/16). NOTE 1: Mild squamous dysplasia is present at the 12 o'clock-3 o'clock-6 o'clock margin in multiple. Ievels. Focally, this margin has cautery artifact which precludes the assessment of degree of dysplasia.. NOTE 2: Three foci of invasive ductal carcinoma are identified; largest measuring 1.8-cm is located centrally. The other two foci measure 1.0-cm and 0.4-cm respectively. All surgical resection margins are free of tumor. The closest margin is posterior (2.5 mm from the largest tumor mass) SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST Specimen Type: Mastectomy Needle Localization:  No Laterality:(Leff) Invasive Tumor: Present Multifocality: Yes WHO CLASSIFICATION Invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS 8500/3 Tumor size: 1.8cm Tumor Site:  Central.
