Patient: Case # FInAL SURGICAL PAThOLOgy REPORT Kidney;Lelt Clinical History/Operative Dx: Renal mass Gross Description:. The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received without fixative. It consists of a nephrectomy specimen which together perinephric fat weighs 627 grams. It measures 20 cm from superior to inferior, 10 cm from medial to lateral, and 9 cm from anterior to posterior. Along the anterior surface there is lobulated fatty tissue and there is a bulging fluctuant mass at the inferior pole of the kidney. At the hilum the renal artery and renal vein are identified. The vessels are opened and show no gross evidence of intraluminal tumor. Extending from the hilum of the kidney there is an 8 cm segment of ureter which appears somewhat attenuated. The ureter is opened to reveal smooth tan-white urothelium. The kidney is bivalved to reveal a fluid filled cystic mass in the inferior pole which bulges anteriorly this cystic mass measures 6 x 6 x 5.2 cm. It contains amorphous brown material and turbid fluid. The lining of the cyst is brown with patchy srnall areas of yellow discoloration. The cyst is 1.3 cm from the hilum of the kidney. It appears contained within the renal capsule and is separated from the anterior surface of the kidney by a thin layer of smooth fascial tissue. Representative sections of the mass are obtained for research purposes. The remaining.  kidney has pale red parenchyma and normal appearing medullary rays. Cortical thickness is 0.6 cm. There are scattered fluid filled cysts within the cortical portion of the kidney which are up to 1.3 cm. No other discrete masses are present. Serial sections of the perineural adipose tissue reveal no grossly obvious. Iymph nodes and no identifiable adrenal tissue. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: A1) surgical margin, renal artery, renal vein and ureter, A2) additional sections of ureter and ureteral pelvic junction, A3) anterior surface of lower pole kidney including possible Gerota's fascia, A4-A6) additional representative sections of cyst. A7) cyst and closest approach to hilum, A8) uninvolved kidney. Microscopic Description:.  Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered.
