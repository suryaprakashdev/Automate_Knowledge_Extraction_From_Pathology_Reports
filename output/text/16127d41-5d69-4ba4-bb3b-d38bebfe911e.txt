Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: E18 ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 PR: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) provided by Dako  ollowing the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunomsws..emical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS Specimen: Surgical Excision Block Number: E18 Interpretation: EQUIvOCAL Intensity: 2+ % Tumor Staining: 40% Fish Ordered: Yes , on Date METHODOLOGY:  Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and nn Ionaer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test L. I using rabbit anti- human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides proviaed oy the manufacturer (cell lines with high,. Iow and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from AScO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.. CLINICAL HISTORY: -year-old female with abnormal mammogram. The right breast upper outer quadrant 2.5-cm Mass appeared biopsy invasive lobular carcinoma.. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: E -- right breast wide local excision needle localization: Tumor is 1.7 cm located 1.3 cm from the nearest/lateral margin called by Dr to Dr. at ADDENDUM: The purpose of this addendum is to correct a typo found in the intraoperative consultation diagnosis area above reporting the results of the gross examination for the right breast wide local excision needle localization specimen and is as follows: PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ  hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17 signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene.

Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissueOutside Case No: NA Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.04 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free  and overall survival in stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu gene amplification status alone Overview of this test FDA APPROVED REAGENT PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of patients for whom Herceptin theraoy is beina considered. These tests were performed in the  under the direction ot Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
