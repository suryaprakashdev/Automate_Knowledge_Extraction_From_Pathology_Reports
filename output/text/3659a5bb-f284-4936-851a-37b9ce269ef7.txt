RIGHT COLON & TERMINAL ILEUM CLINICAL HISTORY: Colon ca. GROSS DESCRIPTION: RIGHT COLON AND TERMINAL ILEUM, RESECTION: A right hemicolectomy specimen comprised of cecum, ascending and transverse colon and appendix and short segment of terminal ileum. Colon measures 34 cm in length and with internal circumference of 7-9 cm. Short segment of terminal ileum measures 3.5 cm in length. Situtated 5.5 cm from the distal resected margin (transverse colon area) 32 cm from proximal margin is a fungating tumor that occupies 80% of the mucosal circumference. The tumor measures 5.5x3.5x1.0 cm. On sections, tumor grossly infiltrates muscle wall without gross extension to subserosal fat.. Remainder of colonic mucosa is grossly not remarkable. There is no identifiable polyps or diverticuli.. Cecum is not remarkable. Appendix measures 11 cm in length and external diameter of 0.5 cm. Grossly, appendix is not. remarkable Attached portion of omentum measures 8x7x0.9 cm. Cut section shows no indurated focus. Approximately 5 lymph nodes are dissected ranging in size from 0.1 cm to 1x0.5x0.6 cm. Multiple sections submitted as follows: A1-A5: tumor A6: proximal ileal margin A7; distal colonic margin A8: representative section of colonic mucosa distal to the tumor A9: representative section of colonic mucosa proximal to the tumor and ileocecal valve. A11: four lymph nodes from portion near tumor A12: four lymph nodes from portion near tumor A13: four lymph nodes from portion near tumor

A14: one serially sectioned lymph node from portion near tumor A15: five lymph nodes from middle portion of colon A16: five lymph nodes from middle portion of colon A17: one serially sectioned lymph node from middle portion of colon A18: five lymph nodes from ileocecal junction A19: six lymph nodes from ileocecal junction ADDENDUM: ANALYSIS OF MLH1 AND MSH2 PROTEIN EXPRESSION MLH1 Expression: Present MSH2 Expression: Present Tissue from this patient was retrieved from the archive and analyzed for these tumor markers.. Expression of MLH1 and MSH2 in the tumor was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Peritumoral lymphocytes serve as an internal positive control expressing both MLH1 and MSH2.. Testing for Microsatellite Instability has been ordered. The results will be issued in a separate report.
