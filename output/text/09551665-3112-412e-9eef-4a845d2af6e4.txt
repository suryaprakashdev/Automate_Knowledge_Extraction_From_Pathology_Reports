of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information. Comment: Immunostains were performed on block A2 and demonstrate the tumor is. positive for cDlo and c-kIr while being negative for cK7, Rcc, and. vimentin. A Hales colloidal iron shows patchy staining in tumor cells. Overall, these findings are most consistent with the chromophobe type of renal cell carcinoma.. Dr. has reviewed this case and concurs..

Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent Tumor site: superior pole; renal cortex. Tumor description: pink/tan, well circumscribed, with a single central cyst with a solid lining, and multiple areas of hemorrhage. Tumor size: 4.5 x 4.2 x 3.5 cm Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent Confinement/non-confinement to the kidney: confined. Extent of invasion:. Perirenal adipose tissue: does not involve
