PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: None provided. POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: None provided. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name. nd designated, "Right' Breast Sentinel Node #1" consists of three pink-tan lymph nodes measuring 0.3 cm, 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm, and 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning the larger lymph node reveals pink-red otherwise unremarkable parenchyma. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows: A1- one lymph node, bisected; A2- one lymph node; A3- one lymph node. A matched section of A2 is submitted in ocr for. protocol. Time in formalin: B: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated, "Right Breast Sentinel Node #2" consists of a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3. cm tan lymph node. The lymph node is bisected and submitted in its entirety. Time in formalin:. C: Received fresh, labelled with the patient's name and designated, "Right Breast Lumpectomy" consists of an ovoid portion of firm, yellow-tan breast tissue oriented with a short stitch-superior; and long stitch-lateral. The specimen measures 6.5 cm from superior to inferior; 5.5 cm from medial to lateral and 2.0 cm from anterior to deep. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-blue; inferior-green;. medial-red; lateral-yellow; anterior-orange; and deep-black. Serial sections reveal a firm, gritty, pink-tan mass measuring 4.0 x 3.5 x 1.5 Page 2 Continued on Next Page. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued) : cm. The mass show well defined borders along the superior portion of the specimen with patchy, ill defined distribution throughout the remainder of the specimen, involving approximately 75% of the cut surface. The mass. abuts the superior, anterior, deep, and medial margins. The surrounding breast tissue is dense, pink and white fibrous tissue. No other mass lesions are identified.  Representative sections are sequentially. submitted from superior to inferior as follows: C1-c2- mass with superior margin; c3-c5- mass with additional margins; C6- adjacent normal; c7- mass with additional margins; c8- mass with additional margins; c9- mass with lateral margin; c1o- mass with additional margins; c1i- mass with additional margins; C12- inferior margin. Matched sections of c3,c5,c7, and c9-c11 are submitted in Ocr and paraffin for ' protocol.
