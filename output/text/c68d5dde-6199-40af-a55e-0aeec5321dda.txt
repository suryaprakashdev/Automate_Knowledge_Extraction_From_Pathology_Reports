COMMENT Part # 1, # 2, # 3, # 4, and # 5: The results of immunohistochemical stainings support the above diagnosis (see microscopic description). Parts #1, #2 and #3: The metastatic tumor cells with thin these lymph nodes are depicted by the AE1/AE3 cytokeratin immunostaining and are present circumferentially within the sub capsular sinusoidal area in minute tumor cell clusters and mostly as single cells. Re- review of the imprint slides performed at intraoperative consultation showed no metastatic tumor cells in part 1 and part 2, and showed rare atypical cells in part 3.. GROSS DESCRIPTION The specimen is received fresh and in 5 parts. Part 1 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials  and "sentinel node biopsy #1 left axilla, not blue". It consists of a portion of  adipose tissue which measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node. is identified measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch preparation to reveal a homogenous tan-yellow cut surface. The lymph node is further bisected longitudinally into 2-mm intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled

1A-1B. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours Part 2 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials T and "sentinel node biopsy #2 left axilla. not blue". It consists of a single fatty pink. tan probable lymph node with minimal attached adipose tissue which measures 2 x 1.7 x 1 cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch preparation analysis to reveal a largely fatty replaced cut surface. The lymph node halves are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled 2A-2B.. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours Part 3 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials . and "sentinel node biopsy #3 ieft axilla ...- not blue'. It consists of a portion of  adipose tissue which measures 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm. A single fatty pink tan probable lymph node is identified measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected to reveal a largely fatty replaced cut surface. One half the lymph node is submitted for frozen section  analysis. Both halves of the lymph node are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal intervals and submitted entirely as follows:. 3FS- lymph node half, frozen section. 3A- remaining lymph node halves. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials I and *sentinel node biopsy #4 left axilla not blue'. It consists of a portion of adipose tissue which measures 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node is identified measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm. The lymph node is bisected to reveal a pink-tan cut surface interspersed with adipose tissue. The lymph node halves are further sectioned into 2-mm longitudinal intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled 4A-48. Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials  and *left total mastectomy long lateral short superior". It consists of a 1202 g total mastectomy specimen which measures 23.5 x 22 x 7.5 cm. The anterior surface is remarkable for an ellipse shaped portion.of light tan skin which measures 20 x 16 cm. The areola measures 6.5 x 6 cm with a 1.1-cm retracted, mobile nipple. No discrete skin scars or lesions are grossly identified. The  specimen is inked and sectioned to reveal a large, ill-defined stightly stellate mass (ring. shaped biopsy clip) which is located roughly between the upper outer and lower outer quadrants, and extends towards the central aspect of the breast. The mass measures 8.0 x 6.5 x 4.2 cm and comes to within 1.0 cm of the closest posterior margin, 2.2 cm of the skin and 3 cm of the anterior inked margin. The breast parenchyma directly medial of the mass and encompassing a large portion of the upper inner and lower inner quadrants is dense and extensively fibrocystic (approximately 10 x 4.5 x 4 cm). No additional masses are identified grossly. The uninvolved breast parenchyma is composed of approximately 50% adipose tissue and 50% nodular fibrous tissue. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 5A- nipple and subareolar soft tissue 5B- breast parenchyma directly lateral of mass. 5C- fullface mass (most lateral aspect) 5D-5K- fullface mass (central lateral aspect), 5D-5G- posterior aspect, 5E-5K= anterior aspect 5L-5S- fullface mass (central medial aspect), 5L-5O= posterlor aspect, 5P-5S= anterior aspect 5T-5U- fullface mass (most medial aspect). 5V- breast parenchyma directly medial of mass. 5W-5Y- fibrocystic tissue adjacent to the mass

Cold ischemic time: 28 minutes Formalin exposure time: 12 hours 30 minutes MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Microscopic examination substantiates the above dlagnosis.. The results of immunohistochemical staining are as follows for Part 1, 2, 3, and 4: Antibody/Antigen Result AE1-AE3 Positive in the metastatic tumor cells in parts1, 2 & 3, negative in 4. The results of immunohistochemical staining are as follows for Part 5: Antibody/Antigen Result E-Cadherin Negative P120 Positive cytoplasmic expression in lobular cells D240 Highlights lymphatic spaces; no tumor cells within lymphatic. spaces. CD31 Highlights vascular c spaces; no tumor cells within vascular. spaces. Utilizing formalin-fixed (8-96 hour range), paraffin embedded tissue, immunohistology is pertormed with the following selected antibodies and designated antibody clone(s), directed against the tollowing antigenic target(s), with adequate positive and negative internal and external controls. Antibodies are optimized appropriate for fixation times.
