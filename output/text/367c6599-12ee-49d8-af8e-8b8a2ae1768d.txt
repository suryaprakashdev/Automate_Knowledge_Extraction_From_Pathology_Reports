LEFT BREAST LATERAL NEEDLE LOCALIZATION GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh are 4 tan pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.5cm to 1.5cm in greatest dimensions. Four. touch preps are taken. A1: 1 lymph node A2: 1 lymph node A3: 1 lymph node A4: 1 lymph node B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA Received fresh are 2 tan pink lymph nodes 0.5cm and 1.2cm in greatest dimensions. Two touch preps. are taken. B1: 1 lymph node B2: 1 lymph node C. LEFT BREAST MEDIAL NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast medial needle localization" is an oriented 38g, 8 x 5 x 2.2cm needle localized lumpectomy. Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black,. superior-blue, inferior-orange, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 6 slices revealing a 1.3 x 1.3 x 1.2cm tan pink well circumscribed firm mass, closest to the posterior margin at 0.1cm and 0.2cm from the anterior margin in slices 3-4. Tissue is procured.. Representatively submitted: C1-C2: medial margin slice 1 C3-C6: slice 2 C7-C10: slice 3 with mass in C9 C11-C15: slice 4 with mass in C13 C16-C19: slice 5 C20-C23: lateral margin slice 6 D. LEFT BREAST LATERAL NEEDLE LOCALIZATION Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast lateral needle localization" is an. oriented 11g, 4.5 x 3.5 x 2cm needle localized lumpectomy. Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-blue, inferior-orange, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 6 slices revealing a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4cm tan pink well circumscribed firm mass, closest to the inferior margin at 0.5cm in slice 3. Entirely submitted: D1: medial margin slice 1 D2-D3: slice 2 D4-D5: slice 3 with mass in D5 D6-D7: slice 4 D8: slice 5  D9: lateral margin slice 6 DIAGNOSIS: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 1, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY: - MICROMETASTATIC CARCINOMA IN ONE OF FOUR LYMPH NODES (1/4) - NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION IS SEEN. NOTE: Several foci of tumor are seen in one lymph node with the largest measuring 0.5 millimeters. A. cytokeratin AE1/3 stain is positive in tumor cells. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 2, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY: - TWO LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/2).
