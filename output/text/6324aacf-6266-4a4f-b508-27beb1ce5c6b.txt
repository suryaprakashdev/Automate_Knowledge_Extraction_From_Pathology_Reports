microscopic section, in the "Breast Carcinoma Checklist." The Diagnosis above is unchanged, and is correct, with a total of 2 positive nodes; that count has been re-verified by review of the microscopic slides. The microscopic checklist section has now been corrected, to indicate that a total of 2 nodes are positive. The "N" stage has thus been corrected to pN1, as well. This case was discussed with at a recent conference, and he in fact pointed out this discrepancy. I informed him at that time that I would make these corrections to the report. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a  year-old woman with biopsy proven infiltrating Iobular cancer of the left breast (ER+ PR+ Her2/neu-). Operative procedure: Sentinel lymph node biopsies, left modified radical mastectomy and right simple mastectomy. GROSS: Received are four fresh containers each labeled with the patient's name A. The first container is additionally labeled "A - left sentinel lymph node #1." The specimen consists of a 2.1 x 2.06 cm fragment of pale, yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue. A single potential Iymph node is identified measuring 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted for frozen section analysis as AFS1.

B. The next container is labeled "B - left sentinel lymph node #2." The specimen consists of a 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm fragment of yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue. Two potential lymph nodes are identified measuring 0.8 x 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The smaller node is inked black. The nodes are serially sectioned and entirely submitted for frozen section analysis as BFs1. The remaining adipose tissue is submitted for permanent sections in cassette B2. Summary of Sections: BFS1 - two potential sentinel lymph nodes, entirely submitted. B2 - remaining soft tissue.. C. The next container is labeled "C - left breast at 12 o'clock with left axillary node dissection." The specimen consists of a 613 gm modified radical mastectomy with axillary tail. The breast measures 17 cm medial to lateral, 15.5 cm superior to inferior and 3.9 cm superficial to deep. The attached axillary tail measures 8 x 7.5 x 2 cm. There is an attached ovoid portion of skin measuring 4 x 3.5 cm with an everted, freely mobile nipple which measures 2.5 x 2.5 cm with the areolar complex. The deep fascial plane is inked black, the  remaining superior half is inked blue with the remaining inferior half inked green. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral. A gray-white, firm, irregularly-bordered mass is identified in the upper outer quadrant measuring 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.3 cm in greatest dimension.

--- Page 5 ---
This mass is consistent with a bilobed single mass. However, it could represent two separate masses. The central area of the mass is submitted which could represent normal parenchyma in between the two masses. The mass is 1.8 cm to the deep margin and 2.5 cm to the nipple. A dumbbell-shaped biopsy clip is identified near the medial portion of the mass. There are firm, indurated possibly calcified areas located posteriorly to the nipple. The axillary tail is dissected to reveal 19 potential lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 to 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted. The specimen is sectioned and laced in formalin. Summary of Sections: C1 - middle portion of mass. c2-C3 - medical portion of tumor. C4 - lateral portion of tumor with deep margin. C5 - lateral portion of tumor. C6 - representative upper inner quadrant. C7 - representative upper outer quadrant. C8 - representative lower outer quadrant. c9 - representative lower inner quadrant. C10 - representative retroareolar areas of induration. C11 - nipple. c12 - one potential lymph node, bisected, entirely submitted. c13 - one potential lymph node, bisected, entirely submitted. C14 - one potential lymph node, bisected, entirely submitted.

C15 - six potential lymph nodes, submitted intact. C16 - six potential lymph nodes, submitted intact. C17 - four potential lymph nodes, submitted intact. D. The next container is additionally labeled "D - right breast." The specimen consists of a 510 gm simple mastectomy measuring 20 x 17 x 2.8 cm. Attached roughly ovoid portion of skin measures 3.9 x 2.5 cm which is pale tan without lesions identified. The attached nippie is everted and freely mobile and measures 2.7 x 2.0 cm with the areolar complex. The deep fascial plane is inked black. The remaining specimen is inked blue. The specimen is unoriented. It is serially sectioned to reveal yellow-tan, lobulated parenchyma with interspersed, dense and gray-white fibrosis and fibrocystic change. A small 0.6 cm area of hemorrhage is identified located at the periphery. Masses or lesions suspicious for malignant process are not grossly identified. The specimen is arbitrarily divided into quadrants and representative sections are submitted. The specimen is sectioned and placed in formalin . Summary of Sections: D1 - nipple. D2-D3 - representative of quadrant 1. D4-D5 - representative of quadrant 2. D6-D7 - representative of quadrant 3. D8-D9 - representative of quadrant 4.
