CL InflrnatNg duct, N05 8500J 3 Carcnoa. i Patient history: Site Code: Draot. Nos 650.9 The patient is a *. -year-oid female with no clinical history or.LMP given.. PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Right breast CA. UUID: 38FF655E-47AB-4880-8119-1402A335126A POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same. TCGA-BH-A18T-01A-PR Redacted PROCEDURE: Right segmental mastectomy, sentinel node. ADDENDA: Addendum ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE AND HER-2/NEU REPORT Using appropriate positive and negative controls, the test for the presence of these hormone receptor proteins is performed by the immunoperoxidase method. and reported according to the consensus statement on adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, of. A positive ER or PR tumor shows any nuclear immunostaining, and is semiquantitated as indicated below. Resuit Semiquantitative Statement ER negative Percent cells staining as: (0 100%). PR negative Percent cells staining as: (0 100%). HER-2/neU DAKO hErCEpTeSt: A wEaK tO mODErAtE COmpLeTe mEmBrANe STainIng iS ObSErVED In mORe THAN 10% OF THE TUMOR CELLS. HER-2INEU IS INTERPRETED AS WEAKLY POSITIVE (SCORE 2+). NOTE: Her-2/Neu FISH was ordered and will be subsequently reported. The Her-2/neu and estrogen/progesterone receptor assays were performed with FDA approved methods. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Part 1: breast, right, segmental mastectomy -- INFILTRATiNg DUCTAL CARCINOmA, 3.1 Cm, pOORLy DIFFEREnTiATED, nOTTIngHAm SCORE = 9/9 7tuBuLes = 3, nuclear graDe = 3, mitoses = 3). B. LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. SEpaRAte fOcI Of Ductal CaRcinoma In SITU, SOLiD Type, high nuCLEaR graDE. THE DUCTAL CARCINOMA iN SITU EXTENDS CLOSE (< 0.1 CM) TO THE POSTERIOR SURGICAL MARGIN Of recection. E. All surgiCal margins Of resection are free Of tumor. F.  NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST WITH FIBROCYTIC CHANGES. Part 2: sentinel Lymph node #1, right axillA, Biopsy -- ONE (1) LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1), (see comment). Part 3: sentinel Lymph node #2, right AxillA, biOpsy -- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR, (0/1).(see comment). Part 4: non-sentinel Lymph node, right axilla, biopsy - One Lymph nOde, nEgative fOR tumor, (0/1). COMMENT: Cytokeratin (AEt/3) stains have been performed and confirm the negative status of the sentinal lymph nodes.
