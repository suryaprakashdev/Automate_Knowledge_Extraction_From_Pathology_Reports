Overall the dimensions of the specimen measure 22 x 15 x 1l cm. The kidney proper measures 15 x 10.5 x 6.5 cm. The ureter is identified at the hilum measuring 1.0 cm. The remainder of the vessels. at the hilum are identified with clamps. The attached adrenal gland has a somewhat disrupted appearance measuring 5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The cut surface of the. adrenal gland has a gold-yellow appearance. The kidney is bivalved and in the  upper pole the cut surface reveals a capsulated necrotic mass 9 x  9 x 6 cm and grossly appears to push the capsule in the area of the mass. The cortex in the lower pole has a tan smooth appearance measuring 1.1 cm. The mass measures to the Up junction 2.9 cm. Further serially sectioning the mass has a very friable necrotic hemorrhagic appearance. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 = left ureter remainder of vessels at. hilum; A3-A4 full thickness cross sections of  attached adrenal gland; A5-A6 full thickness cross sections of Up junction;. A7-A9 full thickness  cross sections  demonstrating mass, capsule  and and fatty tissue; A10-A12 = full thickness cross sections  of parenchyma lower pole that is not involved. Also was taken research. Additional section code:. A13-Al6= full thickness cross sections  of tumor to kidney and Pre
