The adventitia is. red-tan and unremarkable. The esophageal mucosa is gray-tan and predominantly folded. At the. gastroesophageal gastric junction a focal area of granular tissue is identitied. Underlying the esophagogastric junction an ill-detined 7.2 x 1.3 x 0.3 cm annular tumor is identified at the cardia of the stomach. There is possible some extension into the esophagus. The tunor is 5.5 cm away trom the proximal margin and 1.8 cm away fron the distal margin, tan-gray and granular. The distal margin is inked blue, the adventitia is inked black. Tunor has a maximun depth of 0.7 cm and extends to paraesophageal fat. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified ranging up to 1.2 cm.. 1A. Proximal margin, shave and submitted for frozen section.
