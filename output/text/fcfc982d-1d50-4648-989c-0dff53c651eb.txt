Case # FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT  measures 15.5 cn trom medial to lateral, 14.8 cm froin superior to inierior, and 4.3 cm frgm superficial to  deep. There is an overlying 16 x 10 cm skin ellipse with a sharply delineated 3 cm areola and protuberant 1 cm nipple. The skin shows muitiple punctate areas of pale red discoloration which are 1 mm to 1.5 mm. No other skin lesions are identified. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior nargin  is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth fascial tissue. is inked black. The breast. is serialy sectioned at close intervals to reveal lobutated fatty tissue and scattered tan-white tibrous to finely nodular breast parenchyma. There are no areas which have a stellate or retracted eppearance suggestive of neoplasm.No lyrnph nodes are identified within the lateral portion of tne bjeast Representative sections are submitted.

The specimen is labeled left axillary sentinei lymph node # consists of a 8 x 8 x 6 mn lymph node. The lymph node is serially sectioned at ciose intervals and louch imprints are obtained. The node is submitted tor permanent section in cassette D1.1 E. The specimen is labeled left breast and is received without fixative. It consisls of a mastectomy  specimen weighing 445 grams. A black suture marks the tail of the breast. With this orientation the  specimen measures 19 cm trom medial to lateral, 14.5 cm superior to inferior, and 4.2 cm from superticial to deep. There is an overlying 18 x 10.8 cm ellipse of pink-tan skin with a central inferiony located snarply circumscribed 3.5 cm areola and 0.9 cm protuberant tan nipple. The skin shows a few tiny punctate areas  of red discoloration which are up to 1.5 mm in maximum dinension. No other skin lesions are present. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists of smooth tascial tissue, is inked black. The breast is serially sedioned to reveal a stellate retracted neoplasm in the central breast underying the nipple and superior areoja. This neoplasm measures 5 cm trom medial to lateral, 2.5 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.8 cm fromsuperticial to deep. It is 4.5 cn from the closest superior margin, 4.5 cm from the closest inferior margin, 7 cm from the closest lateral margin, 6.5 cn from the closest medial rnargin, and 1.7 cm from the closest deep margin. It. is 2 cn from the closest skin. Representative tissue from the neoplasm is obtained for research purposes. The remainder of the breast is composed of lobulated fatty tissue with scattered tan-whte tibrous. Page4 Case # Ths report continues..
