UUID:FAB79463-7351-4C25-9AEC-7B47486C7F54 TCGA-4T-AA8H-01A-PR Redacted Results Surgical Pathology TOD O3 Result Data ACCESSION Site: Cwecenolirg colon C18.6 Q i|13|i4 Entry Date Component Results Component Lab Clinical History Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon.. Gross Examination A. "Left paratubal cyst with left tubal fimbria". Received fresh and placed. in formalin atj is a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm fragment of fimbria with attached 3.5 x 3.0 3.0 cm paratubal cyst. The cyst is unilocular and filled with clear serous fluid. The cyst wall is less than 0.1 cm thick and has a smooth internal lining. Representative sections are submitted as follows: BLOCK SUMMARY: A1- fimbriated end, bisected A2- representative sections of cyst wall. A3-9 remainder of specimen B. "Descending and siqmoid colon, stitch marks distal". received and placed in formalin on Specimen received: Descending colon and sigmoid colon. Colon length: 21.5 cm. Tumor location: Descending colon. Tumor dimensions: 5.2 x 4.7 x 1.2 cm Tumor appearance: Exophytic, lobulated, and focally friable. On cut surface, the mass displays elongated cystic spaces within. the bowel wall which are filled with friable tumor material. Distance from margins: Proximal: 2.8 cm. Distal: 13.5 cm. Mesenteric: 2.0 cm. Bowel circumference at tumor site: 7.2 cm. -  growth: 75%. Depth of invasion: 2.2 cm. Deepest invasion: The mass invades through the bowel wall, into the fat and. puckers the underlying serosa (inked blue). Tumor perforation: No. Involvement of adjacent structures: No. Mesentery dimensions: 20.0 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm Serosa: The serosa is focally puckered underlying the mass (blue ink). The puckering comes within 3.5 cm of the proximal margin. Lymph nodes: Multiple lymph nodes are identified, up to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. Page I of 4

Secondary findings: The remainder of the bowel mucosa is tan, velvety, with normal folding pattern. There is focal submucosal tattooing, 2.5 cm proximal to the mass. Special studies prospectively ordered: No Yes. Photograph: Block diagram: No. Tissue submitted for research: Yes, tumor and normal. BLOCK SUMMARY: B1-B2- proximal margin B3-B4- distal margin B5- mass, deepest invasion with serosal puckering B6-B10- additional sections of mass B11- mass to closest mesenteric margin B12- representative normal colon with tattoo. B13- six lymph nodes B14 six lymph nodes B15- four lymph nodes B16-- four lymph nodes B17- four lymph nodes B18- four lymph nodes B19- one lymph node, bisected. B20- one lymph node bisected Microscopic Examination Microscopic examination is performed. Within part A, the fallopian tube fimbria demonstrates a focal area of mild cytologic atypia. Immunohistochemistry of this area (block Al) reveals weak/low cytokeratin 7, p53 and Ki67 expression. Cytokeratin 20, Pax8 and cdx2 are negative. In comparison, the tumor present in the colon demonstrates strong cytokeratin 20 and cbx2 expression and is negative for Pax8, p53, and cytokeratin 7. Ki67 is moderately elevated. Overall, the findings in the fallopian tube are felt to be secondary to cautery artifact. Dr.. has reviewed parts of this case. and concurs with the interpretation.. Immunohistochemical Findings The immunoperoxidase tests reported herein were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Some of them may not be cleared or approvea by the U.s.
