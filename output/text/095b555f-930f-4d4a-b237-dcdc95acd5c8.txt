PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu is an FDA-approved rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (clone 435) directed against the internal domain of the c-erbb-2 oncoprotein (Her2) for imminohistochemical detection of Her2 protein overexpression in breast cancer tissue routinely processed for histologic evaluation. The HBR2 test results are reported in accordance with the Asco/CAP guideline recommendations for HeR2 testing in breast cancer (J clin Oncol 2007; 25(1):118-145). The ER and PR rabbit monoclonal antibodies are also FDA approved. 4. BREAST, LEFT, SUPERIOR MARGIN; EXCISION: - BENIGN BREAST TISSUE WITH PROLIFERATIVE FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES.
