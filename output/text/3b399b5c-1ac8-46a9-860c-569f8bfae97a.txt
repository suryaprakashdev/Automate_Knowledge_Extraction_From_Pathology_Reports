DIAGNOSIS: Kidney, right, partial nephrectomy: 1. Renal cell carcinoma with papillary features, suggestive of papillary Type i.. Capsule is free of tumor. Chronic interstitial nephritis, occasional incipient lesion present 2. Adipose tissue, over tumor, excision: Cluster of tumor cells and fat, see Note. 3. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Chronic cholecystitis. NOtE: The group of tumor cells present in the fat appears to be floaters or contamination. Staining for CK7 is strongly positive.

"Renal mass deep margin ink" is a red-tan soft tissue mass with one surface inked in black measuring 5.2 x 3.4 x 3 cm. The remainder of specimen is inked in green in the frozen section room. The specimen is cut to reveal a tan solid tumor measruing 4.3 x 2.2 cm with a central area of hemorrhage and necrosis. There is a rim of normal renal parenchyma on one side measuring up to 0.6 cm. Approximately 0.6 x 0.6 Lab on by  in the  the specimen matches the above description. The tumor can be grossly noted and it appears to be at the previously inked blue margin. Representative sections are submitted in white cassettes labeled. 1A-1H as follows: 1A-1C - tumor and closest resection margin inked in blue; 1D-1G -- tumor and papillary aspect; 1H -- normal renal parenchyma.

2.  "Fat over tumor, outer margin". It consists of multiple yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring in aggregate 4.2 x 3.5 x 0.6 cm. A smaller tan piece measuring 1.3 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm presenting small papillae can be grossly noted. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a small area of hemorrhage and a similar papillary tan structure. The specimen is entirely submitted in white cassette labeled 2A-2F. 3. "Gallbladder".It consists of a 9.8 x 3.6 x 2.8-cm gallbladder specimen.The serosal surface is unremarkable. The specimen is open to reveal a red-tan mucosa surface and approximately 10 ml of green/brown bile. No gallstones are identified. Approximately 1 x 1 x 0.2 cm of tissue is procured for Lab and 1 x 1 x 0.2 cm for the The procurement was performed by on 03/01/10 at 2:15 p.m.In the the specimen matches the above description. The mucosa appears green and velvety with a maximum thickness of O.5 cm. The bile duct is probed. It measures 0.3 cm in maximal diameter. Representative sections are submitted in 2 white cassettes labeled 3A and 3B (3A - bile duct and vascular margin; 3B - representative section of gallbladder).
