CQcF : 5rusF,Nos c50.9 POST OP DIAGNOSIS: Same. UUID: 2616F70D-3E15-45BA-8907-65694595F7260 TCGA-BH-A18U-01A-PR Redacted PROCEDURE: Sentinel node biopsy, total mastectomy. ADDENDA: Addendum ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE AND HER-2INEU REPORT Using appropriate positive and negative controls, the test for the presence of these hormone receptor proteins is  performed by the immunoperoxidase method, and reported according to the N!H consensus statement on adjuvant. therapy for breast cancer, ot A positive ER or PR tumor shows any nuclear immunostaining, and is.  semiquantitated as Indicated below. Result Semiquantitative Statement ER positive Percent cells staining as: (0 20%; 1+ 30%, 2+ 30%, 3+ 20%) PR positive Percent cells staining as: (0 70%, 1+ 10%, 2+ 10%, 3+ 10%) HER-2/NeU DAKO hERCePTESt: A STrONG COMPLETE mEmBrANE STAINING IS OBSERVED IN MORe ThAN 10% OF THE TUMOR CELLS. HER-2IneU IS inTeRPReTED AS STRONGly POSITIVE (SCORE 3+). FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Part 1: Left Breast, tOtal mastectomy -  InFILTRATing Quct.CARcINOmA, TWQ LeSiONS, 2.6 X 1.7 X 1.5 Cm in The LOWER OUteR QUADRant ) :AND 3.0 X 2.8 X 2.5 Cm IN THE uppER OUTER QUADRAnT. nOTTInGhAm SCORE 9 OUt OF 9 (TuBuLES 3, NUClEI 3, MITOSiS 3). B.  LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED. C. DUCtAL CARCinOmA IN-SiTU, SOLID TYPE, nUCLEAR GRADE 3 WITH COmeDO-TYPE NECROSiS, COMPRISINg LeSS THaN 5% Of tUmOR. D.  SURGICAL MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR INFILTRATING DUCT CARCINOMA AND DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN-E SItU. E.  INFILTRATING DUCT CARCINOMA FOCALLY APPROACHES VERY CLOSELY MARGIN OF EXCISION INS The Lower Outer Quadrant (within o.2 cm). . F.  NIpple negative for tumor. G.  Changes consistent with previous core biopsy site.  TWO LYMPH NODES, POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (2 OUT OF 2). H. PARt 2: LEft BREASt, nEW AnTeRIOR-InfERiOR MArGin, EXCISiON --  SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. PArt 3: Left Sentinel Lymph nODe #1, BiOpSy - ONE LymPH nODE POSITIVE fOR METASTATIC CARCInOmA (1 OUT OF 1). PART 4: LEFT SENTiNEL LyMPH NODE #2, BIOPSY - One Lymph nODe nEgaTIve fOR metaStatiC CARcinOmA (0 Out Of 1). Part 5: Left sentinel Lymph node #3, Biopsy -  One Lymph nODE pOsitIvE fOr metAstatIc CarcINoma (1 Out Of 1). Part 6: Left AxIlLary COntents, excIsiOn -- FIVE OF ELEVEN LyMPH NODeS POSITIVE fOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA, THREE WITH EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION. PART 7: RIGHT BREAST TISSUE, EXCISION (396 GRAMS) - A.  FOCAL ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA ASSOCIATED WITH MICROCALCIFICATIONS B. CALCIFIED FIBROADENOMA. C. FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH MICROCALCIFiCATIONS. SCLEROSING ADENOSIS. D Criteria E. SCLEROSING INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA. UNREMARKA8LE SKIN. COMMENT: Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2/neu immunostains will be ordered and subsequently reported in an addendum. Immunostaining for e-cadherin and myosin heavy chain confirm the interpretation of changes in the right breast tissue.
