A1: one lymph node A2: one lymph node A3: one lymph node B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 RIGHT BREAST Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is sectioned. A touch prep is taken. Toto B1. C. RIGHT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated *right breast" is a 110 g, 13 x 10 x 3.5 cm, oriented (suture in axilla), mastectomy with pink-tan 10.5 x 5.4 cm skin ellipse with 3.2 cm linear scar and everted 0.8 cm diameter nippie. Ink code: Posterior-black, anterior/superior-blue, anterior/inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 9 slices revealing a hemorrhagic firm biopsy cavity, 2.5 x 2 x 1.6 cm (slices 5-6) at 12:00, 0.1 cm from the deep margin and 0.2 cm from anterior (superior). Located adjacent and superior to the biopsy cavity (12:00, slices 5- 6) is an 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm ill-defined firm lesion that is 0.1 cm from the anterior margin and 0.3 cm from. the deep margin.
