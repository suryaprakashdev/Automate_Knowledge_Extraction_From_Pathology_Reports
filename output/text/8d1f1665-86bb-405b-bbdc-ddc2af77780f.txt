Extension into renal vein: Not grossly apparent. Extension into collecting system: Not grossly apparent.. Adrenal gland: Absent. Gross notes:. Gross tumor characteristics: Tan-yellow, centrally hemorrhagic,. well-demarcated, solid mass with diffusely soft cut surfaces. Kidney weight: 43 g. Kidney dimensions: 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. Distance to margin: The tumor grossly appears to abut the inked parenchymal margin. Lymph nodes: Absent. Inking details: The parenchymal resection margin is inked black. and the margin is designated by the surgeon. Biorepository sample submitted: Yes, see block key. Other: Representative sections from the cut surface of the tumor. are submitted for frozen section in one block. Block key for specimen A: A1) Representative sections from cut surface of tumor, submitted for frozen section. A2-A4) Additional sections of tumor in relation to inked parenchymal margin. A5) Mirror image of tissue submitted for IRB study A6) Section of tumor in relation to outermost surface (renal capsule).
