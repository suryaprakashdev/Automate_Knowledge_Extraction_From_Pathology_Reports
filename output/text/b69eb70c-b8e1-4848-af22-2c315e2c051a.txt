There is Page 6 of 11

--- Page 7 ---
D - Sections show urothelial carcinoma, high grade (transitional cell carcinoma grade 3/3). The tumor shows a solid growth pattern. There is minimal papillary formation. The tumor invades into the inner half of the muscularis propria. There are many areas of lymphovascular invasion wirhin the cumor mass, at the from the main tumor mass. There is no obvious perineural invasion. The surgical margins (right and left ureral, urethral and soft tissue margins) are free of tumor involvement. The urothelium adjacent to the invasive carcinoma show high grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ. The urothelium away from the main tumor shows several changes including reactive atypia, low grade dysplasia. high grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ. Brunner's nests with high grade dysplasia/ carcinoma in situ are present. Several arean of the urothelium are lost. The mucosa shows a few granulomas with multinucleated giant cells. There is also tibrosis, acute and chronic inflammation of the mucosal portion not involved by tumor tissue.. Sections of the right and left ureters show focal areas of high grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ. E - Sections show ten lymph nodes. One of them show a microscopic focus of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma. F - Sections show eleven lymph nodes, two of them show metastatic carcinoma.  The maximum size of the metastases are about 3 mm in lymph Jodes meauring up to 3.5 mm and 6 mm, respectively. G - Sections show eleven lymph nodes without metastatic carcinoma. H - Sections show six lymph nodes without metastatic carcinoma. I - Sections show six lymph nodes without metastatic carcinoma. J - Sections show two lymph nodes without metastatic carcinoma. K - Sections show one lymph node without metastatic carcinoma L - Sections show terminal ileal wall with no diagnostics alteration. M - Sections show cross sections of ureter with no dysplasia or carcinoma invasive. N - Sections show cross section of ureter with focal low grade dysplaaia. High grade dysplasia or carcinoma is not identified. Page 7 of 11

DATE OF DISCHARGE DOCTOR: DATE OF SERVICE: Pathology Consultation Report Supplemental CASE: REASON FOR ADDENDUM: Addendum issued to repot findings of gross and microscopic examination of prostate following formalin fixation and whole-mount processing. ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY DIAGNOSIS: Prostate, radical cystoprostatectomy. Focal invasive urothelial carcinoma into prostatic stroma Extensive urothelial carcinoma in-situ involving prostate, with prostatic duct and acinar involvement. Urathelial carcinoma in situ involving ejaculatory duct and seminal vesicle No lymphovascular invasion seen. No prostate adenocarcinoma  Margins negative for urothelial carcinoma. PATHOLOGIST: I have reviewed this material and confirm the report. Released by electronic signature on: MATERIAL: O. Prostate.. HISTORY: with bladder cancer. GROSS: O. Received in formalin.and labeled prostate is a prostate with attached bilateral seminal vesicles which tagether weigh 94g. The. prostate itself weighs 64g, and measures 4.5cm inferior to superior;. 6.0cm transversely; and 6.Ocm anterior to posterior. Page 9 of 11.

Following formalin fixation. the prostate margins are inked: the right side in black, the left eide in blue. Cut surfaces of nonsurgical margins are inked as orange. The apical margin is removed and submitted in a cone-like fashion. The remainder of the gland is sectioned bilaterally in the sagitcal plane along either side of the prostatic urethra. Cut surfaces are smooth pink to tan glistening, with areas of large nodularity and cystic structures. The apex orifice is irregular and dilated to 1.Ocm in greatest dimension. The prostatic urethra is hemorrhagic, with focal areas of necrosis.. The seminal vesicles have gray-white, senitranslucent walls ot normal thickness. Section code:. P1-4 Apex margin P Whole-mount prostate, sagittal plane, left side P6 Whole-mount prostate, sagittal plane, right side. p7-13 Sequential sections of prostate, apex to base, left side P14-21 Sequential sections prostate, apex to base, right side P22  Representative sections of left seminal vesicles. P23  Representative section, right seminal vesicles. MICROSCOPIC: Sections of prostate show extensive urothelial carcinoma in-situ  nvolving almost entire prostate. There are ductal as well as acinar +nvolvement. Focal stromal invasive carcinoma is seen. In addition, CIS involving ejaculatory duct and seminal vesicle is also noted. No lymphovascular invasion is identified. There is no prostate. adenocaricnoma. All margins are negative for tumor.. COMMENT: Intradepartmental consultation:.
