Left breast mastectomy: INVAsIVE CARCINOMA, with lobular features, moderately differentiated Nottingham grade 2 (3 + 3 + 1= 7). largest extent of tumor grossly measuring 2.0 cm (see note) IN SITU CARCiNOMA, with lobular features, nigh nuclear grade, central comedo necrosis and calcificatipns is present in 4 out of 12 slides (see note). Biopsy site is present. Margins negative for in situ and invasive carcinoma.. UUID:79C0D757-508E-4375-AF69-E577629EE0CA TCGA-EW-A133-01A-PR No lymphovascular invasion is present.. Redacted Immunohistochemical results: Estrogen receptor: Positive Progesterone receptor: Positive HER-2: Positive (3+) E-Cadherin:  Negative  Note: This is an unusual neoplasm with morphologic features of a lobular in situ and invasive carcinoma that is E- cadherin negative, with high nuclear grade and necrosis, and positive HER-2. The biological behavior and dinical course of such neoplasms, which are sometimes referred to as Pleomorphic Lobular Carcinoma, may be similar td ductal carcinomas. Suraical Patholoay Tumor Summary Specimen: Total breast Procedure: Total mastectomy Lymph node sampling: Sentinel lymph node Specimen Integrity: Single intact specimen Specimen Laterality: Left Tumor Slte: Lower outer quadrant Tumor Size: Greatest dimension of largest focus of invasion over 0.1 cm: 2.0 cm Tumor Focallty: Single focus of invasive carcinoma. Skin: Invasive carcinoma does not invade into the dermis or epidermis without skin Skeletal muscle: No skeletal muscle present Lobular carcinoma in situ: Present Histologic Type of Invasive Carcinoma: Invasive carcinoma with lobular features Glandular (Acinar)/Tubular Differentiation: Score 3<10% of the tumor are forming glandular/tubular structures Nuclear Pleomorphism: Score 3: Vesicular nuclei, often with prominent nucleoli, exhibiting marked variation in  In size and shape, occasionally with very large and bizarre forms. Mitotic count: Score 1 Overall grade: Grade 2: scores of 6 or 7 Margins: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Distance from closest margin: 1.2 cm from deep margin. Lymph-vascular Invaslon: Not identified Lymph nodes: Number of sentinel lymph nodes examined: 3.

SURGICAL PATHOL Report Patient with biopsy-proven infiltrating lobuiar carcinoma. Piease evaluate margins and if sentinel nodes are H&E negative, do immunohistochemistry. Operation Performedd Left total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. possible axillary node dissection Pre Qperative Diagnosis: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma of left breast Specimen(s) Rereived: A: Left axilla 1 - FS B: Left axilla 1 - FS C: Left axilla 1 ,-FS D: Left breast Gross Description:d A. Received fresh is a 1 x 1 x 0.2 cm adipose tissue fragment. The specimen is submitted in toto in one block for frozen section. B. Received fresh is a 2 x 1 x 0.6 cm adipose tissue fragment. The specimen is submitted in toto in one block for frozen section. c. Received fresh is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm adipose tissue fragment. The specimen is submitted in toto in one $lock for frozen section. D. Received in formalin is an 871-gram, 20 x 16 x 6 cm mastectomy specimen. An ellipse of skin is identifiect it measures 16 x 9 x 0.2 cm. The nipple and areola measure 1.8 cm and 4.5 cm, respectively. The specimen is oriented with one. stitch superior and two stitches medial. . The specimen is inked and cross sectioned in the frozen room. A2 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm, ill-defined lesion was identified in the left lower outer quadrant. This lesion is located 1.2 cm from the deep resection margin (closest). A 0.2 x 0.1 cm tissue sample was taken by Dr. A 0.3 x 0.3 cm tissue sample was taken for tissue bank. A 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm tissue sample was taken by Dr. ' , for research. An additional piec of adipose tissue and skin accompanies the specimen; it measures 7.5 x 4 x 2.5 cm. The skin measures 7 x 2.5 x 0.1 cm. Cross sections throughout the specimen show a multilobulated adipose tissue. No lesions are identified. The fat to stroma ratio is 40:60. The specimen is submitted as follows: 1 Section of nipple and areola 2 Lesion in relation to the deep margin (closest) 3-5 Remainder of lesion in toto 6 Section of left upper inner quadrant 7 Section of left lower inner quadrant 8 Section of central compartment 9 Section of left upper outer quadrant 10 Section of left lower outer quadrant 11&12 Sections of additional breast tissue segment Page 3 of :
