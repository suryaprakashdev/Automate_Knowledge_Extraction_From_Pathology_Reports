Although measurements do not categorically classify these as a micrometastasis, tbe tumor load could be greater than just isolated tumor cells. According to the AJCC," if more than 200 individual tumor cells are identified as single dispersed cells or as a nearly confluent elliptical or spherical focus in a single  histologic section of a lymph node there is a high probability that more than 1,000 cells are present in the lymph node. In these situations, the node should be classified as containing a micrometastases ".. Reference: Cancer Staging Manual. AJCC, 7th edition(2110), New York, p356.

(The specimen is in the formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours). It consist of mastectomy specimen with lymph nodes weighing 1010 grams and mcasuring 29 x 21 x 8 cm with brown skin ellipse measuring 20 x 9 cm, containing grossly unremarkable 1.3 cm in diameter nipple. The skin is tagged with a black stitch designating 12:00 . The posterior margin is composed of smooth fascia which is inked black. The breast is slices in sagittal planes revealing 4 x 3 x 3 cm an ill-defined mass approximately 7:00 to 9:00 position. This mass is 1 cm underneath the skin surface and 4 cm away from the deep fascial margin of resection. On sectioning between 12:00 to 1:00 position focal area of hemorrhage and 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm ill-defined firm area is noted which is 2 cm away from the deep fascial margin of resection and 7 cm away from the 7:00-9:00 mass.. The remaining portions revealed unremarkable yellow mammary fat with streaks of white-gray. mammary parenchyma.

It consists of a 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm fragment of lobulated fatty tissue which reveal I x 0.8 x 0.7 cm lymph node. Lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette FSC 1. Time specimen was removed from the patient: Time specimen was placed in formalin : Ischemic time: 18 minutes D. The specimen is labeled "LEFr BREAST " and is received in formalin. (The specimen is in the formalin more than 6 hours and. less than 48 hours). It consist of mastectomy specimen without lymph nodes weighing 1040 grams and measuring 13 x 19 x 8 cm with brown skin ellipse measuring 20 x 9 cm, containing grossly unremarkable 1.2 cm in diameter nipple. [The skin is tagged with a black stitch designating 12:00 ]. The posterior margin is composed of smooth fascia which is inked black. The treast is slices in sagital planes revealing multiple white-tan firm nodules ranging from 0.5-0.7 cm in greatest diameter and measuring 2.5 x 2 x 2 cm in aggregate. These nodules are located between 6:00 to 8:00 position and are 0.7 cm away from the closest deep fascial margin of resection. The remaining portions reveal unremarkable yellow mammary fat with steaks of white-gray mammary parenchyma..
