A positive Estrogen or Progesterane receptor tumor shows nuclear immunostaining in greater than or equal to 1% of the tumor cells (i.e. and H-score of 1 or higher). The ER and PR. Histologic Score (H-Score, or HS) is calculated as the sum of intensity of staining times the proportion of cells staining and has a. dynamic range of 0 to 300. The semiquantitation immunostaining raw data used to calculate the H-score is also shown above in. the report. Generally, the H-score correlates to percentage of positive cells. According to. the correlation of mean H-score versus percent cells staining for ER is as follows: H-score of 251 (>75% cells staining): H-. score of 130 (51-75% cells staining); -score of 42 (10-50% cells staining): H-score of 4 (<10% cells staining). Estrogen receptor antibody SP1, an IVD, is performed using the Progesterone receptor antibody 1E2, an IVD, is performed using the C&CF tCDO3 metsplostie, ducts bi... irone UUID:1DB8FAFB-FC4A-4401-8316-30FB5352335D C850l3 85753 tcga-bh-a6r9-01a-pr Redacted Crde tB highiot j 8676/3 (8525 J3) (8032/3 Cedle ts JughesF 8575/3 C6C# See DY3usss+No5 C5o.9 OYBuost, csntisIpootion C5O.1 JtJ 8/2/13
