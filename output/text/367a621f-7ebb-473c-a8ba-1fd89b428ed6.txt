Diagnosis This concerns a right hemicolectomy preparation with a tubulovillous adenoma in the cecum, with mild dysplasia of the cylindrical epithelium, with peritumorous, chronic. recidivated concomitant inflammation with acute inflammatory activity. There is a second tubulovillous colon mucus adenoma in the colon ascendens with mild dysplasia of the cylindrical epithelium and reactive concomitant inflammation, with tubular adenomas inn. the area of this second one, with a mucinous carcinoma (corresponding to a mucus-forming adenocarcinoma), with moderate to slight differentiation - corresponding to histopathological differentiation grade 2-3, with tubulovillous adenoma sections on the. surface, with tumor infiltration of the colon wall layers to the tunica muscularis, with. peritumorous chronic recidivated concomitant inflammation, with moderate chronic 1ymphandenitis of the tumor-free local lymph nodes (0/13) and with tumor-free overview slices from all other preparation sections described.. According to the preparation sections at hand, the spreading of the mucinous carcinoma in the colon transversum corresponds to a tumor stage of pT2, pN0, MX, R0. Tumor classification ICDO-DA M-8480/3
