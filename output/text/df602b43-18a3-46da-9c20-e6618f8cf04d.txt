Gross Description: The specimens are received in five containers each 1abeled with the patient's name and medical record number..  The first container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph A.. node". Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple soft' tissue fragments aggregating to a total of 6.5 x 3 x 1 cm. Multiple lymph node candidates are dissected From the specimen ranging in size from 0.9 cm to 5.5 cm in longest dimension. The lymph' node candidates are submitted as follows: A1: 2 possible 1ymph node candidates. A2: One lymph node, serially sectioned A3-A4: one lymph node, serially sectioned "left pelvic lymph B. The second container is additionally identified as,. node".  Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple fibrofatty soft tissue fragments aggregating to a total of 6 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm. Multiple lymph node candidates are dissected from the specimen ranging in size from 0.9 cm to'2 cm and submitted as follows:. B1: One lymph node candidate, bisected B2: One 1ymph node, entire. B3: 2 possibie lymph node candidates, entire B4: One 1ymph node, serially sectioned C. The third container is additionally identified as, "bladder". Received fresh and place in formalin is a 167.1 g cystectomy specimen with overall measurements of 15 x 13.3 x 2.8 cm.  The right ureteral stump measures 3.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter, and the left measures 1 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. Both ureters demonstrate intact patent lumens..  The serosal surface shows yellow. Tobulated fibroadipose tissue with focal cautery artifact.  The urethral margin is inked black, and the bladder is inked blue on the right side and black on the Teft side. The specimen is opened anteriorly to reveal'a 3.8 x 2.2 cm there is a 1.5 x 0.9 cm, superficia1 ulcerated lesion near the left trigone measuring 1.5 cm from the distal urethral margin. On cut section, the larger mass infiltrates into the muscularis propria to a depth of 1.1 cm and is 0.9 cm from the deep margin. The surrounding bladder mucosa is edematous, pink-tan with a uniform 1.0 cm wali thickness.' Bilateral ureteral orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe patent.. Representative sections are submitted as follows:. c1: Distal urethral margin. c2 : Right and left ureter resection margins (right inked blue) c3: Left lateral wall tumor, at maximum depth c4-c8: Additional sections of the ulcerative tumor. c9-c10: ulcerated lesion on the right side near the trigone c11: Uninvolved bladder mucosa 51adder dome c12: uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wa17 c13: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, right lateral wa17 D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "ovaries". Received fresh and placed in formalin are unoriented, bilateral'adnexal structures. One adnexa consists of a 4.1 cm long and 0.9 cm diameter fimbriated fallopian tube. The serosa is pink-red and glistening. The specimen is serially sectioned Page 2
