SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS Specimens Involved Specimens: D: LEFT BREAST SPECIMEN: Other mastectomy Block Number: D4 ER: Positive - Allred Score: 7 = Proportion score: 4 + Intensity Score 3 PR: Positive - Allred Score:.  8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3 COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or equal to 2. Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin : ) for no less than 8 and no lonaer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology:. Mouse anti-human ER and PR, Comment: This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for hormone therapy (1) ER and PR analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) antibody provided by  following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (1), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. 1. Harvey JM, et al. Estrogen receptor status by immunohistochemistry is superior to the ligand-binding. assay for predicting response to adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer. J Clin Oncol. 17:1474- 1481, 1999 CLINICAL HISTORY:  None given PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left breast ca ADDENDUM: E. RIGHT BREAST SKIN, EXCISION: - FRAGMENT OF UNREMARKABLE SKIN, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FiSH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. I. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17 signals ana 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used D4 Source of case:RPCI Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No:NA Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.21 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic.  mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.

Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free and overall survival in stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No treatment decision for stage Il, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER- 2/neu gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test FDA APPROVED REAGENT PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the under the direction of The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis..
