LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS: TPA-left axillary non-sentinel lymph node #1: Positive for carcinoma.. TPB-right axillary Sentinel lymph node #1: Negatyve for carcinoma. Diagnoses called by Dr. to Dr. at GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT AXILLARY NON SLN #1  Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left axillary non-sentinel lymph node #1" is a 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm lymph node. Bisected, a touch prep is performed, and specimen is submitted entirely in cassette A1. B. RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right axillary Sentinel lymph node #1" is a 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm lymph node. It is bisected; touch prep is performed, submitted entirely in cassette B1. C. RIGHT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast" is an oriented 243 g, 16 x 15 x 12 cm mastectomy with 5 x 2.5 cm skin ellipse and 1.7 cm everted nipple. Ink code: anterior/superior-blue, anterior/inferior- orange, posterior-black. Specimen is serially sectioned into 11 slices from medial to lateral with nipple in slice 4 revealing a 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm biopsy site located in the upper outer quadrant, 0.4 cm from the deep margin and less than 0.1 cm from the anterior margin. Representatively submitted: C1: slice 3, upper inner quadrant C2: slice 5, upper inner quadrant C3: slice 7, upper outer quadrant C4: slice 10, upper outer quadrant C6-C8: slice 11, upper outer quadrant (biopsy site). C7: slice 9, lower outer quadrant. C8: slice 8, lower outer quadrant C9: slice 4, lower inner quadrant. C10: slice 2, lower inner quadrant. C11-C12: nipple, perpendicular sections C13: skin and nipple D. LEFT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left breast" is an oriented 359-g, 15 x 13.5 x 3 cm  mastectomy with 9.5 x 3.7 cm skin ellipse and 1.4 cm everted nipple. Ink code: Anterior/superior-blue, anterior/inferior-orange, posterior-black. Specimen is serially sectioned into 11 slices from lateral to medial with nipple in slice 5 revealing 3 lesions: 1) 4 x 3.5 x 3 cm firm stellate mass in the upper inner quadrant slices 6-9 that is closest to the anterior margin at 1.1- cm. 2) 1.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm firm nodule in the upper outer quadrant in slice 1 which is 0.8 cm from the deep margin and 5.7 cm lateral to lesion #1 3) 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm nodule in the lower outer quadrant in slice 1 which is less than 0.1-cm from the anterior margin and 1.6 cm inferior to lesion #2 Tissue is procured. Representatively submitted: D1: slice 1, upper outer quadrant (nodule 2). D2: slice 1, tissue connecting nodule 1 to nodule 2 D3: slice 1, lower outer quadrant (nodule 3) D4: slice 2, posterior mid D5: slice 3, mid section D6: slice 4, mid section D7: slice 5, mid section posterior to nipple.

LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left axillary contents" is an aggregate of yellow-tan soft. tissue, 7 x 5 x 2.2 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified with firm pink-tan cut surfaces. Lymph nodes are. submitted entirely.

ADDENDUM: Specimen A was incorrectly designated in the diagnosis field as "LYMPH NODE, SENTiNEL #1, LEFT AXiLLA, EXCISION"; the correct designation of the specimen is "LYMPH NODE, NON-SENTINEL #1, LEFT AXILLA, ExCisiON." Only the specimen description is changed, the diagnosis remains the same.
