Page 2 Name Lab No.: C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 -- ONE REACTIVE LYMPH NODE (0/1) D. LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY -- INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA (7 CM.). TUMORAL CALCIFICATION/NECROSIS: NONE IDENTIFIED. DCIS/LCIS: NONE IDENTIFIED. SURGICAL MARGINS/NIPPLE, SKIN AND AREOLA: UNINVOLVED. NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST: FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES TO INCLUDE DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA. PTNM CLASSIFICATION: T3 N1 MX; STAGE IIIA. COMMENT: The multiple sections from the tumor reveal patchy areas of tumor infiltration extending up to lactiferous ducts. In addition, the tumor cells also display unfavorable nuclear features in many areas. The ER, PR and Her-2/neu have been performed on the previous biopsy The PanKeratin Immunostain is performed on specimens A, B and C. GROSS: A. The container is received fresh unfixed label:. 3ft sentinel lymph node #1 for frozen section'. The specimen consists of an ovoid mass of pink-tan soft rubbery. tissue mixed with fattv tissue measuring 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension. Frozen section is. obtained by The entire specimen including frozen section in one block. B. The container is received fresh unfixed labele:.  left sentinel lymph node #2 for frozen section". The specimen consists of an ovoid mass of tan-gray soft rubbery. tissue with attached fat. Frozen section is obtained by The entire specimen including frozen section in one block.

Page 3 Name Lab No.: C. The container is received fresh unfixed labele. sentinel lymph node #3 for frozen section". The specimen consist of an ovoid mass of pink-tan soft rubbery tissue measuring 1.3 cm. in diameter in the aggregate. Frozen section is obtained by. The entire specimen including frozen section in one block.. D. The container is received fresh unfixed labele. "left breast". The specimen consists of an 809 gm. apparent left breast which is 23 x 15 x 4 cm. in greatest overall dimension. There is an inverted nipple. The attached skin ellipse is 21 x 9.5 cm.. Sectioning through the breast stroma reveals dense gray-white fibrous tissue varying up to 7.5 cm. in greatest dimension. This area has been previously marked with blue dye. There are scattered cystic spaces varying up to 0.1 cm. in greatest dimension filled with. an amber-colored fluid. Sectioning also reveals a firm tan-gray striated tumor mass which is 7 x approximately 5.5 cm. in greatest overall dimension and is approximately 0.7 cm. from the deep/underlying resection margin. The specimen is submitted in ten blocks. Key Note Block Summary:1--nipple, 2 through 4---cystic spaces, 5-- random, 6 through 10---tumor mass.
