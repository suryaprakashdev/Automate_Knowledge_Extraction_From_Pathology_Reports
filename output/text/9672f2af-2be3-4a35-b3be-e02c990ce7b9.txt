PAGE 2 RUN DATE RUN TIME Specimen Inaniry RUN USER: PATIENT (Continued) SPEC #: GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in the fresh state from the operating room for immediate gross measures 27 cm in length x i0 cm in circumference. Present in the distal portion of the colon is a fungating. red tumor which measures 9 x 6 x 3 cm. located 6 cm from the distal margin and 3 cm from the radial margin. The terminal ileum measures 14 cm in length x 4 cm in circumference x 1 cm in wall thickness and appears unremarkable. The appendix appears to be surgically absent. A representative section of the tumor is removed by aseptic technique. and the tumor obstructs the lumen. infiltrates the subserosa but does not appear to penetrate the visceral peritoneum. The following sections are submitted: Block 1 proximal margin Block 2 distal margin. Blocks 3-6 colon tumor Blocks 7-9 whole lymph nodes. Block 10 one lymph node trisected Block 11 one lymph node bisected. Block 12 one lymph node trisected Regional adipose tissue resected with the specimen measures 30 x 4 x 2 cm. A relatively small number of lymph nodes is present. These are soft and measure up to 1 cm. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION: ADENOCARCINOMA PRESENT IN COLON.
