DIAGNOSIS A) LOWER JUGULAR LYMPH NODE: Lymph node, no tumor. TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY, PARTIAL PHARYNGECTOMY, AND BILATERAL NECK DISSECTION WITH SUBTOTAL THYROIDECTOMY: SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA GRADE 3 INVOLVING LEFT VOCAL CORD, LEFT VENTRICLE, AND LEFT SUPRAGLOTTIC AREA (THICKNESS OF THE TUMOR 2.O CM). Margins of resection free of tumor. Nodular goiter right thyroid. Twenty-five right cervical nodes. Thirty-nine left cervical lymph nodes, no tumor. Specimen designated"B1 to B13", mucosal margins of resection free of tumor. GROSSDESCRIPTION (A) LOwER JUGULAR LYMPH NODE - Two tan lymph nodes (the largest of which measures up to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension) SECTION CODE:A,twOlymph nodes. (B)TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY, PARTIAL PHARYNGEC MY AND BILATERAL NECK DISSECTION WITH suBToTAL THyroIDEcroMy - A total laryngectomy with bilateral neck dissection with overall measurements of 15.0 x 15.0 x 5.5 cm._The laryngeal component is measuring 9.0 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm. On the left supraglottic area there is a fungating ulcerated and soft mass measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. The tumor involves the Teft vocal cord and supraglottic area with impingement on the. midline without involvement of the right glottic area. Tumor extends 2.5 cm in the supraglottic region. No gross involvement of the soft tissue is identified and the mucosa surrounding the tumor appears unremarkable. There is an additional nodule in the left pyriform sinus.. .There is no connection between this nodule and the main tumor. The nodule is light-tan, slightly raised and measuring1.5cm x1.0x0.4 cm. SEcrion coDe: The specimen is submitted as follows: Mucosal margins for frozen section as follows: B, posterior cricoid; B2, inferior left pyriform margin; B3, inferior lateral left pyriform; B4, left ateral pyriform margin;. B5, left superolateral pyriform; B6, left superior pyriform; B7 left lateral. mollecula B8midline and right mollecula B9, right mollecula; B10, right superior pyriform; B11,right lateral pyriform; B12, right inferior pyriform; B13, right post cricoid.The tumoris submitted entirely from right to left and the block code is B14, right transglottic; B15, right supraglottic mucosa; B16-B31,sequential sectionsfrom midline to the left pyriform sinus tumor and Page 1 of 2 History Case Pathology Report History Case Pathology File under: Pathology
