Clinical Diagnosis & History:. Patient with renal mass. Specimens Submitted: 1: SP: Lt. kidney 2: SP: Para-aortic lymph node. 3: SP: Hilar lymph node DIAGNOSIS: 1) KIDNEY, LEFT; EXCISION:  RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CHROMOPHOBE TYPE. THE TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER IS 13.5 CM.THE TUMOR IS CONFINED WITHIN THE RENAL CAPSULE. NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS FIBROSIS AND FOCAL CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.TUMOR EXTENDS INTO THE RENAL SINUS.TUMOR BULGES INTO THE RENAL PELVIS BUT DOES NOT EXTEND INTO IT.THE ADRENAL GLAND IS NOT SUBMITTED. TUMOR SHOWS FOCAL NECROSIS AND HYALINZATION.VASCULAR INVASION PRESENT WITHIN THE RENAL SINUS. 2) LYMPH NODE, PARA-AORTIC; EXCISION: - ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE (0/1). 3) LYMPH NODE, HILAR; EXCISION: - THREE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/3). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Descrintion: 1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section and is labeled "Left kidney".  It consists of a kidney, with perinephric fat, portion of ureter and hilar vessels.  The adrenal gland not present. The overall dimensions of the specimen are 26 x 15 x 8.5 cm. The kidney weighs 1542 grams. The renal capsule strips off easily. The kidney measures 18 x 6.5 x 6.4 cm. Within the parenchyma of the kidney there is a yellow-tan mass measuring 13.5 in greatest dimension. The tumor appears to extend into the perirenal fat. The remainder of the renal parenchyma exhibits no abnormalities. The renal pelvis appears involve by tumor. The renal sinus appears involve by tumor. The renal vein appears uninvolved by tumor. The perirenal fat is unremarkable. The segment of ureter measures 4.2 cm in Length and is unremarkable.  Representative sections are submitted.. Summary of sections:.
