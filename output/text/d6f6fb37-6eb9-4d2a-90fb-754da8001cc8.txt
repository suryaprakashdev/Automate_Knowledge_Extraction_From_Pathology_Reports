Superior yellow, inferior orange, anterior red, lateral blue,. medial green, inferior black. There is a central firm tumor measuring 1.5 cm. in greatest cross sectional dimension. A portion of the central tumor is taken for research purposes. Sections after fixation. Rs15. +RR11 D. Received in formalin labeled "#6" and consists of a. yellow and tan piece of soft tissue measuring 3 x 2 x 0.7 cm. It is not completely clear which side of the specimen is the external side. The external surface of the specimen is inked.. Sections after fixation. Rs4. E. Received in formalin labeled "#12" and consists of a yellow piece of soft tissue measuring 3 x 2.5 x 1 cm. The external surface of the specimen is inked. Rs4.. F. Received in formalin labeled "g" and consists of a yellow piece of soft tissue measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm..  The external surface of the specimen is inked. Sections after fixation.. RS2. G. Received in formalin labeled "#3" and consists of a piece of yellow soft tissue measuring 3.2 x 1.5 x 1 cm.. The external surface of specimen is inked. Sections after fixation.. RS3. REPORT REVISED ON AT MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A. A single lymph node is negative for malignancy.. B. A single lymph node is negative for malignancy.. [At the request of some staff oncologists and in keeping with the opinion of some experts in breast pathology, immunohistochemical stains for keratin were not used on the. sentinel lymph node sections in this case. These stains can be obtained if. desired. Our paraffin blocks are retained for 10 years. (Schwartz. GF et al. Cancer 94(10):2542, 2002)].

C.  Invasive carcinoma Tumor type: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Tumor grade: 2 (Elston SBR grade; A/N/M =3/2/1 ) Mitotic index: 0 mitoses/10 HpFs (1 HPF = 0.196 sq mm) Tumor size: 1.5 cm. Specimen margins: Negative for malignancy. Carcinoma is 1 cm. from the nearest inked margin.. Vessel invasion: Absent.. Calcification: Absent. Non-tumorous breast: Apocrine metaplasia, cyst formation and intraductal epithelial hyperplasia without atypia are present. pTNM stage: T1 Prognostic markers:  See previous biopsy. D-G. Additional biopsy pieces are negative for. malignancy. Cyst formation and apocrine metaplasia are seen in specimen D at 6 o'clock. After discussion with Dr.. specimen C was re-examined.
