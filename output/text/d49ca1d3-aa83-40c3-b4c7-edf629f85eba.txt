FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Part 1: Lymph nOde, Left AxIlLAry SentInel nOde #1, BIOpSy - TWO SENTINEL LyMPH NODES, NEGATIVE fOR CARCinOMA (0/2). Part 2: Lymph nOde, Left AxilLary Sentinel nOde #2, biOpsy -- TWO SENTINEL LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/2). Part 3: breast, Leet, 12 O'clOck Segmental mastectomy - A.

THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES 1.9 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION (GROSS MEASUREMENT). c. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2, SOLiD TYPE. D. DCIS CONSTITUTES LESS THAN 5% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR MASS, AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA. E. SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR INFILTRATING CARCINOMA AND DCIS. INFILTRATING CARCINOMA IS 0.3 CM FROM THE CLOSEST POSTERIOR MARGIN (31). F.  NO LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED.S G.  FOcAl Ductal epithelial hyperplAsiA. H. PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES.

The immunohistochemical stains for E- cadherin and P120 indicate that some tumors cells show the patten of ductal carcinoma (membranous stains for E- cadherin and P120), and some tumors show the pattern of lobular carcinoma (weak stain for E-cadherin and strong and  diffuse cytoplasmic stain for P120. mary Tumor Site screpancy s (circle):
