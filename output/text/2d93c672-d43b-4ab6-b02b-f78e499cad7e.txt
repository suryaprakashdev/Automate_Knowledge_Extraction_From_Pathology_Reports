ANCILLARY STUDIES: (RESULTS FROM CASE Estrogen Receptor: positive (99% of tumor cells with nuclear positivity) Progesterone Receptor: positive (99% of tumor cells with nuclear positivity Her2/neu : Immunoperoxidase studies: negative (1+) GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh is a skin-sparing left radical mastectomy weighing 756 grams and measuring 27 cm from medial to the axillary tail. 18 cm from superior to inferior. and 2.5 cm anterior to posterior. There is a linear portion of skin including nipple measuring 9 x 2.1 cm. A mass is palpated in the lower portion of the upper outer quadrant. The deep margin underlying this tumor is inked black. and the anterior margin is inked blue. A cut is made from the posterior side. and a portion of tumor is given to the Tumor Bank. The 1 tumor measures 2.5 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm. It is firm with focal areas of hemorrhage.  There is an. adjacent well-circumscribed tan-white soft. freely mobile area measuring up to 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. The carcinoma measures 0.8 cm from the posterior black-inked margin and 0.9 cm from the anterior blue-inked margin. The other margins are greater than 3 cm ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

RUN DATE PAGE 3 RUN TIME: RUN USER: SPEC #: (Continued) GROSS DESCRIPTION:(Continued) from the tumor including the nipple.  The remainder of the breast is serially sectioned to. reveal no additional masses, cysts or other gross abnormalities. There is a fat to fibrous ratio of up to 50:50. The most fibrotic areas are closest to the lateral quadrants. particularly the upper outer quadrant. The detached axillary tail itself measures 13.2 x 5.5 x 2.6 cm. Serial section reveals multiple lymph nodes, the largest of which measures 2.2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Sections are as follows: tumor as it most closely approximates the anterior margin. 2 tumor as it most closely approximates the posterior margin. 3 additional representative section of tumor 4 representative section of fibrotic area adjacent to tumor. 5 representative section of nipple 6-7 additional representative sections of very fibrotic areas in the. lateral guadrant 8 representative sections of the medial quadrants 9-10 multiple lymph nodes 11-12 one lymph node each. bisected Signed (signature on file) ** END OF REPORT ** ./23/l3
