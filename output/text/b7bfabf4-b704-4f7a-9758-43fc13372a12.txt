Case #: FInAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGy REPORT measures 20.5 cm from superior to inferior, 29 cm from medial to lateral, and 4.5 cm from superficial to deep. There is a broad overtying semi-circular portion of tan skin measuring 23 x 14.5 cm. In the media! inferior edge of the skin, there is a 4.5 cm areola with a protuberant 1.4 cm nipple. The skin is otherwise unremarkable. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which partially consists of smooth facial appearing tissue, is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal Iobulated fatty tissue and scattered tan-white ribrous parenchyma. In the central inferior portion of the breast, along the superior medial edge of the areola, there is an area of fibrous parenchyma which has a slightly stellate appearance but is soft and rubbery. This stellate area is 2 cm in maximum dimension. it is 4 cm or greater from the deep, inferior, and superior margin and is 2 cm from the closest skin. The breast parenchyma in the lower outer quadrant. has a rough fine nodular feel but there are no areas which have a stellate or retracted appearance. There are no lymph nodes identified within the lateral portion of the excision. Representative sections are submitted.Section summary: B1) nipple and tissue just deep to nipple, B2-B3) stellate fibrous parenchyma centra! inferior breast, 84) representative upper inner quadrant, B5) lower inner quadrant, 86) upper outer quadrant, B7-B8) lower outer quadrant, including representative lower outer quadrant deep margin. C. The specimen is labeled right breast tissue, additional inferior margin and is received in formalin. It consists of two irregular fragments of lobulated fatty tissue with an aggregate weight of 52 grams. The larger specimen measures 10.5 x 4.8 x 1.6 cm and the smaller specimen measures 4.2 x 2.8 x 1.7 cm. The surgical margins of these specimens are not designated. The larger specimen is inked black and the smaller specimen is inked green. Serial sections of both specimens reveal predominantly lobulated soft to. pale yellow fatty tissue without palpable areas of nodularity. Representative sections of the larger specimen are submitted in cassettes C1-C3. Representative sections of the smaller specimen are submitted in cassette C4. Following review of the initial slides, additional sections are submitted in Cs-C9. D. The specimen is labeled right breast tissue and is received without fixative. It consists of a mastectomy. specimen weighing 1,285 grams. A black suture is present and is not otherwise designated but is arbitrarily assumed to represent lateral. With this orientation, the specimen measures 24.4 cm from medial to lateral, 21.8 cm from superior to inferior, and 6.4 cm from superficial to deep. There is an overlying broad elliptical portion of tan skin which measures 24 x 16 cm. In the medial inferior skin, there is a 4 cm areola and 1.5 cm protuberant nipple. The skin shows two small areas of hemorrhagic discoloration which are Iocated 3 and 3.5 cm superior to the nipple. No other skin lesions are identified. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the anterior- inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin, which consists partially of smooth facial tissue, is inked black. The breast is serially sectioned at close intervals to reveal a firm stellate appearing tumor mass within the central Iateral breast, approximately 4.5 cm lateral to the nippie. This stellate area is 1.2 cm in maximum dimension. Centrally, within this stellate mass is a biopsy site clip. This stellate mass is 3.5 cm from the closest inferior margin, 11 cm from the closest superior margin, 14 cm from the closest medial margin, and 11 cm from the closest lateral margin. It is 3.5 cm from the closest deep margin and approximately 3 cm Page 5 Case #: This reoort continues... (FINAL) Printed: Phone: Patient Nan ) - Page 5 Pathology Report - Page 5/6

Case #: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT from the skin. A second palpably firm and stellate appearing mass is located in the superior central breast approximately 4 cm superior to the nipple. This second area measures 0.8 cm in maximum dimension. It is 4 cm from the closest deep margin, 3.5 cm from the closest skin, 6.5 cm from the closest inferior margin, 9 cm from the closest superior margin. 10 cm from the closest medial margin, and greater than 10 cm from the lateral margin. A twisted biopsy site clip is also embedded within this stellate mass.. The central breast tissue has an ill-defined firm area measuring approximately 7-8 cm in diameter. This. area of firmness involves multiple quadrants of the breast. In the far lateral portion of the breast, there is a firm 1.8 cm lymph node. Representative tissue of the central lateral stellate mass is retained for research purposes. Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: D1) nipple and tissue just deep to nipple, D2-O3) complete cross-section of central lateral palpable mass,. D4) additional section of superior edge of central lateral tumor,.
