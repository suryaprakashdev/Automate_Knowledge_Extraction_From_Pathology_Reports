Clinical History: -year-old male with right renal mass. Per , the patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma. Gross Description: Received are three appropriately labeled containers. Container A is additionally labeled "kidney, right, anterior renal mass, partial nephrectomy" and consists of a 10.6 gram, 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm brown/tan fragment of kidney. The surgical margin is inked black. The renal capsule is inked yellow. A defect, 1.2 x 0.8 cm is identified and the external surface around the defect is inked yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the blue and black inked tube margin. Sectioning reveals a pale tan, at least 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm well- circumscribed mass. The yellow inked defect goes right through this mass. The mass abuts the yellow-inked margin, black-inked margin and is less than 1 mm from the blue inked margin. The adjacent renal parenchyma is yellow to brown/tan, homogeneous. Block Summary: Al - Perpendicular sections of the first slice with blue inked margin, including closest approach of the mass A2-A3 - Representative sections of the mass with adjacent uninvolved renal parenchyma A4 - Additional representative section of the mass Container B is additionally labeled "kidney, right, posterior medial renal mass, partial nephrectomy" and consists of a 28.0 gram, 4.0 x 3.7 x 3.0 cm fragment of kidney, that was received with a prior cut for tissue procurement. The capsule is inked blue and the surgical margin is inked black. Sectioning reveals a pale tan, friable, well-circumscribed mass, 3.8 x 3.6 x 2.9 cm. Focal gray to red/tan areas consistent with necrosis and hemorrhage respectively, are identified. Normal renal parenchyma is not identified in the specimen. The mass is O.1 cm from the blue and black inked margins. Representative sections, including closest approach to the margin are submitted in blocks B1-B2. Representative sections from the grossly necrotic and hemorrhagic area is submitted in block B3. Container c is additionally labeled "kidney, right, posterior lateral renal mass" and consists of a 13.5 gram 3.4 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm fragment of kidney, with a 3.5 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm fibroadipose tissue attached. The capsule is inked blue and the resection

margin is inked black. The capsule is yellow to brown/tan, smooth, and unremarkable. Sectioning reveals a pale tan friable mass, 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.1 cm. The mass is hemorrhagic in the center,. abuts the blue inked capsule and is 0.2 cm from the black inked. resection margin.
