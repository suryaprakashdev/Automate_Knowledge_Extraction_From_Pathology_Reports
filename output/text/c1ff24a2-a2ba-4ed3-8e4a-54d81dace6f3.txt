TeD O-3 Sobeleer arcinoma. ingestratrg 85q03 LNOS CGC CsD.9 pat BueI,ipper sutir. guaclioe Final Surgical Pathology Report C504 Procedure: 4|1213 Diagnosis A. Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel, excision - Metastatic carcinoma in two of two (2/2) lymph nodes in this part. B. Breast, right, excision - Invasive lobular carcinoma, 0.5 cm in greatest dimension (see microscopic description, including for prognostic marker results). Lobular carcinoma-in-situ. Fibrocystic changes, with microcalcifications present. Skin, nipple, and deep margin negative for tumor. C. Breast, left, excision - Invasive lobular carcinoma, forming a 3.2 cm in greatest dimension mass, with additional scattered foci of invasive lobular carcinoma present. Invasive lobular carcinoma present at least very near (<l mm from), and. possibly at, the deep margin in the separate foci. Skin and nipple negative for malignancy. Lobular carcinoma-in-situ. Biopsy site changes. Fibrocystic changes, with microcalcifications present. D.  Lymph nodes, left axillary, excision - Metastatic carcinoma in nineteen of twenty-two (19/22) lymph nodes in this part, including with metastatic carcinoma in the superior-most lymph node. Microscopic Description: A,D. There is metastatic carcinoma in two of two (2/2) sentinel lymph nodes in part A, and in nineteen of twenty-two (19/22) lymph nodes in part D. Thus overall in this case, there is metastatic carcinoma in. twenty-one of twenty-four (21/24) lymph nodes (pN3a). There is extracapsular extension. The largest involved lymph node is one of the. sentinel lymph nodes, 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node in part D is negative for tumor.  There is metastatic carcinoma in. the superior-most lymph node in part D..  Please note that in addition to examining H&E stained sections, immunostains with antibodies to keratin (AEi-AE3) were examined on representative blocks in both parts to aid in assessment. B. The following template summarizes the findings in this part: Invasive carcinoma: Present Histologic type: Invasive lobular carcinoma, identified incidentally in block B4 Histologic grade: UUID:A8834D03-81F5-43BC-A4AB-F215C89CB095 Overall grade: 2 TCGA-A7-A5Zx-01A-pr Redacted Architectural score: 3 Nuclear score: 2 Mitotic score: 1 Greatest dimension (pT): slightly >0.5 cm (pTlb) Specimen margins: Negative Vessel invasion: Not identified Nipple: Negative for tumor Invasion of skin or chest wall: Not identified

Ductal carcinoma in situ: Not identified Description of non-tumorous'breast: Fibrocystic changes, with microcalcifications present. Please note Comments: There is also lobular carcinoma-in-situ present. that immunostains with antibodies to p63, keratin (AE1-AE3), and e-cadherin were examined on representative blocks to aid in assessment. Distant metastasis (pM): Not applicable Breast prognostic marker results. Results Estrogen receptor: 80% / moderate intensity Progesterone receptor: 5% / weak intensity Her2 by IHC: 1+ Interpretation Estrogen receptor: Positive. Progesterone receptor: Weakly positive Her2 by IHc: Negative for Her2 expression Comments Fixation time: 30:00 Cold ischemia time: 0:30 The analyzed tissue met quality requirements of the Asco/cAp guidelines for Her2 testing.  Control materials stained appropriately.. Based on data collected in our laboratory and reported in the literature we recommend FIsh analysis for Her2 in cases that stain with intermediate intensity by immunohistochemistry.. Prognostic markers were done by immunohistochemical stain on paraffin sections from 10% neutral buffered formalin fixed tissue using antibodies on a Benchmark automated stainer. The Her2 antibody is clone 4B5 and has'been approved by the FDA as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom Herceptin treatment is considered. This laboratory meets the test validation and quality assurance requirements of the Asco/cAP guidelines for Her2. ER and PR testing for. carcinoma of the breast C. The following template summarizes the findings in this part: Invasive carcinoma: Present. Histologic type: Invasive lobular carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma is identified comprising the main mass lesion, as well as in multiple additional foci in random sections of this breast (blocks c7, C8,  C10, cll). Histologic grade: Overali grade: 2 Architectural score: 3 Nuclear score: 2 Mitotic score:  Greatest dimension (pT): The main mass lesion is 3.2 cm in Specimen margins: Although the margins surrounding the main mass lesion are negative, tumor in the additional foci of invasive lobular carcinoma is present at least very near (<l mm from), and possibly at, the deep margin, with fragmentation hindering assessment. Vessel invasion: Not identified Nipple: Negative for tumor. Invasion of skin or chest wall: Not identified.

Ductal carcinoma in situ: Not identified Description of non-tumorous breast: Fibrocystic changes, with microcalcifications present. Biopsy site changes.. Comments: There is also lobular carcinoma-in-situ present. Please note that immunostains with antibodies to keratin (AEl-AE3), and e-cadherin were examined on representative blocks to aid in assessment. Distant metastasis (pM): Not applicable. Prognostic markers: Previously performed Note: have reviewed this case. [A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified as analyte specific reagents. These antibodies are monitored and controlled in our laboratory and their performance for in vitro diagnosis is well described in the medical literature.  They have not been cleared or approved by the FDA.] Specimen A.  Left axillary sentinel node. B. Right breast C. Left breast D. Left axillary contents Clinical Information CLINICAL HISTORY: yo white female with invasive lobular cancer left breast Intraoperative Consultation A. Metastatic carcinoma present. Gross Description A.  Received fresh in a container labeled "left axillary sentinel node" is a portion of tissue which is tan-yellow and fatty externally. On palpation, it appears to consist of two adherent lymph nodes, spanning an area 2.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm and 1.8 x 1 x 0.4 cm.  On cut surface, both vary from soft and tan to yellow, to firmer and tan-white. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in two blocks, with one lymph node per block.. B. Received fresh (excised at received at placed in formalin at , in a container labeled "right breast" is a 21 cm from superior to inferior x 18 cm from medial to lateral x 3.2 cm from anterior to posterior soft tan-yellow mastectomy specimen, with an orienting suture present. On the anterior surface there is a 7.6 x 4.4 cm tan-white skin ellipse, with a centrally located 1.3 x 1.3 x 1 cm nipple. The intact deep margin is inked, and the specimen is serially sectioned. On cut surface, the specimen consists of interspersed yellow adipose tissue and tan tissue, without focal lesion. following fixation. RS-10, BLOCK suMMARy: B1,B2 - upper outer quadrant; B3,B4 - upper inner quadrant; B5,B6 - lower inner quadrant; B7,B8 - lower outer quadrant; B9 - central breast; B10 - nipple. C. Received fresh (excised at. received at placed in formalin at in a container labeled "left breast" is a 20.5 cm. from superior to inferior x 18.8 cm from medial to lateral x 3.2 cm from anterior to posterior soft tan-yellow mastectomy specimen, with an orienting suture present. On the anterior surface there is a 7 x 5 cm

There is a circumscribed 3.2 x 2.9 x 1.8 cm rubbery tan-white mass within the upper outer quadrant. The lesion is 1.1 cm from the deep margin, and 1.3 cm from the anterior surface, which is subsequently inked blue.
