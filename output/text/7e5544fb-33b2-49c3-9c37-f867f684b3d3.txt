GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) UPPER AND MID JUGULAR NODES, HEMOSTAT SUPERIOR - A fragment of adipose tissue (5.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm) containing sixteen lymph nodes ranging in size. from 0.2 to 1.8 cm. Lymph nodes are serially dissected from superior to inferior and submitted in Al-A12, in order. sEction coDe: A1-A9, A12, single lymph node in each cassette; A10, three small lymph nodes; Al1, three' smalI lymph' nodes. *FS/DX: PERIPHERAL NERVE, NO TUMOR PRESENT. (B) LEFT MANDIBULAR NERVE, HEMOSTAT PROXIMAL -'A str!p of nerVe tiSSue (3.O X inked black and is taken for frozen section en face with the adjacent nerve in Tongitudinal.  The proximal marain is inked d red and the remaining tissue is. totally submitted in b2. (C) TONGUE MARGIN, HEMOSTAT ANTERIOR,S NEW MARGIN INKED - An irregular strip of' tongue tissue (5.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm) with hemostat designating anterior. new margin is previously inked by surgeon. The INK code: Anterior-red, posterior-yellow, deep-black, previously inked. section code: c1-c4, new margin en' face for frozen section anterior to posterior; c5-c6, random mucosal section. *FS/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT. permanent. (D) BUCCAL MUCOSAL MARGIN, HEMOSTAT ANTERIOR - A strip of red-tan muCOsa (4.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm) with hemostat designating anterior. INK code: Anterior-red, posterior-yellow, deep-black. SeCTION coDE:  D1-d3 margin, en face, anterior to posterior, for frozen section. *FS/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT. (E) ANTERIOR TONSILLAR PILLAR MARGIN,S  HEMOSTAT ANTERIOR - A strip of red-tan mucosa (2.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) with a hemostat designating anterior. Ink code: Anterior-red, posterior-yellow, deep-black. section_code: El. E2, margin, en face for frozen section, anterior to posterior. *fs/DX:  NO TUMOR PRESENT. (F) TUMOR HEMIMANDIBLE AND SUBMANDIBULAR TRIANGLE - TumOr and soft tisSue (6.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm) with contiguous submandibular triangle (5.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm and portion of 1eft hemimandible (composite hemimandibulectomy) (7.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm). Overlying mucosa on the soft tissue measures 5.0 x 1.0 cm.. A crescent shape centrally ulcerated tumor is present on the mucosal. surface, it measures 3.0 x 3.0'x 2.5 cm and has pushing borders, but there is no definite invasion into the submandibular triangle.. 'The tumor is white-gray with a vague lobulated appearance..  The margins have been previously examined by frozen section.. Five possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.5 to 0.8 cm are dissected.  The portion of mandible is grossly unremarkable. The bone is pending decalcification. secrion coDe: F1-F4, tumor; F5, tumor and contiguous salivary gland tissue: E6-E0 -ingle lymph node in each cassette; F10, one possibTe lymph node.
