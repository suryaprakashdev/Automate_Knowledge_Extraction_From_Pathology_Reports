TSS ID. TSS ID:t Oc id:. Date of Procurement Gross Description: Labeled left breast lumpectomy. Received is an 85 g unoriented ovoid  portion of lobulated tan fibroadipose tissue measuring 8 x 7 x 3.5 cm. The  specimen contains 2 needle localization wires and there is an accompanying 1cs-0-3 cnrcm0ma unfiHfnattry oluct Nos 85o0f7  specimen mammogram, which is used to orient the specimen and select the Sits: busot prs C509 4/8/n h sections. The radiologist has circled two areas of concern marked 1 and 2, both of which are associated with microcalcifications. The margins are  inked blue for microscopic evaluation. Upon sectioning, area 1 is present  near the midpoint of the long axis and consists of a 2.4 x 1.9 x 1.4 cm  irregular mass. The cut surfaces of the mass are white-tan, smooth and have well-defined borders. The mass grossly abuts the inked margin. At one end of the mass is a 0.7 x 0.3 cm biopsy cavity containing collagen material  and a small metal clip as well as adjacent focal hemorrhage. Area 2 is  present at one end of the specimen and consists of a 1.2 x 0.9 cm ovoid  portion of firm white fibrous tissue that is slightly more dense than the adjacent white fibrous tissue. This area comes to within 0.7 cm of the  nearest inked margin. The remaining cut surfaces are tan and lobulated with  interspersed areas of condensed white fibrous tissue comprising  approximately 25% of the specimen. Poorly-defined areas of blue staining are also present. Microscopic Description: UUID: 5B9C0E4A-3958-4ECF-B8B2-E758E04E7722 TCGA-E9-A1R2-01A-PR Redacted  Microscopic sections of the principal mass (grossly area 1) demonstrate  an infiltrating markedly pleomorphic epithelial neoplasm with a brisk mitotic rate that is arranged in nests. Occasional areas of intratumoral high grade ductal carcinoma in situ are Diagnosis Details: INVASIVE BREAST CARCINOMA CHECKLIST
