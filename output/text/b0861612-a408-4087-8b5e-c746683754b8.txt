SPECIMEN A.  Right colon and terminal ileum B. Hernia sac, left inguinal C. Omentum CLINICAL NOTES PRE-OP DIAgnosIS: Right colon cancer. CLINIcAL HIsToRy: Large cecal cancer, bilateral inguinal hernia left containing small bowel and sigmoid. Right containing appendix. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled "right colon and terminal ileum" is a previously unopened 25 cm. segment of proximal right colon with attached 20 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to scabrous tan pink serosa with a copious amount of attached mucin colon, mesentery and unremarkable omentum. An appendix measuring 6.6 cm. in length which ranges from 0.7 cm. proximally up to 1.5 cm. distally is present. A scant amount of tan white fibrinopurulent exudate appears to be present, adjacent to the distal tip. On sectioning, the lumen is pinpoint, surrounded by unremarkable tan pink mucosa and no discrete transmural defect is identified. The proximal and distal margins measure 4.0 and 5.8 cm. in circumference respectively. On opening, there is a nearly circumferential 10.0 x 7.8 cm. firm tan pink to papilliferous tan red lesion present at and distal to the ileocecal valve. On sectioning, the lesion has a maximal thickness of 3.4 cm. with extension into the surrounding mesentery to within 0.5 cm. of the inked free radial serosal surface. The colonic mucosa is otherwise glistening tan pink with regular folds in the wall averaging 4 cm. in thickness. Several additional purple tan pink to tan red polypoid lesions measuring up to 1.2 cm. in greatest dimension are present. The largest polyp is 7 cm. distal from the mass. The ileal mucosa is unremarkable, glistening tan pink with regular folds and the wall averages 0.5 cm. in thickness. A portion of tumor and portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. Multiple rubbery tan white to tan pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 6 cm. in greatest dimension. The four largest lymph nodes appear involved by metastasis (representative sections only given). Representative sections are submitted in eighteen blocks as labeled. RS-18.

BLOcK SumMARy: 1 - Proximal and distal margins; 2-5 - tumor to inked free radial serosal surface (cassette 4 and 5 contain bisected single slice with point of continuity inked orange); 6 - tumor to distal mucosa; 7-9 - additional colonic polyps (7 - one polyp, 7 cm. distal from large tumor, 8 and 9 - two polyps per cassette); 10 - random ileum and colon; 11 - proximal appendix and one-half of. bisected distal tip; 12 - remainder of bisected distal tip; 13 six whole lymph nodes; 14 - five whole lymph nodes; 15 - four whole lymph nodes; 16 - representative of two grossly positive lymph nodes; 17,18 - representative of two g itive lymph nodes. (one node represented per cassette). B. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "hernia left inguinal" is an 11 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm. pink-tan. fibromembranous saccular tissue with yellow lobular fat. The specimen is sectioned to show no other discrete gross lesions. identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in two cassettes. Rs-2 C. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "omentum" is a 13 x 8 x 3 cm. piece of fatty tissue consistent with omentum. The specimen is sectioned to show a yellow. lobular fatty cut surface which is grossly consistent with omental fat. No discrete gross lesions are identified or palpated. Representative se. ions of the specimen are submitted in eight. cassettes. Rs-8 MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A. Microscopic examination of the right colon and terminal ileum resection specimen reveals Histologic type: Invasive adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Primary tumor (pT): Tumor originates in cecum and extensively infiltrates through the wall of the cecum and is present on the serosal surface/penetrates visceral peritoneum (pT4A). Proximal margin: Negative for tumor Distal margin: Negative for tumor Circumferential (radial) margin: Not applicable.. Distance of tumor from closest margin: 20 cm. from proximal margin Vascular invasion: Prominent lymphatic space invasion is present.. Regional lymph nodes (pN): Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in. 4 of 17 lymph nodes (pN2a)

Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present with prominent extranodal tumor metastases adjacent to the appendix in the periappendiceal fat and adjacent to the large pericolonic lymph nodes. Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot evaluate pMx Other findings: Five adenomatous polyps are present. Deep to the largest adenomatous polyp which is 7 cm. distal from the large primary tumor there is intracolonic metastasis with additional adenocarcinoma present in the muscularis propria and in dilated lymphatic spaces. B. Microscopic examination reveals benign fibromembranous tissue lined by mesothelium consistent with hernia sacs. No tumor is identified within the hernia sac tissue. C. Microscopic examination of the omentum reveals fatty tissue. No metastatic tumor is identified in the omentum. DIAGNOSIS A. Right colon and terminal ileum, resection: Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cecum invasive through the entire colonic wall through the visceral peritoneum present on serosal surface (pT4a). Much lymphatic space invasion present, intracolonic metastasis present 7 cm. distal to tumor. Five additional adenomatous polyps present. Metastatic adenocarcinoma present in 5 of 18 pericolonic lymph nodes (pN2a).  Extranodal tumor present including periappendiceal extranodal metastatic tumor. Mucosal margins negative for tumor. B. Hernia sac, left inguinal, resection: Benign hernia sac tissue, no malignancy identified. C. Omentum, excision: Benign omental fat, no malignancy identified. End Of Report
