SPECIMENS: A. KIDNEY LEFT  B. LYMPH NODES INTER-AORTIC CAVAL C. LYMPH NODES PERI-AORTIC SPECIMEN(S): A. KIDNEY LEFT B. LYMPH NODES INTER-AORTIC CAVAL C. LYMPH NODES PERI-AORTIC GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. KIDNEY LEFT Received fresh is a 1,098 gram nephrectomy specimen with attached perinephric fat measuring 23 x 14 x 9 cm. The cortical surface has a nodular appearance. The kidney proper is 18 x 12 x 8 cm. The parenchyma has been replaced by a papillary tan-brown mass measuring 17 x 11.8 x 8 cm. It has obliterated the renal pelvis and calyces. Areas of hemorrhage and necrosis are noted. There are clear fluid filled cysts throughout. There is a rim of normal appearing renal tissue measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.1 cm. On sectioning through the mass it extends into the perinephric fat. In the hilar region there is a nodule that measures 6.3 x 4.7 x 2.7 cm. On sectioning, it appears to be an extension of a tubular structure. No adrenal gland is identified and within the perinephric fat lymph nodes are found ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. Representative sections were taken for tissue procurement and a gross photograph was taken. Representative sections are submitted in A1 (vascular and ureteral margins), A2-A12 (tumor), A13 (renal parenchyma), and A14-A17 (multiple possible lymph nodes). B. LYMPH NODES INTER-AORTIC CAVAL Received in formalin is a piece of yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring 3.7 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm. Eight possible Iymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.8 cm. Specimen is submitted in B1 (lymph nodes), B2-B4 (one lymph node), B5 (the rest of tissue). C. LYMPH NODES PERI-AORTIC Received in formalin is a piece of yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 3.2 x 1.2 cm. Three lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.6 to 4.7 cm. in greatest dimension. Specimen is submitted in C1 (one lymph node), C2-C3 (one lymph node), C4-C5 (one lymph node), and C6 (the rest of tissue). DIAGNOSIS: A. KIDNEY, LEFT, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY: - PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, TYPE 2, INVADING PERIRENAL AND RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE - TUMOR SIZE 17 X 11.8 X 8 CM - FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3 - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO SEVEN OUT OF SEVEN LYMPH PERINEPHRIC LYMPH NODES (7/7) - VASCULAR AN URETERAL MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (SEE NOTE) - SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT B. LYMPH NODES, INTER-AORTIC CAVAL, EXCISION:  - NO TUMOR SEEN IN FOUR LYMPH NODES (0/4) C. LYMPH NODES, PERI-AORTIC, EXCISION: - METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO TWO OUT OF FOUR LYMPH NODES (2/4) NOTE: There are numerous perinephric-adipose-tissue tumor depositions/lymph node involvements. The tumor is present at the inked surface in one of these foci; therefore correlation with the surgical. findings is recommended for better assessment of the final status of the Gerota#s fascial margin. SYNOPTIC REPORT - KIDNEY (PARTIAL OR RADICAL) Specimen Type: Radical nephrectomy Without adrenal gland Laterality: Left Tumor Site: Upper pole  Middle pole Lower pole Focality: Unifocal
