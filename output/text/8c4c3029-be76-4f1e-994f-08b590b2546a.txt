Seven of thirteen peripancreatic lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma (7/17). Five periduodenal lymph nodes all negative for metastatic. carcinoma. Duodenal mucosa not involved by tumor.. pT3N1Mx. See Synoptic report. Reported by: Electronically sianed Verified: Synoptic Report D: Pancreas (Exocrine), Macroscopic SPECIMEN: Head of pancreas PROCEDURE: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple resection), partial pancreatectomy TUMOR SITE: Pancreatic head Uncinate process TUMOR SIZE: Greatest dimension: 3.3 cm D: Pancreas (Exocrine), Microscopic HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Ductal adenocarcinoma HISTOLOGIC GRADE: G2 :  Moderately differentiated MICROSCOPIC TUMOR EXTENSION: Tumor invades peripancreatic soft tissues. MARGINS : Margin(s) involved by invasive carcinoma Uncinate process (retroperitoneal) margin (nonperitonealized surface of the uncinate process) Invasive carcinoma involves posterior retroperitoneal surface of pancreas TREATMENT EFrecr (applicable to carcinomas treated with neoadjuvant therapy): Not known LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Present PERINEURAL INVASION: Present PRIMARY TUMOR (pT): pT3: Tumor extends beyond the pancreas but without involvement of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (pN) : pN1: Regional lymph node metastasis DISTANT METASTASIS (pM) : Not applicable Gross Description Received are specimen containers A to D..  All requisitions and specimen containers are. labelled with the patient's name,.  The cassettes and are labelled with the A. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. container is designated " Omentum". It consists of a piece of omental fat, measuring 37.0

Page 3 of 4 x 20.0 x 2.0 cm. No nodules or lymph nodes are revealed. Representative sections are submitted in four cassettes. B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container is designated as " Gallbladder". It consists of an intact cholecystectomy greatest dimensions. are attached. Upon opening, seventeen pieces of black gallstones are retrieved, 0.4 to 1.s cm in greatest dimensions. Otherwise the cystic mucosa appears slightly rough, but no mass lesion identified. The cystic wall measures o.15 cm in maximum thickness. The cystic duct is patent. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes labelled as follows:. B1. cross section of cystic duct and representative sections of cystic body and fundus B2. one trisected cystic duct lymph node B3. one bisected cystic duct lymph node C. Specimen is received in formalin. The container is designated " Portal lymph node". It consists of a piece of fibroadipose tissue, 2.3 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm, with a putative lymph node. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in two cassettes.. D. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container is designated " Whipple specimen". It consists of a partial pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen, including a large portion of duodenum and a portion of gastric pylorus, 22.0 cm in length and 7.5 cm in maximum circumference, and a portion of pancreas attached. duodenal mucosa appears unremarkable, and the ampullary region appears slightly The prominent, otherwise unremarkable. The portion of pancreas, measures 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm. A portion of common bile duct is identified, 5.5 cm in length and 2.2 cm in the maximum circumference at proximal resection margin. The middle portion of the common bile duct appears narrowed, 0.5 cm in diameter. The proximal portion of common bile duct mucosa appears to be denuded..  The tissue surrounding the common bile duct appears fibrotic. likely involved by tumor. The pancreatic resection margin is inked in blue, the vascular bed margin inked in green, and the uncinate through the pancreas reveal a ill-defined, firm mass, 3.3 cm in maximum dimension. On cut changes. Grossly, the tumor appears to be less than 1.0 mm from the pancreatic resection margin. less than 0.1 cm from the vascular bed margin, and o.5 cm from the uncinate  margin. Multiple peripancreatic lymph nodes are retrieved. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes labelled as follows: D1. shaved proximal resection margin of common bile duct D2. proximal margin of duodenal/pylorus D3. distal resection margin of duodenum D4. a cross section through the mid of common bile duct and underlying tumor. D5. peripancreatic lymph node next to D4 D6 to 8. remaining sections of the lymph node in D5 D9/10. additional cross sections through common bile duct and tumor Dil. a cross section through tumor and vascular bed margin D12. tumor with uncinate margin D13. cross section of tumor through resection margin D14/15. a single cross section of tumor with resection margin, vascular margin and uncinate margin D16/17. a single cross section of tumor with uncinate, resection, and vascular bed margins D18. cross section of uncinate margin with underlying fat (including area of suspected fat. necrosis) D19. additional section of vascular bed margin with tumor D20. one bisected peripancreatic lymph node
