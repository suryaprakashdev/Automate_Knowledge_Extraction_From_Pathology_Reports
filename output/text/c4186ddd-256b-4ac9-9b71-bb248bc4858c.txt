SECOND TUMOR MEASURES 1.2 CM IN GREATEST DImENSION, LOCATED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE UPPER/OUTER AND UPPER/INNER QUADRANTS AND CORRELATES WITH THE BIOPSIED 12 O'CLOCK LESION.E D.  BOTH TUMORS ARE MORPHOLOGICALLY SIMILAR. E. EXTENSIVE LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.  MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE; INVASIVE TUMOR APPROACHES MOST CLOSELY TO THE MARGIN POSTERIOR TO THE 12 O'CLOCK LESION (see comment).
