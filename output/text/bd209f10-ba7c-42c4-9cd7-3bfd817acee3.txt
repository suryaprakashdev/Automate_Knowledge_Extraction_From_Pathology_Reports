(Age: Date Received: Sex: F Physician: Location: SURGICAL PATHOLOGY **See Addendum/Procedure** ICD03 SPECIMEN: 'arunona..iyltstiiay Lobula; 852c/3 A:Lymph node, left axilla sentinel, biopsy. B:Breast, left, modified radical mastectomy DIAGNOSIS(ES): 7J6/13/14 A. Lymph node, left axilla sentinel, biopsy:. Metastatic carcinoma, following carcinoma of breast.. B. Breast, left, modified radical mastectomy:. 1. Carcinoma, invasive lobular, poorly differentiated, multifocal, with extensive lymphatic permeation. and extension into nipple. 2. Lobular neoplasia, multifocal.. 3. Fibrocystic disease, proliferative, with atypia.. 4. Metastatic carcinoma in 3 of 12 axillary lymph nodes.. Date Dictated: CLINICAL INFORMATION: None GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in two parts.. Part A is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name and "sentinel node #1". It consists of one piece of well circumscribed gritty tan tissue with attached fat measuring 1.2x1.0x0.6cm. It is bisected and a portion of it is submitted as AFS. The rest is submitted in one cassette labeled A1. Part B is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient's name and "left breast mastectomy tissue" consists of a left radical modified mastectomy specimen measuring 21x17x3 cm. The skin measures 9.5x5x0.1 cm and has a circumareolar scar which measures 4 cm in length. The nipple is mobile and everted. A firm area is palpable. underneath the scar. The deep (fascial) margin is inked black, the remaining margins are inked yellow. The axillary tissue measures 9x5x1.2 cm. Several lymph nodes are palpable within it. One lymph node has been previously. bisected by the surgeon. The lymph nodes range in size from 2.5 to 0.5 cm. They are dissected, proceeding from the axilla towards the breast. The specimen is serially sectioned at closely spaced intervals. Beneath the previously described scar is an ill-defined white, firm area which measures approximately 3.8x3.1x3 cm; it abuts the skin and is 3 cm from the deep margin. A second ill-defined white, firm area is present in the outer, lower quadrant approximately 1 cm from the central lesion; it measures approximately 2.5x2.3x1.8 cm and is located 0.5 cm from the deep margin and 1 cm from the superficial margin. At its center is a 1 cm firm area with a gelatinous appearance. The rest of the specimen is composed of 40% breast tissue, and 60% yellow fatty tissue. Representative sections are submitted in 40.

XI. SURGICAL MARGIN:  No carcinoma is identified on surgical margins. XII. AXILLARY LYMPH NODES: TOTAL: 13 LEVELI: 4 LEVEL II: 2 LEVEL III: 6 SENTINEL NODE: 1 XIII. POSITIVE LYMPH NODES: TOTAL: 4 of 13 LEVEL I: 2 of 4 LEVEL II: 1 of 2 LEVEL III:0 of 6 SENTINEL NODE: 1 of 1 DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT: Extensive replacement EXTRANODAL EXTENSION: Absent XIv. PECTORAL MUSCLE: No pectoral muscle identified ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Invasive carcinoma appears to arise multifocally. A definite second focus is identified in the lower outer quadrant (B26). Below the nipple, the fibrous scar tissue contains multiple separate foci of invasive Iobular carcinoma. Extensive lymphatic permeation is noted.. This report has been reviewed electronically and signed on Interpreted by:  Attending: Case Resident: The diagnosis was rendered by the attending pathologist.. Receptor Expression Analysis Date Ordered: Status: Signed Out INTERPRETATION Test Performed on: Left breast Specimen part: B Slide#: B26 Results: More than 50% of the invasive carcinoma cell nuclei stain with an immunohistochemical stain utilizing an anti-estrogen receptor antibody. Therefore, this tumor is considered strongly positive for estrogen receptor expression.. More than 50% of the invasive carcinoma cell nuclei stain with an immunohistochemical stain utilizing an. anti-progesterone receptor antibody. Therefore, this tumor is considered strongly positive for progesterone receptor expression.. Her-2/neu expression has been evaluated using the. HercepTest. HercepTest score : 0. No Her-2/neu overexpression is identified in the invasive carcinoma cells..  Page 3 of 4
