B: Lymph node, sentinel left breast, removal. - No carcinoma identified in one lymph node (0/1) - Cytokeratin immunostain (AEl/AE3) negative. C: Breast, left lateral margin, stitch new margin, removal - No atypia or carcinoma identified D: Breast, left medial margin, stitch new margin, removal. - No atypia or carcinoma identified. Comment: The anterior margin represented in block A3 has ink within a somewhat fragmented tissue section that is 0.3 cm from tumor. The true margin may be closer to the gross measurement of 0.8 cm. Clinical correlation is advised. Clinical History: with left breast cancer. Gross Description: Received are four formalin-filled containers Container A is additionally labeled "left breast cancer, short stitch/superior, long stitch/lateral." Specimen fixation: formalin. Time in fixative: 8.5 hours. Type of mastectomy: left partial mastectomy. Weight of specimen: 229 grams. Size of specimen: 13.5 cm superior to inferior, 11 cm medial to lateral, 6 cm anterior to posterior Orientation of specimen: Medial-green, lateral-red, anterior-blue, posterior-black Skin ellipse dimensions: 12.1 x 5.2 cm ellipse of dark

brown/gray skin with no lesions identified. Nipple/areola: not present Axillary tail: not present Biopsy site: not present Discrete Mass(es): present Number of discrete masses: one Size of mass (es)/biopsy site: 4.9 x 3.6 x 3.8 cm Location of mass(es): central portion of resected specimen. Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: The mass is located 1.3 cm from the black inked deep margin, 2.9 cm from the medial margin, 2.7 cm from the lateral margin, 1 cm subjacent to. the skin and within 0.8 cm of the blue inked anterior. margin adjacent to the skin. Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: absent Description of remaining breast: composed primarily of yellow. lobulated fat. which is blue dye stained along the superior edge.. There are delicate bands of white/pink fibroconnective tissue. coursing throughout the remainder of the specimen.. Other remarkable features: none. Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor is given to Tissue Procurement. Block Summary: (Inking: anterior-blue, posterior-black, medial-green,. lateral=red) Al - superior tip. A2 - inferior tip.

A3 - tumor and closest approach to blue inked anterior margin A4 - tumor and closest approach to black inked posterior margin A5 - closest approach to green inked medial margin A6 - closest approach to red inked lateral margin A7 - closest approach to skin A8,A9 - central tumor A10-A13 representative sections from breast tissue Container B is additionally labeled "sentinel node, left breast." It holds a 3.4 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm fragment of fat containing a 2.4 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm gray/tan lymph node candidate. The fat is removed and the lymph node candidate is sectioned to reveal a homogeneous gray/tan cut surface. The specimen is entirely submitted in blocks Bl-B3. A small amount of fat remains in formalin. Container c is additionally labeled "left lateral margin, stitch new margin." It holds a 13.2 x 6.5 cm discoid fragment of yellow/red fibrofatty tissue ranging in thickness from 0.6 to 1.7 cm. One surface has a stitch designating "new margin." This surface is marked with blue ink and the opposite surface is marked with red ink for identification purposes. Sectioning reveals yellow lobulated fat with no lesions grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted in blocks C1-c5. The majority of the specimen is retained in formalin. Container D is additionally labeled "left medial margin, stitch new margin." It holds a 10.7 x 5.6 cm discoid fragment of yellow/tan fibrofatty tissue with a uniform thickness of 1.8 cm. There is a stitch present on one surface designating the "new margin." This surface is marked with blue ink and the opposite surface is marked with red ink for identification purposes. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal yellow lobulated fat with no discrete mass or nodule appreciated. Representative sections are submitted in blocks D1-D5.
