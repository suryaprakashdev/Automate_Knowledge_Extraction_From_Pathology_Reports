SP:colon, Right ; resection: Tumor Type: Histologic Grade: Poorly differentiated with signet ring cells Tumor Location: Cecum Tumor Size: Length is 8.5 cm Width is 7.0 cm Maximal thickness is 1.1 cm Tumor Budding: Extensive Increased Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes: Absent Precursor Lesions: Tubulovillous adenoma Deepest Tumor Invasion:. Subserosal adipose tissue and/or mesenteric fat Gross Tumor Perforation: Not identified Lymphovascular Invasion: Identified extensive.

Page 2 of 3 Non-Neoplastic Bowel:. Unremarkable Appendix: Unremarkable Lymph Nodes: Number with metastasis: 11. Total number examined: 40 Tumor deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue: Identified Identified; number:3 Tumor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition) : pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues) Lymph Node Stage (AJcc 7th Edition): N2b (Metastasis in seven more regional lymph nodes) NOTE: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS SHOW THAT THE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE FORS CK2O, CDX2, AND VERY FOCALLY POSITIVE FOR CK7, WHILE NEGATIVE FOR SYNAPTOPHYSIN, CHROMOGRANIN, ER AND PR. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH A PRIMARY COLON CARCINOMA. Some of the immunohistochemistry and Ish tests were developed and their. performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.. They have not been cleared or approved by the Us Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified. under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. 1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.. The terminal ileum measures 11.5 cm in length and 3.3 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin.  The remaining colon measures 46 cm in length with a circumference of 7.5 cm at the distal resected margin.  The attached appendix measures 5 cm in length and averages 0.8 cm in diameter The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally ** Continued on next page **.

 Page 3 of 3 hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 2.0 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to. reveal a partially fungating and partially infiltrating lesion measuring 8.5 cm in length and 7 cm in width. The mass is located in the cecum, 11.5 cm that the tumor invades possibly subserosal fibroadipose tissue. The depth of. invasion is 1.1 cm grossly.. The remaining mucosa shows 3 polyps measuring 0.2 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The attached adipose tissue is. thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.
