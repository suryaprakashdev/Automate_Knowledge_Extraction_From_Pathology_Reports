Each part is labeled with the patient's name. A. Labeled "omental implant" is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and is a 9.0 x 6.0 x 2.5 cm diffusely indurated. nodular portion of yellow. lobulated omental adipose. The adipose has multiple. mucinous tumor massos with two large masses ranging up to 6.0 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm. The section is sampled for frozen section diagnosis. The tissue is sampled to have solid to minutely cystic. mucin-filled masses throughout the specimen. A section is sampled for frozen section diagnosis. An additional section is sampled for tissue banking. Additional representative sections are sampled from across the specimen: A1 frozen section residue. A2-A4 additional sections sampled B. Labeled "left colon" and received fresh for tissue banking is a 23 cm segment of large bowel. The bowel has a distal area of indurated. creeping fat. This region is inked bluo on the serosa. The bowel is opened to have an 8.0 x 7.0 x 3.0 cm mucinous tumor mass. The mass comes to within 4.5 cm of the distal margin. l4 cm from proximal. The tumor diftusely involves and axtends through the bowel wall and extends close to the inked serosa and mesenteric. radial fat margin. There is l.5 cm of adipose between the bowel wall and radial ! fat margin. The tumor extends nearly to this inked margin. Surrounding mucosa is otherwise unremarkable with normal. tan folds. The adipose is sectioned to have multiple nodular lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are focally tumor replaced with a mucinous appearing cut ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

Representative sections are sampled for routine histology as labeled: B1 proximal margin B2 distal margin B3-B7 sections of tumor extending through bowel wall into underlying adipose to the inked serosal and radial fat margin B8-B11 whole lymph nodes from proximal to distal B12 tumor replaced lymph node sampled C. Labeled "mets" and received in formalin is a 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm portion of yellow adipose. The adipose has two mucinous tumor nodules at either pole. The smaller nodule is 1.0 cm and ths larger nodule is 2.3 x 2.3 x 1.7 cm. Representative sections are sampled to. include normal. adjacent omental adipose cassettes C1-c2.
