Sections show a lymph node measuring 2.0 cm in greatest dimension, partially replaced by adipose-tissue. The node is sectioned and entirely submitted labeled (A1, A2). Specimen B, received in formalin labeled left axilla sentinel node #2, consists of adipose tissue, 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.. Sections show a single lymph node candidate measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The node is sectioned and entirely submitted. (B1). Speclmen C, received In formalin labeled left axilla additional axillary tissue, consists of adipose.tissue, 4.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. In aggregate. Sections show a single lymph node candidate, 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. (C1). Microscopic Descriptlon The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis rendered. Diagnosis A) LYMPH NODE, LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL #1, EXCISION: ONE LYMPH NODE INVOLVED BY METASTATIC MAMMARY CARCINOMA (9 MM, NEGATIVE FOR EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION). B) LYMPH NODE, LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL #2, EXCISION: ONE LYMPH NODE INVOLVED BY MICROMETASTATIC MAMMARY CARCINOMA (1 MM, NEGATIVE : FOR EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION).. C) LYMPH NODE; LEFT AXILLARY NONSENTINEL, EXCISION: ONE LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
