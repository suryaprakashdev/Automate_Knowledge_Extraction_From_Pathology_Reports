Page 2 of 3 Not Identified Tumor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition): pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues) Lymph Node Stage (AJcc 7th Edition):. N2a (Metastasis in 4-6 regional lymph nodes). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right hemicolectomy" and consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon. The terminal ileum measures 11.5 cm in length and 3.0 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin.. The remaining colon measures 20.0 cm in length with a circumference of 7.0 cm at the distal resected margin. There is no attached appendix, and serosa displays a 0.7 x 0.5cm white ill-defined fibrotic focus of a possible previous appendectomy site which is submitted.  The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the  specimen measuring up to 4.5 cm. thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a papillary tumor measuring 3.0 Cm in length and 3.4 Cm in width. The tumor is located distal to the cecum, 3.2cm from the ileocecal valve, l4.8 cm from the proximal margin and 15.0 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades to a depth of 1.lcm grossly extending into the muscularis.  The remaining mucosa is otherwise tan yellow and grossly. unremarkable. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative.  sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for Summary of sections: PM - proximal margin shave DM - distal margin shave T - tumor A-I possible previous appendectomy site. RS -representative sections. LN - lymph nodes BLN - bisected lymph nodes ** Continued on next page **.
