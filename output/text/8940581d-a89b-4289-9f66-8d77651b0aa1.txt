TCGA-B0-4703 FINAL DIAGNOSIS LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY A.  RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR) CELL TYPE WITH SARCOMATOID FEATURES WITH LArge "rhabDOiD"-type Cells with Bizarre Atypia (See Comment). B. FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE IS 4/4. C. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA GROWS IN ACINAR, PAPILLARY AND TUBULAR PATTERNS OF GROWTH. D. THE GREATEST DIAMETER OF THE NEOPLASM IS 10.5 CM. E. THE NEOPLASM EXTENDS THROUGH THE RENAL CAPSULE WITH MULTIPLE SATELLiTE NODULES, BUT IS CONFINED WITHIN GEROTA FASCIA. F. NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. G. ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. H. All Surgical. maRGinS ARe frEE Of The NneOplAsm. I. THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY IS UNREMARKABLE. Y. THE ADRENAL GLAND IS NOT SUBMITTED K. NO LYMPH NODES ARE IDENTIFIED L. TNM STAGE: pT3 NX MX. tNm HIstOLOGiC GRADE = G4. COMMENT: This tumor has an unusal morphology with areas closely resembling clear cel! type carcinoma which are admixed with additiona! more high grade spindle cell components including those with tumor nuclei that are markedly enlarged, with macronuclei, irregular nuclear shapes and pleomorphism. In addition, there are areas with glandular formation, remniscent of an "intestinal" type morphology. Taken together, these are unusual histologica! findings.
