E: Right breast wire guided; lumpectomy Gross Description: The specimens are received in five containers each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.. A. The first container is additionally identified as, 'right breast sentinel node #1'. Received fresh and placed in formalin are 2 fragments of ovoid yellow. to brown rubbery tissue. The first measures 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm and the second is 4.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. A number of lymph node candidates are identified the largest of which measures 4.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:. A1: 3 lymph node candidates A2: One lymph node candidate. A3-A4: One lymph node candidate bisected B. The second container is additionally identified as, 'right breast sentinel. node #2'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is an ovoid fragment of. yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.8 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm. A brown-tan lymph node is identified that measures 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. It is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette B1 along with the surrounding fat.. C. The third container is additionally identified as, 'right breast sentinel node #3'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a fragment of rubbery.

yellow-tanto brown tissue measuring 1.3 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. It is entirely. submitted in cassette C1. D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, 'additional anterior. margin'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a rectangular fragment of soft. to rubbery yellow-tan tissue measuring 2.3 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm. A double suture marks. the final anterior margin. This margin is inked blue and the remainder of the specimen is inked black. The specimen is then serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes D1-D2. E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, 'right breast wire guided Iumpectomy'. Received fresh on a radiographic grid is a 45.4 gm lumpectomy specimen measuring 7 cm from medial to lateral, 5.8 cm from superior to inferior and 2.7 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is oriented with'a short suture designating the superior pole and a long suture'designating the lateral pole. Accompanying the specimen is an x-ray demonstrating a metallic clip Iocated in grid coordinate D3. There is a circled mass in grid positions C4, C3, and D3, and D4, centered on the clip. The wire enters the specimen in grid coordinates C3 and terminates in D4 The margins are inked as follows: anterior - black;. posterior - red;. superior - blue;. inferior - green;. medial - yellow;.

Iateral - violet.. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 8 slices. The metallic clip is identified in slice 4. The wire enters the specimen in slice 3 and terminates in slice for. There is a firm, tan, irregular, 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm lesion located in slices 3 through 4. The lesion is located 1.5 cm from the anterior (black) margin, 0.3 cm from the posterior (red) margin, 1.3 cm from the superior (blue) margin, 1.2 cm from the inferior (green) margin, 1.7 cm from the medial margin, and 4 cm from the lateral margin. The remainder of the breast  parenchyma is white-yellow and lobulated with no additional masses or lesions. Block summary: E1: medial margin, slice 1 E2: lateral margin, slice 8 E3: mass, slice 3 with red margin. E4: Surrounding margins from slice 3e E5-E6: mass, slice 4 with red margin, surrounding clip. E7: Surrounding margins from slice 4. E8: Slice 2 next to mass E9: Slice 5 next to mass E10: Section from grossly unremarkable breast parenchyma, slice 6
