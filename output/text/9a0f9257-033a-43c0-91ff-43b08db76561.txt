GROSS DESCRIPTION 1. Labeled "blue node left axilla #1": The specimen consists of multiple possible 1ymph nodes ranging from 0.1 to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. The 1ymph nodes are submitted entirely as follows: 1A - one possible lymph node bisected, 1B - remaining possib1e' 1ymph nodes. Keratin ordered on both blocks.. 2. Labeled "second blue node left axil1a #2": The specimen consists of multiple possible 1ymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.. .The lymph nodes are submitted entirely as follows: 2A - one possible lymph node bisected,' 2B - remaining possible lymph nodes. Keratin ordered on both blocks. Labeled "suspicious node left axilla": The specimen consists of a 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm pink firm possible lymph node. The lymph node is bisected and submitted entirely in 3A. 4. Labeled "segment left breast, long stitch - anterolateral, short stitch - anteromedial": ~The specimen consists of a 6.7 (media1 to lateral) x 4.3. (anterior to posterior) x 2.1 cm portion of tan yellow to gray white fibrofatty breast tissue. The specimen is inked as follows: superior - blue, inferior - green, posterior. black, anterior - red. Sectioning reveals a 4.0 x 2.8 x 2.0 cm gray white focally hemorrhagic i11 'defined mass which extends up to the superior,, posterior and inferior margins. The distance to the remaining margins is greater than 1.0 cm. The remaining cut surface  features a large amount of fibrocystic change. A portion of the mass and norma7 tissue is submitted to xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx for research (IRB# xxxxxxxxxxxxx) . Representative sections are submitted from lateral to medial in 4A-j with en face margins in'4A and 4J. The mass is in 4c-H.. Labeled "additional segment left breast": The specimen consists of a 6.1 x 3.9 x 3.2 cm portion of tan yellow to gray white fibrofatty breast tissue. One aspect of the tissue is hemorrhagic and ragged while the opposing surface is smooth. The specimen is inked as follows: ragged surface - blue, smooth surface - black. Sectioning reveals multip1e gray white gritty focally cystic suspicious areas which exude a yellow grummous material.The suspicious areas appear throughout the tissue and extend up to both margins. The majority of tissue to include closest margins are submitted in 5A-g. 6. Labeled "inferior margin left breast": The specimen consists of a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm portion of tan yellow to gray white fibrofatty breast tissue. Submitted in toto in 6A. 7. Labeled "superior margin left breast": The specimen consists of a 1.2 x 0.6 x Page 2

Labeled "medial margin, left breast": The specimen consists of a 1.2 x 0.8 x. 0.1 cm portion of tan yellow to gray white fibrofatty breast tissue. Submitted in toto in 8A. 9. Labeled "lateral margin, left breast": The specimen consists of a 1.3 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm  portion of tan yellow to gray white fibrofatty breast tissue. Submitted in toto in 9A. 10. Labeled "anterior margin, left breast": The specimen consists of a 1.1 x 0.5 x. 0.1 cm  portion of tan yellow to gray white fibrofatty breast tissue. Submitted in toto 10A. 11. Labeled "deep margin, left breast": The specimen consists of a 1.6 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm portion of tan yellow to gray white fibrofatty breast tissue. Submitted in toto in 11A. Microscopic H&e stained sections are prepared and interpreted. IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY RESULTS Block 1A, at 2 levels: Keratin: Positive. Block 1B, at 2 levels:. Keratin: Positive in one node.
