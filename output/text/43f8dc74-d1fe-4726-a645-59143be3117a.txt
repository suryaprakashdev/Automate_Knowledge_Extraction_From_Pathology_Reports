TD-03 Mxlsnmi Rjunli ciIlNE Date of surgery : $77213 491.3 Left eye enucleation Macroscopy The eyeball measures 25 by 25 by 25 mm with a posterior segment of optic nerve of 8 mm. At the section of the eyeball there is a tumor of 12 by 10 mm. Samples have been made for cryopreservation and genomic profiling and the specimen has been then included entirely. after fixation. Microscopy The tumor seen macroscopically correspond to a choroidal melanoma. The tumor cells are mostly non pigmented and fusiform. They are organized in crisscrossing bundles. There are atypical ovoid nuclei which show few mitotic figures with 1 mitosis by 10 fields at the 400 magnification. The tumor is distant from the emergence of the optic. nerve and distant from the ciliary processes. However it infiltrates the whole thickness of the. sclera with extra sclera extension visible (specimen D and E). There are tumor cells around the extra scleral vessels without visible neoplastic embolus in the lymphatic channels. Conclusion UUID:C0F9EB5A-8CBD-4BDB-A67C-B205AC198A42 A9EH-01A-PR Redacted Choroidal melanoma of the left eye Predominant cell type fusiform Size of the tumor: 12mm Mitotic index is low Whole sclera infiltration with extrasclerale extension The optic nerve on its entire course as well as the meningeal sheaths are free
