SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #4 LEFT AXILLA F. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #5 LEFT AXILLA INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:  Part A, WLE Left breast, needle localization, gross examination: Tumor is 1 cm from posterior/inferior. margin TPB, Sentinel node #1, biopsy: No tumor seen TPC, Sentinel node #2, biopsy: No lymphoid tissue grossly identified, no lymphocytes or tumor seen TPD, Sentinel node #3, biopsy: No tumor seen TPE, Sentinel node #4, biopsy: No tumor seen TPF, Sentinel node #5, biopsy: No tumor seen Diagnoses called at (Part A) and .(Parts B-F) by Dr. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. WLE LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALiZATION Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "wide local excision left breast needle localization" is an oriented, previously inked, 39-g, 25 x 5.2 x 2.7 cm needle localized Jumpectomy specimen accompanied by two radiographs. The single suture designates anterior, double-lateral. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serialy sectioned from medial to lateral into 6 slices revealing a firm tan mass with surgical clip (slice 3), 1.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm, located 1 cm from the nearest posterior/inferior margin. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. The specimen is representatively submitted: A1-A5: Medial margin, perpendicular sections, entirely submitted. A6: Mass, slice 2 with posterior and anterior margins A7-A11: Slice 3 entirely submitted, A7-A8 demonstrating tumor (clip) and nearest posterior/inferior margins A12-A15: Slice 4 entirely submitted, A12 demonstrating mass. A16-A17: Slice 5, posterior/inferior, inferior/anterior, respectively. A18: Representative sections lateral margin B.
