PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: A/1) RIGHT KIDNEY, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY: RENAL CELL CARcINOMA, chromophobe type (9.7 cm), Fuhrman nuclear grade 2(of 4), arising in the upper pole. No lymphovascular invasion. Tumor is limited to kidney. Renal artery, vein, ureteral margins are negative for tumor. Immunohistochemistry performed at. demonstrates that the lesional cells are. negative for S-10o-Al. A Halo?s colloidal iron stain is positive in tumor cells. The findings support the above diagnosis. The non-neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the findings will be reported in an addendum. B/2) SPECIMEN LABELED "REGIONAL RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES": Fibroadipose tissue, negative for tumor. No lymphoid tissue is present (entirety of specimen is submitted). AJcc Classification (6th edition) : T2 NX MX.. CLINICAL DATA: History: None given. Operation: Right radical nephrectomy Clinical Diagnosis: Right renal mass TISSUE SUBMITTED: A/1) Right kidney to tumor bank B/2) Regional retroperitoneal lymph nodes. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Part A, "#1. Right kidney", consists of a radical nephrectomy specimen (460.5 cm x 1.2 cm in diameter), and renal artery (0.8 cm x 0.5 cm in diameter).s Very scant attached perinephric adipose tissue is present.* The specimen is inked black and bivalved. There is a tan, well-circumscribed mass (9.7 x 8.3 x 6.2 cm) arising in the cortex of the upper pole, located 8.5 cm to ureter margin, 1.1 cm to vein margin and 3.2 cm to artery margin and abuts the kidney capsule. On cut sections, there are areas of necrosis and hemorrhage present within the mass. No adrenal gland is identified. A representative section of tumor is submitted for cytogenetics, electron microscopy, and tissue banking. Representative sections of normal appearing kidney is submitted for tissue  bank, EM, and IF. Gross photos are taken and representative sections are submitted for histology. Micro Al: Renal artery vein and ureter margin, en face,.

Pathology Report Micro A6-A8: Representative sections of tumor, 1 frag each, Micro A9: Tumor quick fix, 1 frag, Rss. Micro Al0: Uninvolved renal cortex, 1 frag, Part B, "#2. Regional retroperitoneal lymph node", consists of one fragment of yellow soft tissue (2.9 x 2.4 x 1.0 cm) which is entirely submitted.. Micro B1-B3: Regional retroperitoneal lymph nodes, 1 frag each, By his/her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a microscopic examination ("gross only" exam if so stated) of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es) related thereto. ADDENDUM: ,RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA: RIGHT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY: NORMAL. KIDNEY, WITH MINIMAL CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA, MOST LIKELY AGE-RELATED (SEE NOTE) NOTE : The kidney parenchyma sample examined shows minimal chronic changes, within the expected range for a  There is minimal focal. global glomerulosclerosis (0.3% of glomeruli), minimal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (less than 5% of the parenchyma), and no significant vascular sclerosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (Block A1o) were evaluated using H&E, pAs, Jones silver methenamine, and AFog (trichrome) stains. The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 326 glomeruli present, of which 1 (0.3%) is globally sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli show no significant expansion of the mesangial areas. There are no discernible craters or double contours of the glomerular capillary wall basement membranes.  Rare distal tubules contain pas-positive hyaline casts... Less than 10% of the. cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit no significant sclerosis. Page: 2 of 2
