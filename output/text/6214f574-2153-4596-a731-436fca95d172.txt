RIGHT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY: Renal cell carcinoma. FSB1. DEEP MARGIN: Negative for carcinoma.. Comment: This frozen section diagnosis/result was communicated to and acknowledged by Dr M.D., have performed the intraoperative consultation(s) and issued the above diagnosis. Gross Description A. Specimen A is received fresh labeled *right partial nephrectamy ink is margin." The specimen consists of a partial nephrectomy measuring 3.9 x 2.8 x 2.9 cm weighing 13.1 g. The specimen is. oriented according to the surgeon's designation and is inked as follows: Parenchymal resection margin inked: Blue Renal capsule is inked: Blacke On sectioning the specimen reveals and irregular ill-defined rubbery intraparenchymal solid tumor. which measures 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm.The tumor bulges the renal capsule and extends to within 0.3 cm of the closest parenchynal resection margin. Cut surface of the tumor is pale yellow to tan brown focally hemorrhagic. Representative section of the tumor in relation to the closest parenchymal resection margin is submitted for frozen section as FSA1. Representative sections ot the specimen. are submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory.Additional sections of the specimen are submitted in 8 cassettes as follows A2-A9: Tumor with adjacent and involved renal parenchyma and overlying renal capsule.d 8. Specimen B received fresh labeled *deep margin, ink is margin." The specimen consists of an irregular oriented fragment of renal parenchyma measuring 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is oriented according to the surgeon's designation and the new parenchymal resection margin is re-inked. black. The specimen is serially sectioned and is submitted entirely for frozen section as FSB1. 1/3/14
