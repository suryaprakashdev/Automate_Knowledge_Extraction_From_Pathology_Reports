Tumor #l was located in the cecum and appeared more advanced with numerous metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Tumor #2 was located in the sigmoid colon without regional lymph node metastasis. In completing the synoptic reports below. I judged the metastatic tumor to be associated with the more advanced cecal adenocarcinoma. ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **

RUN DATE: PAGE 3 RUN TIME: Specimen Inquiry RUN USER: Lab Database: SPEC #:- PATIENT: (Continued) comment(s) (Continued) Regional Lymph Nodes: pN0 Number examined: 18 Number involved: 0 Distant Metastasis: not applicable GROSS DESCRIPTION: Specimen A is received in the fresh state labeled "subtotal colectomy with left tube and Ovary". The specimen consists of the following: 15 cm of terminal ileum measuring 2 cm in diameter. Vermiform appendix measuring 5 cm in length by 0.7 cm in diameter. 65 cm of large intestine measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter. Attached omentum measuring 20 x 14 by up to 2 cm in thickness An ovary and fallopian tube attached in the area of the sigmoid colon. Mesentery measuring up to 9 cm in radial dimension at the ileocecal junction and up to 9 cm in radial dimension at the sigmoid colon. Adhesions are noted at the ileocecal junction and between the ovary and sigmoid colon. There are firm tumorous nodules in the mesentery at the ileocecal junction and in the oment um.  The omental tumor nodule measures 2 cm in greatest dimsnsion. There are multiple mesenteric nodules at the ileocecal junction measuring up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The bowel is opened to reveal a circumferential fungating tumor in the cecum approximately 2 cm from the ileocecal valve. This tumor measures 4 5 cm along the length of the bowel The bowel is narrowed in this area. A second circumferential fungating mucosal tumor is identified 5 cm above the distal margin. This second tumor measures 5.5 cm along the length of the bowel and again the bowel appears narrowed in this area. The attached ovary appears enlarged. measuring 5 x 4.5 x 3 cm. It has a smooth tan surface. Its cut surface. reveals soft tan tumorous tissue replacing 9o% of the ovary. The fallopian tube with fimbriated end measures 4.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter.. The initial gross features are reported to Dr in the O.R. at The specimen is allowed to fix overnight prior to sectioning. Representativs sections are submitted as follows: A1 terminal ileum A2 vermiform appendix A3-6 - cecal tumor A7-12- lymph nodes in mesentery regional to cecal tumor. A13 apex of ileocecal mesentery A14 omental tumor nodule A15.16-- left ovary and tube A17-20- distal tumor A21 distal margin A22-25- lymph nodes and mesentery regional to distal tumor. NOTE:  The tumors invade the full thickness of the bowel wall, likely extending through the bowel wall. Specimen B is received in formalin labeled "right tube and ovary". This is an ovary with ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **
