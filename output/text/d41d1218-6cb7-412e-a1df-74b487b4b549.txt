SLN #1 RIGHT AXILLA Received fresh labeled with the patient's patient and designated "sentinel lymph node number one right axilla" is a fragment of lymphoid tissue measuring 1.9 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely submitted, A1. B. RIGHT BREAST Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "right breast" is a previously inked, oriented, 13-g, 4 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm lumpectomy specimen. The short suture designates superior, long-lateral. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior- orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 6 slices revealing a firm tan mass, 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm, located 0.1-cm from the nearest anterior margin. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted: B1-B2: Perpendicular sections medial margin. B3-B4: Slice 2, B4 demonstrates mass B5-B6: Slice 3, B6 demonstrates mass B7-B8: Slice 4, B8 demonstrates mass B9-B10: Slice 5, B10 demonstrating remainder of mass B11-B12: Perpendicular sections lateral margin. C. ADDITIONAL ANTERIOR MARGIN Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "additional anterior margin" are two previously inked (black at final margin) fragments of adipose tissue together weighing 1 g and measuring 2 x 1 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The entire specimen is submitted, C1. DIAGNOSIS: A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION: - ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1). B.

Her? analvsis.was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit 1) using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in- house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

TSS ID Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit Case No Analytical Interpretation of Resuits: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED Clinical Interpretation of results Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FiSH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome 17 centromeric probe and a HFR-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the F ' by Dr :. A majority of tumors cells displayed moderate polysomy 17 with 2 to 4 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 4 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used Source of case: Tissue fixation formalin-fixed tissue Outside Case No:NA Tissue source breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: yes 1.1 This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LS! HER-2/neu signals by the total number of CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic  mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free and overall survival in stage li, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No  treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER- 2/neu  gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test FDA APPROVED REAGENT  PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed. of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
