A short suture marks the superior margin, and a long suture marks the posterior-laterat margin. The superior margin is inked blue, the inferior margin is inked green, and the deep margin is inked black for microscoplc evaluation. The specimen is serially sectioned, from Iateral to medial, into four slices and is entirely submitted in cassette H1. Part I is received fresh and is additionally labeled consists of multiple irregular, unoriented fragments of yellow-tan soft tissue, measuring 4.6 x 4.3 x It 1.5 cm in aggregate.

Surgical Pathology . Working Draft /Pathology Resident 'Pathologist Signed: Fee Codes: Addenda Addendum. Date Ordered: Status: Signed Out Date Complete: By: Date Reported: Addendum Comment An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed by manual. morphometry on block F3. The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >9o% of tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive. The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 2-3+ nuclear staining in >90% of tumor celis. Internal positive control is positive. Resuit of HER2/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression. An immunohistochemical assay was performed by manual morphometry on block # using the CB11. monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a. scale of 0-3. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene amplification. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for FIsh testing. The results of the Fish test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene amplification. HER2/neu.
