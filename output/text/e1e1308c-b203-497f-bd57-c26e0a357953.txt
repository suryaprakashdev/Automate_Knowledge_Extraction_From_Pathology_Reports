DIAGNOSIS: Liver, segments II and III and new margin, excisions: Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma forming a 3.2 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm well-circumscribed but unencapsulated mass. No vascular. invasion seen. Surgical resection margins, after a single. re-excision are negative for tumor. ADDENDUM: The surrounding non-neoplastic liver shows mild, nonspecific portal inflammation with no advanced fibrosis (see comment).. ADDENDUM COMMENT: A minority of portal tracts contain a mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes with rare plasma cells and occasional. neutrophils. The latter appear to be associated with patchy. ductular proliferation. Interlobular bile ducts are intact.. A solitary portal-based granulomatous reaction is seen. The lobular parenchyma demonstrates surgical hepatitis with trace steatosis but no active steatohepatitis. There is no significant fibrosis.
