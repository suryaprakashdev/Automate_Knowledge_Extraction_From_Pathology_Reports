I0D 0 :3 Date of surgery : Melsnem, npu relle eell 8772/3 OChoro Left eye enucleation Cw9.3 D 3/1e/14 Macros copy The eyeball measures 25 mm in diameter with a segment of optic nerve of 6 mm. At the section, there is at the postero-lateral part of the eyeball a large pigmented tumor adherent to the internal face of the sclera, measuring 18 mm main line by 12 mm maximum thickness. Samples have been made for cryopreservation . The specimen has been then included entirely after fixation. Microscopy The tumor seen laterally at the posterior part of the eye correspond microscopically to a tumor proliferation of fusiform cells made of medium to large size cells with cytoplasm nearly always loaded with melanin pigment preventing the visualization of the nucleus which is therefore difficult to analyze. This tumor proliferation is adherent to the internal part of the sclera whose internal layers are infiltrated without any extraocular infiltration. In the front, the tumor infiltrates the posterior part of the ciliary body but stays outside the iris, the irido corneal angle and the anterior chamber. Behind, it stays distant from the intraocular emergence of the optic nerve which is free on its entire course ( prelaminar part, optic foramen, post laminar part , meningeal sheaths and posterior cut end.). Conclusion Melanoma with fusiform cells measuring 18 by12 mm main lines.. The tumor infiltrates in front the posterior part of the ciliary body.Behind, the proliferation stays distant from the intraocular emergence of the optic nerve which is free on its entire course ( prelaminar part, optic foramen, post laminar part , meningeal sheaths and posterior cut end.) The tumor proliferation infiltrates the internal layers of the sclera but no extra sclera extension was found. UUID:9495F79F-3227-454F-942C-05CEC7827385 TCGA-V4-A9EK-01A-PR Redacted fw i3|3af13
