Negative for neoplasm (Dr. .. B. Negative for neoplasm (Dr.. GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Received fresh at the frozen desk labeled "right distal ureter" is a specimen consisting of red-tan soft tissue with a central lumen measuring 1.5 x 0.8x 0.5 cm. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen as FsAl. B. Received fresh at the frozen desk labeled "left distal ureter" is a specimen consisting of one fragment of red-tan soft tissue with a central lumen measuring 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen as Fsbl. C. Received in formalin labeled "bladder and prostate" is a specimen consisting of a bladder and prostate measuring 17 x 10 x 5 cm. The specimen has been previously opened anteriorly. The bladder is inked black and the prostate is inked yellow on the left and blue on the right. The prostate measures 6 cm transversely, 4.5 cm anterior posteriorly, and 5 cm. craniocaudally. The seminal vesicles are unremarkable. The prostate shows no masses or lesions. The bladder reveals a large fungating mass in the left anterior wall measuring 2.3 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm. Inferior to this mass stretching from the anterior to the left wall is an ulcerated area measuring 1.5 x 0.7 cm. The area of ulceration abuts the left ureter orifice. Additionally seen is a focal area of hemorrhage in the posterior wall measuring 0.4 x 0.2 cm. Sectioning reveals the area under the ulcer and fungating mass to contain an infiltrative firm white lesion which extends to 0.5 cm from the inked black soft tissue margin. The remainder of the bladder mucosa is unremarkable. The prostate shows no masses or lesions. Representative sections are submitted as follows: C1 distal right ureter, C2 distal left ureter, C3 urethral margin, C4 left apex, C5 right apex, C6 3 mm left anterior, C7 3 mm right anterior, C8 3 mm left posterior, C9 3 mm right posterior, C10 6 mm left anterior, C11 6 mm right Page 3 of 5

Sectioning reveals seven nodules consistent with lymph nodes. These nodules are submitted in cassettes Dl-D3. E. The specimen is received fresh at the surgical desk labeled *left common iliac lymph nodes" and consists of 3.2 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm segment of fibroadipose tissue. Sectioning reveals four nodules consistent with lymph nodes. These nodules are submitted in cassettes E1-E4.. F. The specimen is received fresh at the surgical desk labeled "left para-aortic lymph nodes" and consists of two nodules surrounded by fibroadipose tissue aggregating to 6.0 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm. Sectioning reveals a solid mass with red-tan parenchyma with areas of granular appearing parenchyma which is more of a yellow tan color. Sections are submitted as follows: F1 smaller nodule, bisected, F2-F3 representative sections of the larger nodule. G. The specimen is received fresh at the surgical desk labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of an 8.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm segment of fibroadipose tissue with multiple nodules contained within. These nodules are submitted as follows: G1-g2 multiple nodules, G3 single nodule sectioned, G4 five nodules, G5 three nodules.. H. The spscimen is received fresh at the surgical desk labeled "presacral lymph nodes" and consists of a 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm segment of fibroadipose tissue with nodules consistent with lymph nodes contained within. The specimen is submitted as follows: H1-H2 fibroadipose tissue with multiple nodules, H3 single nodule, sectioned. I. The specimen is received fresh at the surgical desk labeled "right common iliac lymph node" and consists of a 6.0x 4.0 x 1.0 cm segment of fibroadipose tissue with multiple nodules consistent with lymph nodes contained within.
