Clinical Diagnosis & History: None-given. Specimens Submitted: 1:SP:Kidneyleftradical nephrectomy 2SP:Lymph node,para-aortic,excision DIAGNOSIS: 1. SP:Kidney,left,radical nephrectomy Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma-Papillary type with sarcomatoid component. Fuhrman Nuclear Grade: High nuclear grade Tumor Size: Greatest diameter is 3 cm. The tumor is multinodular, the largest node measures up to 3 cm in greatest diameter. Local Invasion (for renal cortical types): Extends through renal capsule but confined within Gerota's fascia Involves renal sinus fat Renal Vein Invasion: Identified Surgical Margins: Free of tumor Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Unremarkable Adrenal Gland: Not identified Lymph Nodes: Number of metastatic nodes:1 Number of nodes examined:1 Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma: pT3a Tumor invades the adrenal gland or perinephric tissues but not beyond Gerotas fascia Comment: reviewed the case and concurs with the diagnosis Page 1 of3

SP:Lymph node,para-aortic,excision Lymph Nodes Number of nodes examined:1 Number of metastatic nodes:1 The largest metastatic node is 3.0cm Perinodal (extracapsular) extension identified IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL),AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED ANDAPPROVED THIS REPORT. Special Studies: Result Special Stain Comment RECUT RECUT Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh,labeled,Left kidney"It consists of a radical nephrectomy specimen measuring 22.0 x 10.0 x 3.7 cm and weighing 557 grams.Sectioning reveals kidney measuring 13.0 x 7.5x 3.0 cm.No adrenal gland is grossly identified.Segment of unremarkable ureter is noted,measuring 3.0 x 0.6 cm. The ureteral and vascular margins appear grossly negative and are sampled. The renal parenchyma reveals at the superior pole, a well circumscribed, multinodular, tan-gray, rubbery tumor,measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 1.8 cm.Departing from the tumor and descending into the mid-portion of kidney and renal pelvic fat are other multiple smaller nodules, ranging in dimensions from 0.3 to 1.7 cm. Some smaller nodules reveal a tan-yellow soft friable cut surface. Some nodules appear to be included within the renal pelvic fat.The renal pelvic and calyceal system appears negative for lesions. The rest of the renal parenchyma reveals a well-defined cortical medullary junction with preserved architecture. Sectioning through hilar fat reveals no lymph nodes. Representative sections are taken. Section is taken for TPS and electron microscopy Summary of Sections: MARG-margin TM-tumor TMNS-tumor nodules NORM-normal kidney HYL-representative hilar fat TMPELF-tumor and pelvic fat NORMPEL-normalpelvis 2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled,"Para-aortic lymph node"It consists of a pink-tan rubbery lymph node measuring 3.0 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm.Sectioning of the specimen reveals an indurated,tan-gray,cut surface,grossly suspicious for tumor.Representative section taken Summary of Sections LN-lymph node Summary of Sections: Part 1:SP:Kidney, left, radical nephrectomy Block Sect.Site PCS 2 HYL 2 1 MARG 1 Page 2 of3
