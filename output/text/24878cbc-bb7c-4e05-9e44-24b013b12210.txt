path report Microscopic Sections demonstrate a glioma with biphenotypical features including both astrocytic and oligodendroglial components. The oligodendroglial component. demonstrates individual tumor cells with round nuclei and prominent perinuclear halo formation. They are embedded in a fibrillary background containing thin. branching vessels and microcystic change. Numerous microgemistocytes are. interspersed throughout the tumor. The astrocytic component consists of neoplastic glial cells with oval nuclei and prominent fibrillary processes. The tumor cells diffusely infiltrate the adjacent brain parenchyma. Overall, the cytologic atypia is mild to moderate. Neither necrosis nor microvascular proliferation is seen. Only a rare mitotic figure is identified. These histologic features are consistent with an oligoastrocytoma Addendum A MIB-1 labeling index ranges up to 2.4% consistent with a low grade glioma. Diagnosis Oligoastrocytoma, low grade II.
