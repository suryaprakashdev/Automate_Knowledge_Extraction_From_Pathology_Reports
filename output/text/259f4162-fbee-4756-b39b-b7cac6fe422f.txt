Received in formalin is a yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue fragment, weighing 89 grams, measuring 8.5 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm. The. specimen is oriented with a short superior, long lateral and double stitch deep margin. Inked as follows: Supprior in blue,. inferior in green, deep black, anterior yellow, lateral orange and medial red. Cross section through the specimen shows. yellow-tan cut surface. There is an ovoid, markedly firm, tumoral mass, measuring 4.2 x 3.8 x 2.8 cm. The nass is within 2 mm from superior and anterior inferior margin. No other firm masses were grossly identified. Sections submitted. as follows: 1&2 Composite resection of the largest axis of the mass from antero-inferior to superior margin 3-5 Additional section of the mass in relation with the antero-inferior margin 6&7 Section of the mass in relation with the deep resection margin 8 Mediat margin 9 Lateral margin F. Received in formalin are muitiple yellow-tan adipose tissue fragments, measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm in aggregate. No lymph nodes were grossly identified. Sections from the fat tissue in three cassettes. G.  Received in formalin is a yellow-tan adipose tissue fragment (additional superior margin), measuring 6.0 x 3.q x 1.0 cm. Multiple sutures orient the specimen as a true margin. The true margin in green. The opposite margin in black. Cross section through the specimen shows a yellow-tan cut surface. No masses were grossly present. Submitted in toto in eight cassettes. H. Received in formalin are multiple yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue fragments, measuring 10.0 x 7.0 x 3.0 cm in aggregates.. Twenty lymph nodes are present, measuring up to 0.8 x 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Sections as follows: Two lymph nodes in toto 2-8 Three lymph nodes in toto per cassette. I. Received are multiple yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue fragments, measuring 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. Four lymph nodes are identified, measuring up to 0.6 x 0.4 cm.
