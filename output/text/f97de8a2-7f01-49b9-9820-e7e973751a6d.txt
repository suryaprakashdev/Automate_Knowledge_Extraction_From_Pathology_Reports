FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1  received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER ONE" consists of a tan, fibrofatty tissue fragment measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm in size. Sectioning reveals two ovoid, tan nodules suggestive of lymphoid tissue. The largest one is 0.5 cm in size, the smaller is 0.4 cm in size. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette A. B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER TWO" is a roughly ovoid, tan, firm tissue fragment measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in size. Sectioning reveals a well-delineated, homogeneous tan nodule suggestive of a lymch node. The specimen is trisected and entirely submitted in B1. C. LEFT BReasT TissuE received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated "LEFT BReAsT TIssue" is a fibrofatty tissue fragment originally received fresh measuring 6.8 x 6.5 x 2.1 cm, impaled with a needle localization wire. A radiograph accompanies the specimen. The specimen is oriented with sutures (one stitch=medial, two stitches=superior, wire-anterior). The specimen is inked as follows: Red-medial and lateral, blue-superior, green-inferior, yellow-anterior, and black-posterior. Sectioning reveals a 1.5 cm tumor with well-defined margins and abutting the superior margin. The tumor has a tan, gritty cut surface. Approximately 1.0 cm lateral to the tumor is a second firm, well-defined nodule. The remaining tissue is mostly fat with patches of. white, fibrous tissue. Two sections of the tumor and one section of grossly normal fibrous tissue (lateral margin, approximately 3.0 cm from tumor) are submitted for the cbcp protocol (matching paraffin sections-Al-A3 respectively). The remaining specimen is sectioned and submitted from lateral to medial in additional cassettes labeled C4-c15. Slide key: C4: Lateral most margin. C5-c6: Paired sections. c7-c8: Previously described smaller mass. c9-c10: Paired sections. C11: Same area as c2. C12: Same area as C1. C13-c14: Sections of largest tumor mass. c15: Section demonstrating medial most margin. 15cFss Page 2 End of Report FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
