LEFT KIDNEY, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY - RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, PAPILLARY TYPE, FURHMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 2 OF 4 (4.1 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION). SEE COMMENT. - TUMOR IS CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. - NO VASCULAR INVASION PRESENT. - ALL SURGICAL MARGINS, INCLUDING VASCULAR, URETERAL AND PERINEPHRIC SOFT TISSUE, ARE NEGATIVE. - ADRENAL GLAND NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR COMMENT This tumor focally has clear cell changes. By immunohistochemistry, these clear cells are negative for cytokeratin 7, similar to conventional clear cell RCC, while the rest of the papillary RCC is positive for this marker. The significance of finding a small component of clear cell RCC in an Otherwise papillary RCC is unknown..

The specimen consists of a left kidney surrounded by an envelope of fibroadipose tissue measuring in total 21.5 x 8.5 x 7.5 cm, and weighing 1,224.25 grams. The kidney measures 11.5 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm.

inferior pole of the specimen, a 5.0 cm in diameter area of exposed capsule is apparent. Underlying this is a 4.1 x 4.0 x 4.0 mass which extends from the inferior pole of the kidney. On sectioning, the mass has a variegated, yellow-red, soft and focally hemorrhagic cut surface. It appears well-circumscribed and does not appear to extend into the perirenal fat or renal sinus, and is not present at the soft tissue margin of the specimen. The closest soft tissue margin is approximately 2 cm from the tumor. Satellite nodules of tumor are not present in the renal tissue. Dissection of the renal veins does not show intravascular presence of neoplasm. The renal parenchyma is pale, with blurred corticomedullary demarcations. There is one large cyst present in the superior pole and several much smaller cysts scattered throughout the renal parenchyma. The cysts are  lined by a smooth wall and are filled with clear fluid. The largest cyst measures 2.0 cm in largest diameter and the smaller cysts range in size from 0.2 to 0.5 cm in diameter. A partially fragmented adrenal gland is visible on the surface of the specimen measuring 5.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm and weighing 5.6 grams. The adrenal is without nodules but is somewhat hemorrhagic. It does not appear involved by the mass, and the closest portion of mass is approximately 7 cm distant. A 5.0 cm segment of ureter is present and is essentially unremarkable. Lymph nodes are not present. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 frozen section no charge; A2 vascular margins and ureter margin; A3 representative sections of adrenal; A4 & A5 tumor nearest soft tissue margin; A6 tumor nearest renal sinus; A7 tumor nearest renal pelvis; A8 tumor and adjacent kidney; A9 tumor; A10 representative section normal kidney and representative section of kidney with cysts..
