PROCEDURE: Leit segmental mastectomy needle localization, sentinel node biopsy leu axma. COMMENT: Foci of malignant clusters and glands surrounded by retraction type spaces are Identified, and art stained for endotheial markers (D2-40 and CD31) for a more definitive interpretation. The resuits wil! be reported in an addendum. ER, PR and Her-2/Neu were performed on the core biopsy : 3 and are reported as positive for receptors and negative for Her-2/Neu. Pathologic stage: T1c N0 MX. ADDENDA: Addendum Immunostain tor endothellal markers (iymphatlc and vascuiar) highllght the endothelia! celis and conflrms the absence of lymphovascular space involvement by tumor. MICROSCOPIC: Utilizing formalin-fixed (8-96 hour range). paraffin embedded tissue, immunohistology is performed with the foliowing selected antibodies and designated antibody clone(s), directed against the tollowing antigenic target(s), with adequate positive and negative internai and external controls. Antibodies are optimized appropriate for fixation times..
