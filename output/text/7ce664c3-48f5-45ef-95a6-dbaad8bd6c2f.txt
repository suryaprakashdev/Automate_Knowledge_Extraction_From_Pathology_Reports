FINAL DIAGNOSIS: My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.. ER/PR IMMUNOPEROXIDASE IDENTIFICATION OF ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS IS CARRIED OUT ON SLIDE "A4". DISTINCT INTRANUCLEAR STAINING IS IDENTIFIED FOR ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (SOt) AND ALSO TOR PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (404). THEREFORE, BOTH ARE INTERPRETED AS POSITIVE. HER-2/NEU C-arbB2~ (HER-2/NEU) IMWNOSTAINING IS CARRIED OUT ON USING A 1:3OO DILUTION OF DAXO'S POLYCLONAL ANTIBODY A485 (DIRRCTED AGAINST THE INTRACELLULAR DOMAIN OF c- BLOCK "A4" (BREAST CANCER) erbB2) WITHOUT ANTIGEN RETRIEVAL. NO DISTINCT CCMPLETE MEMBRANE STAINING IS IDENTIFIED. THEREFORE, C-erbB2 (HER-2/NEU) IS INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE (SCORE O). FINAL DIAGNOSIS: RIGHT BREAST MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY: 9NOTE - NOTTINGHAM SCORE 8/9 (TUBULES 3, NUCLEAR ATYPIA 3, MITOTIC INDEX 2)  TUMOR EXTENDS TO INVOLVE NIPPLE AND EPIDERMIS OF OVERLYING ULCERATED SKIN INTRADUCTAL CARCINOMA, COMEDO-TYPE, " INVOLVES <5S OF TOTAL TOMOR MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR - MULTIPLE MATTED LYMPH NODES WITH NEARLY CONPLETE ARCHITECTURAL RFFACEMENT BY METASTATIC CARCINOMA (SEE NOTE) NOTE: ER/pR immunoperoxidase assay and Her-2/Neu testing will bo performed on block "At". A prior HER-2/NzU immunost xas performed on a paraffin block received from Shadyside Hospital and was interpretad as negative . Due to possible differences in fixation among institutions, the HER- 2/Neu' study will be repeated on ths present apecimen. The axillary lymph nodes are ertensively matted, indicative of extracapsular extension by tumor. For this reason, an accurate lymph node count cannot be made.
