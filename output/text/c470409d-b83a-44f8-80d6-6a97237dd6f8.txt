Please see surgical report microsatellite instability testing, which reveled positive staining by tumor. for MSH-2, MSH-6, PMS-2, and MLH-1. The specimen was examined twice in order to identify a total of thirteen lymph nodes (0/13). Intraoperative Consultation Intraoperative Gross Consultation Diagnosis Part A: Sigmoid colon, sigmoid colectomy: - Tumor grossly located 2.5 cm from proximal margin - Verbally reported to Staff Pathologist Pathology Resident Pertinent Clinical Information. Pertinent History/Operative Findings: ~ -year-old with history of sigmoid colon cancer. Tattooed sigmoid mass resected with appropriate margins. (greater than 3 cm). Gross Description Specimen Material: A- Sigmoid colectomy - stitch distal, B- Descending colon - new proximal margin- long silk suture, C- Proximal donut from descending colon, D- Distal donut from rectum, E- Spleen The case is received in five parts, each labeled with the patient's name medical record number and given accession number , and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same.

name and accession number. Part A: Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "SIGMOID COLECTOMY GROSS MARGIN, STITCH DISTAL" is a 26.0 cm long section of sigmoid colon with an average diameter of 3-4cm. The specimen is received stapled at both ends, and there is a stitch at the distal end, as oriented by the surgeon. The radial margin is inked black. The serosal surface is smooth. yellow, with abundant attached peri-sigmoidal fat. The mucosa is tan with normal plications. A 7.6 x 3.2 cm tan-brown fungating mass in present within the lumen, located 2.5 cm from the nearest margin (proximal margin). The mass extends grossly to the serosa with a maximal depth of 2.0 cm, and is solid, tan, with a central clear mucinoid area. Multiple bright yellow oval lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 cm are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1: four presumptive lymph nodes A2: representative section of proximal margin, en face A3: representative section of distal margin, en face A4: uninvolved colon A5-A7: tumor to greatest depth of invasion A8-A11: tumor A12: five lymph nodes A13: five lymph nodes A14: five lymph nodes A15: two lymph nodes A16: four lymph nodes A17: two lymph nodes A18: tumor Part B: Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "NEW PROXIMAL MARGIN" is a 1.6 cm long and 1.7 cm diameter piece of tan-pink colon. The long stitch identifies the new proximal margin, as oriented by the surgeon, which is received stapled. The serosa is smooth and pink. The. mucosa is tan, smooth and normally plicated Cassette Summary: B1: margin, en face Part C: Received in formalin labeled "PROXIMAL DONUT FROM DESCENDING COLON" is a 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm tan-pink mucosal donut with attached blue Prolene suture. The mucosal surface is tan and edematous with petechial hemorrhage identified. No discrete masses are found. A representative section is. submitted in C.t Part D: Received in formalin labeled "DISTAL DONUT FROM RECTUM" is a 1 x 1

x 0.8 cm tan-pink, mucosal donut. The mucosal surface is edematous and displays petechial hemorrhage. No discrete masses are identitied. A representative section is submitted in D. Part E: Received in formalin labeled "SPLEEN" is a 78 gram, 9.0 x 6.0 x 2.8 cm tan-pink to pink-purple spleen with little attached hilar fat. The capsular surface displays leathery granularity and is gray-maroon, with a 3.2 x 2.2 cm focus of subcapsular, dark red-brown blood. The cut surface displays homogenous tan-red parenchyma without lesions. The cut surface of the subcapsular lesion shows an organizing subcapsular hematoma. No other discrete lesions are identified. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes: E1: subcapsular hematoma E2: parenchyma Pathology Assistant Microscopic Description A-E: Performed.
