Breast, right, mastectomy: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 5/9], forming a 2.8 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm mass located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast [AJCC, 7th ed., pT2]. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative fibrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes present. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. A seborrheic keratosis is identified in the skin. All surgical resection margins, including deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 2.0 cm, anterior- superior margin).. B. Lymph node, right axillary, sentinel biopsy: One (of 1) axillary sentinel lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma, the largest measuring 2.0 cm. Extranodal extension is present. [AJCC, 7th ed., pN1] C. Breast, left, mastectomy: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III) (tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 6/9], and lobular carcinoma in situ, forming a 4.1 x 3.8 x 2.4 cm mass located in the upper subareolar aspect of the breast [AJCC, 7th ed., pT2]. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative fibrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes present. The tumor involves the nipple. The overlying skin and underlying chest wall are uninvolved. All surgical resection margins, including deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 1.6 cm, anterior-superior margin). D. Lymph node, left axillary, sentinel biopsy: One axillary sentinel lymph node is negative for metastatic carcinoma. Blue dye is identified. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression. E. Lymph node, left axillary #2, sentinel biopsy: One axillary sentinel lymph node is negative for metastatic carcinoma. Blue dye is not identified. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression. [AJCC, 7th ed., pN0(i-)(sn)] F. Lymph nodes, right axillary, dissection: Multiple (14) axillary lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma.
