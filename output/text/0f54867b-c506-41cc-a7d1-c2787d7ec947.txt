Tumor deposits in pericolorectal soft tisaue: Identified Tunor Staging (AJcc 7th Edition):. pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into) pericolorectal tissues) Lymph Node Stage (AJcc 7th Edition):. N1b (Metastasis in 2-3 regional lymph nodes). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. 1). The specimen is zeceived fresh,, labeled "Right colon' and consiats of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending colon. The terminal ileum measures 5.5 cm in length and 4.5 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 17 in length with a circumference ot 5.4 cm at the diatal resected margin. There is no attached appendix identified.  Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen meaauring up to 1.1 cm in thicknegs. The specimen is opened to reveal a friable polypoid mass lesion measuring 6.0 cm in length and 10.0 cm in width. The mass is located in the ascending colon, 10.3 cm from the proximal margin and 5.0 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows the tumor invades the muscularis and abuts the underlying adipose tissue. The depth of invasion is 1.0 cm grossly. There is a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.s cm gelatinous filled cyst cavity identified in the tunor. The remaining mucosa is tan-brown with the noxmal folds. The ileocecal valve is grossly edematous.. The attached adipose tiasue is submitted for lymph node. diasections.
