This section was evaluated with E-cadherin with appropriate controls demonstrating that the infiltrating carcinoma is. strongly positive for a E-cadherin confirming ductal type. Additionally. a couple of the. lymph nodes were evaluated with PanKeratin stain with appropriate controls. A section from the larger mass was evaluated for a breast prognostic panel.

Number of sentinel lymph nodes examined: 0 LYMPH NODES: Total number of lymph nodes oxamined (sentinel and. non-sentinel): 18 Number of lymph nodes with macrometastasis: 5. Number of lymph nodes with micrometastasis: 2. PATHOLOGIC STAGING: Primary tumor: pT2 Regional lymph nodes: pN2a Distance metastasis: Not applicable ANCILLARY STUDIES: See microscopic description (ER+.PR+.Her2-) GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for selection of tissue for tissue banking labeled with the patient's name is a modified radical mastectomy specimen. The axillary contents measure 16 x 11 x 4 cm. palpation of which reveals clinically suspicious lymph nodes. The breast weighs 1.457 g and measures 30 x 18 x 6 cm.. Skeletal muscle fibers are present on the deep margin. A large mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant. The deep margin adjacent to this area is inked blue. The breast is covered by a 30 x 18 cm ellipse of dark brown skin. The nipple and areolar complex is centrally placed. The nipple measures 2.5 cm in diameter and is somewhat firm on palpation.  The breast is serially sectioned revealing a well-circumscribed grayish-white tumor within the upper outer quadrant measuring 3 x 3.5 x. 4 cm. A portion of the tumor is provided to the tissue bank coordinator. The deep margin measures 3 cm.  The tumor lies 1.5 cm from the skin surface. On further evaluation. thore. is an apparent separate tumor in the upper outer quadrant with a core needle biopsy track This tumor is well away from the surgical margins.. and this tumor measures 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm. The remainder of the breast tissue is fatty in nature. No other discrete lesions are. identified. Examination of the axillary contents reveals multiple lymph nodes which range. from 0.5 cm to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension sach. Some of these are grossly involved by tumor. Some are fatty in nature. Cassette Summary: 1 nipple 2 deep margin adjacent to larger tumor. 3-7 sections of larger tumor tissue between larger tumor and smaller tumor. 8 9.10 sections of smaller tumor sections of lateral. central. and medial broast tissue. respectively. 11-13- 14 two highest axillary lymph nodes 15 smaller whole lymph nodes 16-21- one lymph node each sectioned and antirely submitted. 22.23- representative section of two large fatty lymph nodes 24-26- representative section of sach grossly positive lymph node ** CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE **
