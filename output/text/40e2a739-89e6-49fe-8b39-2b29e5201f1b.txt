Department of Pathology UUID:6F774CEE-19EF-4C9F-BC85-CD929664A3FD TCgA-P4-AAVM-01A-PR Redacted Tissue Source Site (TSS) #: Patholgy Accession No: Patient ID: Normal Sample ID: Pathology Report DIAGNOSIS (A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL AND PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE: PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (2.3 X 2.0 X 1.5 CM), TYPE 2, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. Multiple renal adenomas. Renal cortical cysts. Renal parenchyma with multiple foci of calcifications and focal fibrosis. Margins of resection (vascular, ureteral and perinephric adipose tissue) free of tumor. Adrenal cortical adenoma (4.9 x 4.5 x 3.1 cm, 43.8 grams). GROSS DESCRIPTION (A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL AND PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE - A left radical nephrectomy specimen (overall 15.5 x 8.2 x 6.3 cm) including left kidney (10.5 x 6 x 4.1 cm) and adrenal gland (6 x 4.5 x 2.3 cm). The adrenal gland weighs 43.8 grams and appears mostly replaced by a well-circumscribed, golden yellow, septated. hemorrhagic mass (4.9 x 4.5 x 3.1 cm), extending to within 0.1 cm of the soft tissue resection margin, and to within 2.7 cm of the. vascular resection margin. A pinpoint (less than 0.1 cm diameter) golden yellow nodule is present on the surface of the clamped adrenal vessel, and is located 0.3 cm from the vascular margin. Scant unremarkable adrenal tissue is identified, with golden brown cortical tissue and brown medullary tissue. Tumor tissue is submitted for possible electron microscopic studies.. The kidney contains a 2.3 x 2 x 1.5 cm well-circumscribed red brown, hemorrhagic mass at the anterior mid aspect,. abutting the renal sinus and renal pelvicalyceal system. This tumor nodule is at least 0.8 cm away from the soft tissue resection. margin, and widely free of the renal vascular and ureteric margins. There is no involvement of perinephric adipose tissue, rena! sinus adipose tissue, renal vein or Gerota's fascia. Multiple thin-walled cortical cysts containing hemorrhagic, opaque fluid are present within the cortex of the kidney. Additionally, the papillae appear yellow-white and shrunken. No other masses or lesions identified within the adjacent kidney parenchyma. The pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. No lymph nodes are identified in the hilum of the kidney. INK coDE: Black - Gerota's fascia and closest adrenal soft tissue resection margin.
