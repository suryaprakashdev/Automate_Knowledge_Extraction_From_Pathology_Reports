Clinical Diagnosis & History: 13.6 cm left renal mass.Radical nephrectomy specimen. Specimens Submitted: 1:SP:Kidney,adrenal gland and enbloc lymph node dissection, left, radical nephrectomy 2:SPLymph node,para-aortic,excision DIAGNOSIS: SP:Kidney, adrenal gland and enbloc lymph node dissection, left, radical nephrectomy Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma-Chromophobe type Fuhrman Nuclear Grade: N/A Tumor Size: Greatest diameter is 13.0 cm. The tumor is associated with extensive necrosis Local Invasion (for renal cortical types) Extends through renal capsule but confined within Gerota's fascia Involves renal sinus fat Renal Vein Invasion: Not identified Vascular invasion of small to medium sized vessels is present Surgical Margins: Free of tumor Unremarkable ureter Non-Neoplastic Kidney: Unremarkable Adrenal Gland: Not involved The tumor approaches but does not invade the adrenal gland Lymph Nodes: Not identified Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma: pT3a Tumor invades the adrenal gland or perinephric tissues but not beyond Gerota's fascia Page 1 of3

SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT SP:Lymph node,para-aortic, excision 2 Lymph Nodes: Not involved Number of nodes examined:8 IATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL).AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWEDANDAPPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh,labeled Left kidney,adrenal gland and en bloc lymph node dissection".It consists of a radical nephrectomy specimen composed of kidney and perirenal fat measuring 30.0 x 12.0 x 10.0 cm and weighing 2252gm. After bivalving the specimena kidney measuring21.0 x 11.0 x 8.8 cm reveals at the upper pole a 13.0 x 12.0 x 10.0 cm partially necrotic yellow-tan centrally scarred tumor. The tumor appears to be well-encapsulated but pushes into the perirenal fat.Gross no evidence of capsule breakthrough is noted.Tumor appears to also deform and abut the calyceal pelvic system with no breakthrough. Serial sectioning of the tumor reveals a hemorrhagic multiple variegated yellow-tan and red tumor with a central area of scarring. Sectioning through the hilar fat reveals multiple lymph nodes. A 14.3 x0.5 cm attachedureter is identified which probe patent and negative for lesions.The ureteral margin is shaved and submitted together with the vacular margins which appear also grossly negative. Sectioning through the perirenal fat reveals a 3.8 x 2.8 x 1.2 cm adrenal gland which abuts the superior surface of the tumor.The tumor appears not to invade the adrenal gland. Gross photographs are taken and TPSis taken.
