1cD-0-3 Caruinms, ursthebial, Nos 812013 Situ: b1nddwr Nos C67.9 1/28/1 M Diagnosis 1. Carcinoma infiltrates in four of seven lymph nodes, right (4/7). 2. Four tumor-free lymph nodes, left (3/4). 3. Soft tissue with extensive infiltrates of a poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma. 4. Poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with infiltration of all parietal layers, including the perivesical fatty tissue extending as far as the surgical preparation margin, the right seminal vesicle and the right ureter. Multifocal invasion of the lymph and blood vessels. Dysplasia of preserved urothelial sections.. Prostate shows infiltrates of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate on both sides that is confined to the organ, above all in the right peripheral area (Gleason 4+5-9). Gleason 4: 40%; Gleason 5: 30%. The few parts showing Gleason 3 pattern are by definition not included in the final Gleason score. Maximum tumor size 0.9 cm.. Tumor classification of urothelial carcinoma: pT4b, L1, V1, R1, pN2 (4/11). Comment In the previous frozen sections, parts showing carcinoma in situ were still found in the area of the right ureter resection margin. The follow-up resection material was free of tumor and dysplasia. But infiltration of the pelvic wall and involvement of the cystectomy preparation margin gave R1 status.
