NOTTINGHAm GRADE 2 (TUBAL fORMATION: 2, NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM: 2, MITOTIC ACTIVITY: 2; TOtal ScOre 6/9). C. THE iNVASiVE TUMOR MEASURES 1.5 CM IN LARGEST DImENSION. D. LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. E. DUCTaL CARCInOmA iN SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2, CRIBRIFORm TYPE WITH COMeDO NECROSIS. F. THE DCIS CONSTITUTES 20% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH AND AWAY FROM THE iNVASIVE COMPONENT. G. MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA; INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS 0.5 CM FROM THE NEAREST (SUPERIOR) MARGIN. H. FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES, COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE, AND DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HyPERPLASIA. I. PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES. J. INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSIT'/E FOR ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS AND NEGATIVE FOR HER-2/NEU BY FISH K. PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pT1c, pN1a, pMX. Part 2: SEnTinel Lymph nOde #1, LEft AxilLA, biOpsy --  ONE LyMPH NODE, POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (1/3). B.  THe LArgeSt tumOr dEpOSIt iS 2.1 mm. C.
