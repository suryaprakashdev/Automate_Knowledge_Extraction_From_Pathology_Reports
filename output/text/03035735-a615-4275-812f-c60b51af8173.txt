Welar NDS S1703 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Siti dlur Cx5.0 Case Number : yJ y13|4 Diagnosis: A: Gallbladder, cholecystectomy. - Benign gallbladder with no significant pathologic abnormality - No carcinoma identified B: Liver and adherent ascending colon and retroperitoneal soft tissue, segments 5 and 6, partial hepatectomy and en block resection Histologic tumor type/subtype: hepatocellular carcinoma. Histologic grade: Grade 3 (Edmondson and Steiner). Number of tumors: 1 primary lesion with multiple subcentimeter satellite lesions Tumor size: 1l cm Tumor location: Segments 5 and 6. Tumor necrosis: present (involves approximately 20% of microscopically examined tumor). Worst tumor differentiation: grade 3 (Edmondson and Steiner) Vascular invasion: present, macrovascular. Perineural invasion: not identified. Capsular invasion: Present Margins: uninvolved by carcinoma; tumor is 8 mm from the closest. inked retroperitoneal soft tissue margin and 1.7 cm from the hepatic resection margin (colonic and vascular en face margins negative for tumor) Lymph nodes: 1l benign lymph nodes present within pericolonic adipose tissue (0/11) Satellite lesions: present (multiple subcentimeter lesions). Background liver: chronic hepatitis, etiology unknown, grade 1,. stage 2 (see comment).

Other extrahepatic spread: present, tumor focally extends through the capsule/visceral peritoneum to involve fibrous adhesions (no microscopic evidence of tumor involvement within underlying colon and soft tissue) Additional findings: - Eleven benign colonic lymph nodes (0/11) AJCc Pathologic TNM stage: pT4 pNx NoTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information. available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information.. C: Bowel, ileum, resection - Benign small bowel with fibrous serosal adhesions, acute. serositis, and serosal hemorrhage with hemosiderin laden macrophages - No carcinoma identified Comment: Microscopic examination of non-neoplastic liver reveals fibrotic portal tracts with mild bile ductular proliferation and an. associated chronic lymphocytic infiltrate consisting almost entirely of lymphocytes. No prominent plasma cell infiltrate is identified.. No piecemeal necrosis is identified. There is mixed macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis involving less than 5% of the hepatic parenchyma and no features are present to suggest involvement by. steatohepatitis. A trichrome stain highlights areas of periportal fibrosis with no evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. A reticulin stain also highlights periportal fibrosis but shows an otherwise normal hepatic. plate thickness. A DpAs stain shows no evidence of alpha-1- antitrypsin deficiency (no DpAs positive globules identified within hepatocytes). An iron stain shows a mild increase in hepatic. iron (grade 1 of 4). The findings are consistent with chronic hepatitis, grade l, stage 2. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Correlation with clinical history and laboratory studies is recommended to determine the. etiology of the chronic hepatitis. Clinical History: The patient is a -year-old female with a clinical diagnosis of. HCC.

Gross Description: Specimen A is received with one appropriately labeled container additionally labeled "gallbladder".. Previously opened or disrupted: No. Measurements: 4.6 x 3.1 x 0.9 cm External surface: Yellow/green, smooth and glistening Luminal contents: Green viscous fluid Stones present: No Mucosa: Green and velvety Wall thickness: 1 mm Other comments: No Block #: Al - Cystic duct margin and representative section Tissue remains in formalin. Specimen B is received in formalin appropriately labeled "segments 5 and 6". Specimen Type: Segmentectomy and right hemicolectomy Specimen Weight: 745 grams Measurement: 12.5 x 11 x 7 cm segment of liver with attached right hemicolectomy consisting of 3 cm of terminal ileum and 14 cm of cecum and ascending colon. Orientation: Anatomical. The liver resection margin is inked blue. Capsule: There is a 14.5 cm yellow bulging defect with adherent mesenteric fat and colon. Where the tumor is adherent to the mesentery, the surface margin is inked green. The remainder of the capsule is tan/brown and smooth. Beneath the capsular defect there is an 11 x 9 x 6.5 cm white to tan nodular partially circumscribed mass with multiple adjacent budding nodules. Mass: Further sectioning reveals a blood vessel that is plugged with tumor thrombus. Additionally, the mass extends through the capsule to within 1.1 cm of the green inked mesenteric margin. Where the mass is adherent to the bowel, it appears to extend to but not grossly invade the capsule. The tumor is 1.7 cm from the blue inked hepatic resection margin, and widely free of the distal margin. Adjacent liver tissue: Tan/brown and unremarkable. The colonic mucosa is pink/tan with normal folding. The appendix is surgically absent.. Major portal vein/ hepatic vein: Gallbladder: See specimen A.

It holds a 6 cm in length x 2.1 cm in diameter segment of small bowel. There is a 2.5 x 1.8 cm area of hemorrhagic adhesions 0.5 cm from the closest mucosal margin. The serosal surface is pink/tan and smooth. Opening reveals pink/tan mucosa with normal folding. Beneath the hemorrhagic adhesions, the cut surface is yellow fat.
