1c0-0-3 Carcinoma, mfl+natwg duct, Nos 850of3 c 50.9 Sih Codu: brenst, nos 1+/2f10 h Final Diagnosis Breast, left, wide local excision: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade III (of III), [tubules 3/3, nuclei 3/3, mitoses 2/3; Nottingham score 8/9], forming a 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm circumscribed mass with central fibrosis [AJCC pT1c]. Focal (5%) high grade ductal carcinoma in situ with necrosis is present outside the main tumor mass. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows nonproliferative fibrocystic changes. Calcifications are present in malignant ducts. Biopsy site changes are present. All surgical resection margins, after a single separately submitted re-excision of the anterior/inferior margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.7 cm, superior margin). Lymph nodes; left axillary sentinel Nos. 1, 2, and 3; sentinel biopsies: A single (of 3) left axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN No. 1) is positive for isolated tumor cell cluster [AJCC pN0 (i+) (sn)]. This isolated tumor cell cluster measures 0.11 mm and is seen on cytokeratin and H&E staining. Blue dye is identified in all three sentinel lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel lymph node tissues and confirm the H&E impression. Lymph node, left axillary, excision: A single nonsentinel lymph node is negative for metastatic carcinoma. UUID: 01D97550-C616-4001-85A5-5502D35FA38E TCGA-AR-A1AY-01A-PR Redacted
