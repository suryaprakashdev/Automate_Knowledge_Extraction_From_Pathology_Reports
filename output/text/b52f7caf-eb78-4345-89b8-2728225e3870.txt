LEft INguinAl Lymph nOdE, EXciSiON: - DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LIMPHOMA Sections show the presence of a diffuse large cell lymphoma with. centroblastic morphology, admixed with several accompanying small cells. A minimum area with several lymphoid follicles of a reactive aspect is recognized, some of them probably secondary colonized by the neoplasia The tumour population is positive for CD20, CD79a CD10, BCL6, and CD23, and is negative for CD3, CD5, BCL2, CD21 and p53. A Lambda light chain restriction is observed. There are abundant reactive T-cells positive for CD3 and CD5. The Ki-67 proliferation index is 75%.. FISH study has shown that the atypica! population does not show rearrangements of the BCL2 gene, it presents gains of the BCL-6 gen and Iosses of the chromosome 1 (region 1p36). 4211312213
