Clinical History Not provided. Pre/Post-operative Diagnosis Not provided. Gross Anatomic Descrintion (Dictated by : . Reviewed by on Specimen received in one container. Specimen: Designated "right kidney" is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, MRN and "right kidney". A small piece of the mass was submitted for. Specimen consists of a right total nephrectomy weighing 284 g and measuring 12.2 x 6.7 x 6.2 cm. There is a portion of pericapsular fat around the hilum, superior pole and inferior pole measuring 0.5 cm in thickness. Extending from the renal pevis are a ureter (1.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter), renal artery (0.9 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter) and the renal vein cannot be definitely identified. Tumor does not extend into the ureter I artery and is not present at the resection margin. There is a 8.0 x 7.1 x 5.3 cm well circumscribed, solid, yellow/tan mass without necrosis and hemorrhage in the superior pole. It is 0.1 cm from the renal peivis. The mass is confined in the renal capsule and does not invade the perinephric fat. However, there is possible extension of the mass into the calyces. The uninvolved renal parenchyma is tan/brown with a well defined corticomedullary junction, orderly particle striations and medullary raise. The pelvis and calyces appear smooth and gray/white. No adrenal gland is identified. No lymph nodes or stones are identified. Gross photographs are taken. Inking code: Green -- entire specimen.. Section code: A1 -- ureter, renal artery and possible renal vein resection margins, en face; A2 -- mass with nearest perinephric fat margin; A3 -- mass with pelvis and adjacent rena! parenchyma; A4 - additional section of renal pelvis; A5-A7 -- additional sections of tumor; A8 -- additional section of mass with renal pelvis; A9 - uninvoived kidney including renal parenchyma and pelvis. 8/313
