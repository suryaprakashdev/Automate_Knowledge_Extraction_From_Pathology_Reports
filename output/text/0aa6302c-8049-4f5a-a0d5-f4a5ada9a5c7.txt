LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "left partial nephrectomy" is a ruptured. partial nephrectomy specimen with attached perirenal adipose tissue weighing 31 g and measuring 9.5 x 4 x 3.5 cm. A suture designates the surgical resection margin, inked blue (remainder of the specimen. inked black). The specimen is sectioned to show an ill-defined, soft, 4 x 3.8 x 3 cm mass with. heterogeneous, focally hemorrhagic cut surface approaching the surgical resection margin at 0.1 cm.. The mass grossly involves the surrounding adipose tissue. Gross photograph is taken. A portion of the. specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted: A1-A4: Mass, surgical resection margin A5-A6: Mass, disrupted area. A7-A8: Mass, adipose tissue
