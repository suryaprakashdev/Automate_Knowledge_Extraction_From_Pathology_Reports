HIsrory oF pREsENT ILLNESS: : comes to clinic today. . She had a sensory seizure. She had a second sensory seizure. She had two MRI scans that showed a growing lesion in the left frontal area. She is right-handed. GROSS EXAMINATION: "Brain tissue (AF1)", received fresh for frozen section placed in formalin at is a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm aggregate of multiple fragments. of sott tan tissue. Representative is frozen as AFl, frozen remnant in Al. Additional sections are submitted in A2, with a small fragment retained in formalin. B. "Brain tissue", received fresh placed in formalin at Q is a 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm aggregate of multiple fragments of soft tan tissue, submitted in B1 and 2. Smali fragments are retained in formalin. INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: A. "Brain tissue": AFl (representative)-glioma, low grade (Dr.. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Microscopic examination shows brain infiltrated by a glial neoplasm characterized by cells with round nuclei and delicate chromatin. Satellitosis and minigemistocytes are seen. Mitoses are rare. Endothelial proliferation and necrosis are not seen.  The tumor cells are immunopositive for Grap.  HAM56 highlights blood vessels. The Mib-1 index is approximately 15%. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS: The immunoperoxidase tests reported herein were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the Some of them may not be cleared or approved by the U.s. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

M.D. Electronically signed: ADDENDUM 4: Test Performed: TP53 GENE SEQUENCING Interpretation: EXTRACTED DNA,  FROM UNSTAINED SLIDES, (TP53 SEQUENCING FOR LI-FRAUMENI SYNDROME AND SOMATIC MUTATIONS) :S NEGATIVE. TP53 MUTATIONS NOT DETECTED. SEE OBJECTIVE FINDINGS AND COMMENT. Comment: Mutations in Tp53 are rarely found in gliomas with 1p/19q loss of. heterozygosity. TP53 mutations are more often found in astrocytic tumors and correlate with a worse prognosis. Additional information can be found in McLendon et al. Cancer. 2005; 104:1693-9 and references within. Clinicians should correlate these results with clinical and other laboratory findings. The sensitivity of DNA sequencing is 99% for the detection of nucleotide base. changes, small deletions, and insertions in the regions analyzed. However, this assay may not detect an acquired mutation which is present below the 25%. detection limit (i.e., mutant cell population of < 25%). Only the coding regions of the TP53 gene and immediate flanking intronic sequences were examined. Changes in the promoter region, farther into the introns, or in. other non-coding regions of the gene would not be detected. Mutations in genes other than Tp53 would not be identified. Large deletions, duplications, multiple exon insertions, sequence alterations adversely affecting primer binding, and complete deletion of one allele may not be identified using these methods.
