DOB Age Gender:F Ref#: Hosp# Provider Group: Date of Service: Date Received: Case #: Room Bed: Date Reported: FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGYREPORT Diagnosis: A.&B.)PORTION OF KIDNEY,RESECTION: -RENAL CELL CARCINOMA,PAPILLARYVARIANT, TYPEI. -Tumor measures 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. -MARGINS:NEGATIVE. -LYMPH NODES:NONE IDENTIFIED -SEE COMMENTS PATHOLOGIC TUMORSTAGING DESCRIPTORS: Histologic type and grade: Renal cell carcinoma, papillary variant, type l. Primary tumor:pT1a. Regional Iymph nodes:pNX Distant metastasis:pMX. Margin status:RO. Pathologic stage:I. Lymphovascular invasion:Not identified. Perineural invasion:Not identified. COMMENT: Immunohistochemical staining is positive for OSCAR-CK, CK7, racemase, and CD10.It is negative for CK20 and CD117. This supports the given diagnosis. COMMENT:Tumor extends to the parenchymal edge of specimen A. From pathologic examination alone, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether or not the portions of the parenchymal edge of specimen A which are involved by tumor are true margins or only "specimen margins" in which specimen B is the true surgical margin. Specimen B is negative for malignancy. Additionally,a substantial portion of tumor is less than 0.1cm from the parenchymal edge of specimen A; this area appears significantly larger than the aggregate size of all the tissue inspecimen B. The margin. status in this report was given following telephone conversation with who stated that the pertinent specimen for establishing the margin in question (parenchymal margin) is specimen B.

Source of Specimen: A.Left renal mass B.Left renal mass margins Clinical History/Operative Dx: Renal mass Gross Description: A.The specimen is labeled left renal mass and is received without fixative.Itconsists of a nearly spherical cortical portion of renal tissue measuring 3.2 x 3.1 x 2.8 cm and weighing 16grams. There is a separate 5.5 x 3 x 0.7 cm portion of lobulated fatty tissue. The renal cortical tissue is inked at the apparent base of Case# Page3 Printed This report continues...

Patient Case# FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT excision.It is serially sectioned to reveal a soft easily disrupted pale yellow to pale red neoplasm which measures 3 x 3 x2.2 cm.The non-cortical portion of the tumor appears to have a thin delicate capsule which is smooth. The neoplastic tissue centrally and paracentrally focally extends to the inked cortical margin.Representative sections of the neoplasm are obtained for research purposes.Representative sections of the neoplasm,to include the entire inked cortical margin, are submitted incassettes A1-A7 The two furthest edges of the specimen are submitted in cassette A8.Representative sections of the separate fatty tissue are submitted in cassette A9. B.The specimen is labeled left renal mass margin and is received without fixative. Itconsists of three. irregular fragments of tan to hyperemic tissue which vary from an elongatedstrip measuring 0.9 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm to a roughly rectangular 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm fragment to a 0.3 cm smallfragment. The tissue is submitted intact in cassette B1 Microscopic Description: A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis. rendered.
