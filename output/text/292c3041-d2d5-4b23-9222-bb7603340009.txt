Received fresh and labeled *sentinel node #1  left axilla, touch prep" is a yellow-tan, irregular-shaped, soft tissue fragment measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Specimen bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section. 8. Received fresh and labeled *left axilla sentinel node #2 count 31, touch prep" is a yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. Specimen Is bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section and touch prep. C. Received fresh and iabeled *right axilla sentinel node #1 count 79, touch prep" is a yellow-tan, irregular-shaped, soft tissue fragment measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. Specimen bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section and touch prep. D. Recelved fresh and labeled *left breast (1 stitich superior, 2 lateral)' is a left radical modified mastectomy measuring 21.0 x 19.0 x 4.0 cm and weighs 750 grams. The skin is light tan, elllpse, measuring 21.0 x 16.0 cm. Areola is 8.0 cm in maximum diameter and nipple is impressed and very hard measuring 2.5 cm in maximum diameter. The specimen Is oriented with one stitch at superior and two stitches at lateral. The surgical margin Is inked in black. Sectioning reveals a yellow-gray, well defined, tumoral mass measuring 6.0 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm. This tumor is 60% necrotic with focal hemorrhage. No calcification is noted grossly. This tumor Is located beneath of nipple. The remainder of mammary tissue is yellow-white, fibrofatty tissue. No other lesions Is identified grossly. This tumor is located at less than 0.1 cm from superficial (skin nipple), at 1.5 cm from inferior surgical margin, at 2.0 cm from deep surgical margin and the rest of the surgical margins are away more than 4.0 cm from this tumor. The specimen is submitted in fifteen cassettes as follows: 1 Perpendicular section superior margin 2 Perpendicular section inferior margin 3 Perpendicular section medial margin 4 Perpendicular section lateral margin 5 Perpendicular section of nipple in relation with tumor 6 Perpendicular section deep margin 7 Tumor in relation with nipple and skin 8&9 Hemorrhagic and necrotic area 10-13 Tumor 14&15  Mammary tissue E. Received fresh and labeled *right breast (1 stitich superior, 2 lateral)" is a right radlcal modified mastectomy measuring 20.0 x 15.0 x 4.0 cm and weighs 522 grams. The skin is light tan ellipse measuring 16.0 x 14.0 cm. Areola measures 6.5 cm In maximum diameter. The nipple measures 1.5 cm in diameter. The specimen is oriented with one stitch at superior and two stitches at lateral. The resection margin is inked in black. Sectloning reveals gray-tan, fbrocystic area measuring 7.0 x 7.0 x 3.0 cm, located at 1.0 cm from inferior surgical margin, at 2.0 cm from medial margin, at 3.0 cm from lateral margin, at 3.5 cm from superior margin, at 0.5 cm from deep surgical margln and Immediately beneath the nipple. Deep fibrocystic area has multiple cysts up to 1.0 cm in maximum diameter. The cysts are filled by brown-tan chocolate and green tan puruient material. Remainder of mammary tissue is gray-tan, fibrofatty tissue, unremarkable grossly. No other suspicious lesions are Identified grossly. Submitted In fifteen cassettes as follows: 1 2 Perpendicular section superior margin Perpendicular section inferior margin 3 Perpendicular section medial margin 4 Perpendicular section lateral margin Page 4 of 5
