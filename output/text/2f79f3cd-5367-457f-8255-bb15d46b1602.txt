This L review is part ot a project examining comparative genomic hybridisation on 0 adrenal tissue frozen at the time of surgery and involves centrallsed G histopathological review including assignment of a Weiss score to a large number of adrenal tumours. Y Macroscopic: The specimen labelled 'right adrenal gland" consists of a partly incised. adrenal gland, from which a piece of tissue has been removed, weighing 55g and measuring 60mmx40mx30mm. It is largely replaced by a haemorrhagic tumour  measuring 50mmx50rmmx30mm. 6 Blocks Sampled. MICROSCPIC: At least 2 Weiss criteria are present (Diffuse architecture, Eosinophilic cytoplasm). A In addition there is probable venous invasion (present in block 1). There iss. N some necrosis (present in block 5) but this appears to be of infarct like A necrosis rather than coagulative necrosis. There is some nuclear enlargement and hyperchromasia but I do not think this qualified as nuclear atypia by the. T Weiss criteria. There is no signiflcant mitotlc activity. Atypical mitoses. are not present. 0 M I would classify this as an Adrenal Cortical Turnour of uncertain malignant potential. As I am uncertain how to apply the Weiss criteria in this case, ! 1 shall send the slides to :or his expert opinion. c A SUMMARY: Adrenal Gland: Adrenal cortical tumour of uncertain malignant potential. An. L additional report clarifying the number of Weiss criteria is pending. P T-93000 M-81400 A ADDITIONAL REPORT: T Slides were sent to or consultation. Dr reports: H 0 L Ipane 1 nt 2| 0

Requesting Doctor's Information: Deliver Tc .O_A Received A HISTOPATHOLOGY FOR REVIEW T H 0 The sides submitted show an unencapsulated adrenocortical neoplasm with a L diffuse growth pattern. The cells have predominantly eosinophilic cytoplasm.. Broad fibrous bands are present. Nuclear hyperchromasm and pleomorphism is 0 noted (nuclear grade 3 according to Fuhrman's criteria). Vascular invasion is G identified on slide 5. No definite necrosis is identified. Rare mitotic tigures (2/50HPFs) are seen on the submitted six slides. No atypical mitotic tigures Y are seen. No sinusoidal or capsular invasion is seen. Utilising the Weiss criteria (American Journal of Surgical Pathology, Volume 8 (3): 163-169, 1984), this neoplasm (1 for vascular invasion, 1 for nuclear grade 3, 1 for diffuse architecture, and 1 for <=25% clear tumour cells). Therefore, this neoplasm would be classified'as a malignant nsoplasm. Furthermore, the presence broad fibrous band is used as one feature associatedn. with malignant adrenocortical tumour by Hough's criteria (Hough et al, American Journal of Clinical Pathology, 72:390-39g, 1979). A As you mentioned, there is a small focus of adrenocortlcal tissue is the N peri-adrenal fat tissue in block 1. We think this is ectopic normal adrenal A cortical tissue. A small infarct-like area is identified in block 5 as you mentioned, and we agree with your interpretation. We think that it does not T represent coagulative necrosis. 0 The attending pathologist whose signature appears on this report has reviewed M the slides and has edited the gross/or microscopic portion of the report in rendering the final microscopic diagnosis. 1 c DIAGNOSIS: Adrenal mass, right adrenolectomy A - Adrenocortical carcinoma, low grade - Vascular invasion identified L  - No capsular invasion or extracapsular extension identified P A T REPORTING PATHOLOGIST: H (Electronic Signature) 0 L 0 Page 2 of 2 Y Where'Collected indicates Rec:

Reported by: electronic signature) FURTHER REPORT: Slides from this case were reviewed as part of a study utilising comparative hybridization to compare the genotype of benign and malignant adrenal cortical neoplasms. Patient and ethics committee approval etc have been obtained. The study requires centralised pathology review and for all cases to be given a Weiss score. I have reviewed most of the cases, although difficult or borderline cases have been referred to I thought that this case some atypical features including a diffuse architecture and less than 25% clear cells. I was unsure whether this should be given a point for cytology atypia, yascular space invasion or diffuse architecture. I noted that there was no significant mitotic activity..

Dob/Age REPORT Doctor. ests requesred Tests to follow: As it was a borderline case slides were referred to who considers it a low grade  adrenocorticol carcinoma. A copy of his report is included. I shall return the slides as soon as we receive them back. Reported by FURTHER REPORT: The slides submitted show an unencapsulated adrenocortical neoplasm with a diffuse growth pattern. The cells have predominately eosinophilic cytoplasm. Broad fibrous bands are present. Nuclear hyperchromasm and pleomorphism is noted (nuclear grade III according to Fuhrman's criteria). Vascular invasion is identified on slide 5. No definite necrosis is identified. Rare mitotic figures (2/50HPFs) are seen on the submitted six slides. No atypical mitotic figures are seen. No sinusoidal or capsular invasion is seen. Utilising the Weiss criteria (American Journal of Surgical Pathology, Volume 8 (3): 163-169, 1984), this neoplasm would rate a score of 4 (1 for vascular invasion, 1 for nuclear grade 3, 1 for diffuse architecture, and 1 for <-25% clear tumour cells). Therefore, this neoplasm would be classified as a malignant neoplasm. Furthermore, the presence broad fibrous band is used as one feature associated with malignant adrenocortical tumour by Hough's criteria (Hough et al, American Journal of Clinical Pathology. 72:390-399, 1979). Due to the low mitotic rate, this numour is low grade malignant. As you mentioned, there is a small focus of adrenocortical tissue in the peri-adrenal fat tissue in block 1. We think this is ectopic normal adrenal cortical tissue. A small infarct-like area is identified in block 5 as you mentioned and we agree with you interpretation. We think that it does not represent coagulative necrosis. The attending pathologist whose signature appears on this report has reviewed the slides and has edited the gross and/or microscopic portion of the report in rendering the final microscopic diagnosis.
