Left breast tissue. C. Axillary contents CLINICAL NOTES PRE-OP DIAgnosIs: Left breast cancer. CLINICAL HIsToRY: Left breast cancer. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS FsA) Left sentinel node - Two of three lymph. nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma (2/3). GROSS DESCRIPTION A. Submitted fresh for frozen section as "left sentinel node" are two portions of fatty tissue, the larger of the two is 2 cm. in size, the smaller 1.2 cm. in size. The section through the tissue reveals three small nodules which may be lymph nodes varying in size from 6 mm. to a centimeter. All three submitted for frozen section.. B. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "left breast tissue" is a 7.8 x 7.5 x 4.0 cm. yellow. lobular fatty tissue fragment which is partially covered with a 4.0 x 1.2 cm. pink-tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The specimen has a long. suture designating lateral and a short suture designating superior. The specimen is inked as follows: Superior orange, anterior blue, posterior black, inferior green and the specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral to show a yellow lobular fatty cut surface with minimal fibrous tissue. There is also a white tan firm nodule which is centrally located, measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. This comes within 2 cm. of superior-inferior margin and comes within 1.5 cm. of the anterior and posterior margin. This was located equal distance between the medial and lateral margins. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: Block 1 - representative GROSS DESCRIPTION medial margin; block 2 - representative lateral margin; block 3-10 representative sections additional margins and skin. Rs-10. C. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "axillary content" is a 7 x 6 x 1.5 cm. aggregate of. yellow lobular fatty tissue fragments which are palpated to identify possible lymph nodes. Multiple lymph nodes are grossly identified which range from 0.5 cm. to 2.0 cm. in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: block 1 - two

possible lymph nodes; block 2 - three possible lymph nodes; block 3  two possible lymph nodes; block 4 - one possible lymph node bisected. Rs4. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION A. Sections of the left sentinel lymph nodes demonstrate metastatic carcinoma involving 2 of 3 lymph nodes. The. largest metastasis is 1.2 cm and extracapsular extension is present. B. The following template applies to the left breast. Invasive Carcinoma: Present Histologic type: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Histologic grade: Overall grade: 3 Architectural score: Nuclear score: 3 Mitotic score: 3 Greatest dimension: 3.5 cm (pT2) Specimen margins: Negative, nearest 1.3 cm, posteriorly Vessel invasion: Present MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Calcification: Present Ductal carcinoma in situ: Present Histologic pattern: Solid and comedo Nuclear grade: 3 Central necrosis: Present %Dcis of total tumor: Less than 10% Extensive intraductal component (present/absent): Absent Specimen margins: Negative Calcification: Present Description of non-tumorous breast: Proliferative changes. Comments: None Prognostic markers: Previously performed..

C. There is no evidence of metastatic disease present in 9 additional left axillary lymph nodes. 14, 4x3 DIAGNOSIS A. Left axillary sentinel lymph nodes, excision: Metastatic carcinoma present in 2 of 3 lymph nodes (2/3).. Size of largest metastasis 1.2 cm. Extracapsular extension present. B. Left breast, excisional biopsy: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 3, 3.5 cm, margins negative. Ductal carcinoma in situ, grade 2, margins negative.. C. Left axillary contents, resection: No evidence of metastasis in nine lymph nodes (0/9). DIAGNOSIS M.D, (Electronic Signatuse) - End Of Report
