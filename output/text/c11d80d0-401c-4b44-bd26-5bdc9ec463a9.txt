PATIenT HISTOry: Colon cancer. PREOP DIAGNOSIS: Colon cancer. POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: Same. PROCEOURE: Laparoscopic right nemi-colectomy. ADDENDA: Addendum Molecular Anatomic Pathology Testing. Block 2D: A.KRAS codon 12/13 mutation IDENTIFIED (Gly12Val) Note: The quantity and quality of isolated DNA was acceptable for testing. antibody) chemotherapy has recently been reported '. Mutations in the KRAS codon 12/13 gene were found to be associated with resistance to cetuximab therapy, worse prognosis and poor survival in patients with metastatic colorecta! cancer. 1* However, not all tumors reveal such a correlation, therefore the presence of KRAs mutations should be interpreted in the context of the cytologic and histologic findings and the patient's clinicat history.. Addendum Molecular Anatomic Pathology Testing: Block 2D: A. No microsatellite instability detected (Microsatellite stable). Note: The five NC1 recommended dinucteotide and mononucleotide polymorphisms were utilized to assess for microsatellite instability (Msl) by PCR. None of five markers showed evidence of microsatetlite instability.. High-lovel MsI may have prognostic impllcations, and patients with these tumors may be at risk for Mereditary Non.  Polyposis Colorectal Carcinoma syndrome (hnpcC or Lynch Syndrome)(1-6). Genetic testing for germline mutations  associated with that syndrome is indicated in patients with high-levet Msl, after appropriate informed consent and genetic. counseling (1). If clinical suspicion for HNpcc is very high, genetic testing may be appropriate even in cases with microsatellite stable lesions.
