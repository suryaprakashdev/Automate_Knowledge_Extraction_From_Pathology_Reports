The specimen consists of the right breast, measuring 21 x 20 x 5.5 cm and weighing 1067 grams. No axillary tail is attached. No orientation is provided. The breast is covered with an ellipse of tan-white skin, measuring 17 x 7 cm. The nipple is retracted and measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm.  No discrete ulceration, fissure, or exudate is identified. The nipple is surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2' cm away from the nipple is a poorly defined. slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring 0.7 x 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a large mechanica1 defect, measuring 5 x 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen appears to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly circumscribed. tan-white fibrotic area, measuring approximately 4.5 x 3.5. 3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass, measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximately 1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramarmary lymph node, measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. is identified. The lymph node is bisected and no discrete neoplastic involvement is present. The surgical resection margins are unremarkable. Separately received in the same container are five portjons of irregular tan-yellow adipose tissue. measuring 5 x 5 x 1 cm in aggregate. No discrete lesion or lymph node is identified in the separate portions. Representative sections are submitted in thirteen cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - mass with deep margin; cassettes 2 and 3 - additional section$ of mass: cassettes 4 through 6 - random sections from the fibrotic area, away. from the mass; cassettes 7 through 10 - sections from the four quadrants: cassette 11 - lymph node: cassette 12 - nipple and tan-brown area of the skin: cassette 13 - random sections from the separate portions. B/BPc. The specimen consists of one portion of tan-yellow adipose tissue. measuring 5 x 4 x 2 cm. The specimen has been bisected in pathology consultation. The specimen is serially sectioned and four possible lymph nodes.-ranging from Q.5 cm tq 2.5 cm) in greatest dimension. are identifred The two largest lymph nodes appear-to be involved by neoplasm. Representative sections are submitted in three cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - two intact lymph nodes; cassette 2 - one lymph node; cassette 3 - one lymph node. C. The specimen consists of multiple portions of tan-yellow adipose tissue.

On palpation, fifteen possible lymph. nodes, ranging from 0.2_cm_tQ 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, are identified. Three lymph nodes are grossly involved by neoplasm. Representative sectiors are submitted in four cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - six intact lymph nodes: cassette 2 - one bisected lymph node: cassette 3 - .three lymph nodes; casca++? 4 - five intact lymph nodes. - MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:: A, B/bpc, & C. Serial sections in twenty slides are examined. Sections from specimen A show breast within an extensively infiltrating mammary lobular carcinoma. focally with pleomorphic features. Tumor is widely infiltrative: closest approach to deep margin is approximately 9 mm.  Maximum tumor size [is difficult to assess on glass slides alone, but combining the grossly evidert tumor mass with the additional fibrotic areas, all of which are involved by carcinoma of the gross impression of up to 4.5 cm is felt to be accurate a$ a true assessment of the infiltrative tumor. The intramammary'lymph node. sampled in block Al1, as well as seventeen additional lymph nodes submitted as. parts B/sPc & C are all extensively involved by metastatic carcinoma  morphologically identical to the mammary primary. There is also evidence of extranodal spread involving the soft tissue surrounding several of the lymph nodes. T: -= FINAL DIAGNOSIS: = A, B/8PC & C.  RIGHT BREAST!
