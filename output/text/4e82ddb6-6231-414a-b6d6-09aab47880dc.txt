Patient history: Not provided. LMP: Not provided. PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Right breast cancer. POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same. PROCEDURE: Right breast segmental mastectomy, right axillary sentinel node biopsy. MICROSCOPIC: Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.. Antibody/Antigen Result AE1/AE3 (1B) negative Utilizing formalin-fixed (8-96 hour range), paraffin embedded tissue, immunohistology is performed with the following selected antibodies and designated antibody clone(s). directed against the following antigenic target(s), with adequate positive and negative internal and external controls. ANTIBODY CLONE TARGET ANTIGEN AE1/AE3 VENDOR AE1/AE3 carcinomas The tollowing statement applies to all immunohistochemlstry, insltu hybridization (ISH & FisH), molecular anatomic pathology, and immunofluorescence testing: The testing was developed and its performance characterlstics datermined by the ! required by the CtiA '88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved tor the speclfic use by the U.s. Food and Drug Administratlon, but the FDA has determined such approva! Is not necessary tor clinical uso. aa This laboratory is certitied under the Cinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ot 1988 (*CLiA") as qualitied to perform high- complexity clinical testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLiA, AsR's used In this laboratory have been established and verified for accuracy and precision. Additional Intormation about this type of test is available upon request.

COMMENT: One of the lymph nodes is confirmed negative by Immunohistochemical staining (1B). The positive basal-tike.  Immunohlstochemical markers performed on the previous blopsy combined with the presence of matrix production and squamous differentiation in the current specimen support metaplastlc subtype of Infiltrating ductal carcinoma..
