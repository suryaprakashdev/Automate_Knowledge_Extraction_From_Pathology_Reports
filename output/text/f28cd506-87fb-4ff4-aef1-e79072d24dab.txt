COMMENT: For staging and synoptic reporting purposes, the soft tissue deposit in level 2 of the left neck (part 6) is considered a positive lymph node with extensive extracapsular spread, though there is no actual residual lymph node. architecture. Additionally, the vallecular margin is considered positive, albeit involved by a separate primary tumor. Pathologist: ** Report Electronically Signed Out ** By Pathologist: My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fixed in nine parts. Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left hypopharynx". It consists of fragments of white-tan soft tissue measuring 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section consultation and resubmitted in cassette labeled 1AFS. Pat 2 is received fixed labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "right external jugular vein + node". It consists of a 5.0 x 3.0 x 0.6 cm unoriented fibroadipose tissue. A small stitch is tied to a vessel that is next to an enlarged lymph node (1.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm). The stitched end of the vessel is inked blue. The large lymph node is bisected and submitted in cassettes labeled 2A and 2B. The vessel is probe patent and both ends with surrounding tissue are submitted in cassette labeled 2C. Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "right neck levels 2, 3, and 4". It consists of a 10.5 x 3.1 x 1.6 cm unoriented. fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is oriented into part 2, 3, and 4.. Possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in greatest dimension from O.1 to 1.8 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted as follows: 3A one lymph node, 1.8 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm, bisected, level 2 3B one lymph node, bisected level 2 3C possible lymph nodes, level 2 3D two possible lymph nodes, level 3 3E two possible lymph nodes, level 4 3F two possible lymph nodes, level 4. Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left external jugular node". It consists of two fragments of unoriented fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm and 3.6 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm. Two enlarged lymph nodes measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm and 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm are identified. Tissue is submitted as follows: 4A one bisected lymph node 4B one bisected lymph node 4C remainder of the tissue, entirely submitted. Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left hypoglossal nerve". It consists of four fragments of tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen section consultation and resubmitted in cassette labeled 5AFS. Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left neck levels 2, 3, and 4". It consists of a 7.1 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm unoriented. fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is oriented based on the radiographic report and divided into levels 2, 3 and 4. One large possible lymph node measuring 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm is identified on level 2 and serially sectioned which reveals central necrosis. The possible lymph node was banked for

tissue bank. Representative sections of the lymph node are submitted in cassettes 6A and 6B. The remainder of the tissue reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging in greatest dimension from 0.1 to 1.4 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted as follows: 6C four possible lymph nodes, level 3 6D two lymph nodes, level 4 6E four lymph nodes, level 4. Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "total laryngectomy and left thyroid lobectomy". It consists of a total laryngectomy specimen measuring 8.0 x 8.0 x 6.1 cm including 3 trachea rings, hyoid bone, left thyroid lobe (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm) and a possible parathyroid (2.2 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm) that is attached to the left thyroid gland. Grossly, there is a 4.1 x 3.2 x 1.7 cm, white-tan, firm, hypopharyngeal mass predominantly located in the left pyriform sinus space. The mass has supraglottic extension involving the left false vocal fold. Gross sectioning reveals that the tumor does not involve thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, preepiglottic soft tissue and anterior soft tissue. The tumor is approximately 2.5cm from the anterior soft tissue margin. The left thyroid lobe is serially sectioned and reveals a homogeneous, fleshy, red, unremarkable parenchyma. The tumor is banked for tissue bank. Digital images are taken. Ink code: Black anterior soft tissue margin. Blue preepiglottic soft tissue Orange areas under the hyoid bone Representative sections are submitted as follows: 7A base of tongue margin, shave. 7B right lateral pharyngeal margin, shave 7C tracheal ring margin, shave. 7D anterior soft tissue margin, left side, shave 7E representative section of left thyroid 7F possible left parathyroid 7G right true and false vocal folds 7H DR anterior commissure with thyroid cartilage 7I preepiglottic soft tissue, left side, perpendicular 7J 7K representative section of the tumor 7L DR representative section of the tumor 7M DR tumor and left true and false vocal fold and the thyroid cartilage 7N tumor and left true and left vocal fold 7O anterior adipose tissue for possible lymph nodes.. Part 8 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left pharyngeal margin". It consists of a 2.9 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm tan-white tissue. The tissue is entirely submitted for frozen section consultation and resubmitted in cassette labeled 8AFS. Part 9 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "post cricoid margin". It consists of a 1.9 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm white-tan soft tissue. The specimen is totally submitted in cassette labeled 9AFS. F INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1AFS:  LEFT HYPOPHARYNX, BIOPSY (frozen section) A. SUFFICIENT FOR ANCILLARY STUDIES. B. MALIGNANT. C.
