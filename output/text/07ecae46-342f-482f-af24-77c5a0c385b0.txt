Lurcinoma, vnyu,'nyinf cuc ak NU Sit: beast, Nos cso.9 lu :urgicat Patl Surg Path CLINICAL HISTORY: Large primary tumor left breast. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. "Left breast biopsy", received fresh. Fibroadipose tissue 5.4 x 4 cm containing a central infiltrative yellow white stellate tumor 3 cm in diameter. Al- AFl. Representative sections in Block A2-A4. B. "Left breast", fresh. A breast measuring 23 x 15 x 6 cm with an overlying skin ellipse 17 x 9 cm. There is a retracted nipple toward the medial aspect.. A sutured incision 6 cm across is present towards the lateral aspect. Numerous slightly elevated brown warty lesions are present on the skin adjacent to the nipple. Attached axillary tissue is present measuring 13 x 3 x 5 cm and this contains numerous enlarged lymph nodes, the largest of which measures 2.5 cm across. The largest three nodes have been marked with a suture and bisected. Sectioning the breast shows a cavity beneath located in the upper outer quadrant the incision measuring 5 cm in diameter. The deep margin is 0.5 cm from the deep edge of the cavity. None of these tumor tissues is present within wall. The remaining breast tissue is irregular fibrous but shows no suspicious lesions. Block Summary: B1- nipple and adjacent skin lesions. B2- nipple. UUID:D792031E-2CCE-4341-83B3-C7D1D84F8F6B B3- deep margin. TCGA-B6-A0X1-01A-PR Redacted B4, B5- cavity wall. B6- lower outer quadrant.. B7- lower outer quadrant.. B8- upper inner quadrant. B9- upper outer quadrant. B10- one lymph node lower axilla. B11, B12- one lymph node .. B13- fibrous tissue mid axilla. B14, B15- two lymph nodes.. B16- three lymph nodes. B17- four lymph nodes. B18- four lymph nodes upper axilla. B19- four lymph nodes. B20- two lymph nodes. INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: AF1 "Invasive ductal carcinoma". Tissue sent for ER/PR. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: Sections show poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type invading breast tissue. The tumor is composed of highly atypical. pleomorphic epithelial cells forming sheets, cords, and columns with minimal attempt at the gland formation. There is extensive lymphatic channel invasion by tumor, and extensive tumor necrosis is present.. DIAGNOSIS: A. "LEFT BREAST BIOPSY":  INVASIVE_DUCTAL CARCINOMA OF NO SPECIAL TYPE MEASURING 3 CM ACROSS. NSABP NUCLEAR GRADE 3, HISTOLOGIC GRADE 3. EXTENSIVE LYMPHATIC CHANNEL INVASION AND TUMOR NECROSIS IS PRESENT.
