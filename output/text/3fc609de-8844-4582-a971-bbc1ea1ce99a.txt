- RENAL CAPSULAR MARGIN: APPEARS UNINVOLVED - PERINEPHRIC FAT MARGIN: NOT APPLICABLE - PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN NONNEOPLASTIC KIDNEY: - APPROXIMATELY 5% GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS - FOCAL TUBULAR ATROPHY WITH ENDOCRINIZATION - MODERATE ARTERIOLOSCLEROSIS - OTHER TUMORS: - MULTIFOCAL PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA - SEE PARTS B-E, ABOVE - PATHOLOGIC STAGING: - TNM DESCRIPTORS: m (MULTIPLE PRIMARY TUMORS) - PRIMARY TUMOR: pT(m)1b (TUMOR 4-7 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION, LIMITED TO THE KIDNEY) - REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: pNX (NO NODES SUBMITTED OR FOUND) - DISTANT METASTASIS: NOT APPLICABLE Staff Pathologist COMMENT: The tissue submitted in parts C-E was fragmented; adequate assessment of surgical margin and accurate tumor size is not possible Gross Description Specimen Material: A. Renal, R mid lateral tumor:. B. Renal, R lower pole tumor: C. Renal, R mid anterior tumor: D. Renal, R superior lateral tumor E. Renal, R upper medial lesion: Part A: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "RIGHT MID LATERAL RENAL TUMOR", and consists of a 28 gram well-circumscribed, circular mass (4.5 x 4 x 2.5 cm). One side of the renal mass has a rim of normal-appearing, tan-gray renal parenchyma; the other side is an encapsulated firm mass. The specimen is serially sectioned, and the cut surface shows a friable, hemorrhagic, yellow mass that does not appear to extend through the renal capsule. The tumor abuts the inked resection. margin. A portion of this tumor is submitted for further studies (tissue banking). Ink Code:

The cut surface shows a hemorrhagic yellow nodule. The specimen is. serially sectioned and entirely submitted in B1-2. Part C: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "RIGHT ANTERIOR MID LESION RENAL TUMOR", and consists of two tan-gray nodules (1.2 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm in aggregate). The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C1. Part D: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "RIGHT SUPERIOR LATERAL RENAL TUMOR", and consists of two tan-gray fragments of tissue (1.8) x 1.4 x 0.4 cm in aggregate). The specimen is submitted entirely in D1. Part E: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "RIGHT UPPER MEDIAL RENAL LESION", and consists of multiple fragments of tan-gray tissue (0.9 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm in aggregate). The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette E1. Pathology Resident Microscopic Description A-E: Performed.
