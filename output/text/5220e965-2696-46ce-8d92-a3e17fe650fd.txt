SPECIMEN LABELED "KIDNEY FOR TUMOR BANK": RENAL CELL CARcINOMA (20.6 cm), Chromophobe type, Fuhrman nuclear grade II. The, tumor compresses the renal cortex, but does not invade the perirenal adipose tissue. No lymphovascular invasion identified. The renal artery, vein, and ureter margins are negative for tumor. Uninvolved kidney with no significant pathologic change. Adrenal gland; no diagnostic abnormality recognized.. AJcc (6th Edition) Classification: T2 Nx Mx. NoTe: A modified Hale's colloidal iron stain is in progress to confirm the chromophobe features SURGICAL ADDENDUM: SPECIMEN LABELED "KIDNEY The Hale's colloidal iron stain is positive, supporting chromophobe differentiation of RENAL CELL CARCINOMA NOTE: Repeat iron stain (Hale's colloidal iron) and a CK7 impox were performed on selected sections where oncocytoid and chromophobe features overlap. The immunostaining pattern for Ck7 shows diffuse positivity in both areas supporting the diagnosis with chromophobe RENAL CELL CARcINOMA. The diagnosis remains unchanged. CLINICA History CT - large (L) renal mass. Operation: (L) rad, nephrectomy. clinical Diagnosis: (L) renal mass. TISSUE SUBMITTED: #1. (L) kidney. GROSS DESCRIPTION: by SANTAGATA,SANDRO,M.D.,PH.D. The specimen was received fresh, in one part, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, "Kidney for tumor bank", and consists of a 2277.8 g (12.5 x 12.0 x 11.0 cm) nephrectomy specimen with adrenal gland (12.4 x 2.3 x 0.4cm. There is a renal vein (1.5 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter), a renal artery (2.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), and ureter (6.2 cm in length x 1.0 cm in diameter proximaly x 0.4 cm in diameter at the margin). There is a 20.6 x 14.0 x 11.0 cm yellow/golden brown and focally hemorrhagic mass which protrudes from the kidney compressing the cortex into a thin rim in the upper pole. The mass is incapsulated by a thin membrane (less than 0.1 cm in dimension).  The mass is ll.5 cm from the ureter, 7.0 cm from the renal vein and 7.8 cm from the renal artery. Representative sections of the mass and normal tissue are submitted to the tissue bank and cytogenetics. The tumor has a large focus of hemorrhage and fibrosis (5.3 x 3.8 x 2.9 cm) as well as multiple areas of necrosis..
