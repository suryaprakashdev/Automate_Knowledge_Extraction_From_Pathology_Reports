Invasive spreading of the tumor within all intestinal wall layers up to the bordering mesocolic fatty tissue and the level of the subserosa. Oral and aboral resection margins are tumor-free. Three of nineteen lymph nodes display metastasis of the colon carcinoma, not extending across the capsules. Stage of tumor is therefore: pT3, pN1 (3/19) L0 V0; G3 R0
