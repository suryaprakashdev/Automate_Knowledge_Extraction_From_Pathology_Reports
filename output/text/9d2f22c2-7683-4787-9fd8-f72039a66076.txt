METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING 18 OF 20 EXAMINED LYMPH NODES EXTENSIVE EXTRANODAL EXTENSION AND NON-NODAL METASTASES C. LEFT SUPRACLAVICULAR LYMPH NODE, EXCISON:  METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING 1 EXAMINED LYMPH NODE COMMENT : The findings were discussed with by phone The deep surgical margin is involved by residual gross tumor (Block A24). The medial, superior, and inferior margins are involved (< 0.6mm) by microscopic foci, separate from the tumor. (Blocks A5, A10, All, A23, A39). Of the 18 involved axillary lymph nodes, 1 has a micrometastasis (B3). An additional lymph node (b22) has isolated tumor cells. These were identified by routine light microscopy and hematoxylin-eosin stain.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974S SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Patient: Specimen #: CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY: A year old female with left breast cancer with a positive margin. Palpable lymph node. PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer. POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer. GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. LEFT BREAsT LUMPECTOMy Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, and designated "LEFT BREAST TISSUE, SKIN INTERIOR, ONE STITCH MEDIAL, TwO sTITCHES suPERIOR" is a specimen which consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, 6.5 x 6.5 x 5.3cm with an overlying ellipse of skin, 5.0 x 2.Ocm. There is a 3.5cm scar on the skin surface. Posteriorly a small patch of skeletal muscle is noted. The specimen is oriented with sutures (one - medial; two - superior). Inked as follows: blue  superior; green - inferior; yellow - medial, red - lateral, and black - posterior. Sectioning reveals a 3.0cm biopsy cavity with hemorrhagic walls and surrounding fat necrosis in the medial half of the specimen. Medially adjacent to the cavity and involving the deep margin is a firm, tan tumor measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5cm. The remaining tissue is fat and. fibrous tissue. Sections of skin, tumor, and grossly normal fibrous tissue are harvested for the cbcp protocol with matching paraffin sections as follows: A1, skin, lateral tip; A2, tumor, medial portion; A3, tumor, lateral aspect; A4, grossly normal fibrous, mid medial - superior, 2.5cm from the tum; A5-A6, medial margin; A7-A8, adjacent representative section; A9-A12, biopsy cavity; A13-A17, representative biopsy cavity; A18  A19, biopsy cavity; A20-A22, biopsy cavity; A23-A25, biopsy cavity; A26-A28, biopsy cavity; A29-A30, biopsy cavity; A31-A33, adjacent left mid section; A34, representative section; A35, representative section; A36-A39, lateral margin. 39cF B. AxILLARy coNTENTs Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, anddesignated "AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEFT TAG AT HIGHEST AXILLARY NODE" is a specimen which consists of a piece of soft yellow tissue, 14.5 x 6.5 x 3.5cm, containing numerous and large lymph nodes. There are several cyst-like structures found on serial sectioning ranging in size from 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0cm to 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0cm. The cyst are filled with a red viscous fluid. Further sectioning reveals a 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0cm hemorrhagic cyst-like structure that has a tan-red surface and is poorly defined. Its mass trails to the lateral edge biopsy tail. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5cm to 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2cm. Two grossly positive lymh nodes and one grossly benign lymph node Page 2 Continued on Next Page FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974S

C. LEFT SUPRACLAVICULAR LYMPH NODE Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, and designated "LEFT SUPRACLAVICULAR LYMPH NODE" is a specimen which consists of a 1.3 x 0.7cm lymph node containing a 0.8cm tumor. A portion of the lymph node is submitted for the cacp protocol. 1CF Page 3 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - PERSONAL DATA - PRIVACY ACT OF 1974S End of Report
