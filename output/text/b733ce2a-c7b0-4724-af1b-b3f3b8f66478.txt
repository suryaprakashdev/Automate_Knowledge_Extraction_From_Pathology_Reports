SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT Gross Description: A. Received fresh at the frozen desk is a specimen labeled "left distal ureter" consisting of one piece of Iuminal tissue measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is unoriented. The specimen is bisected and totally submitted for frozen section as A1.. B. Received fresh at the frozen desk is a specimen labeled *right distal ureter" consisting of one piece of unoriented luminal tissue measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and totally. submitted for frozen section as B1.. C. Received in formalin labeled "bladder and prostate" is a specimen consisting of a urinary bladder with attached prostate and seminal vesicles. The bladder measures 11 x 10 x 4 cm. The exterior surface of the bladder is covered by fibroadipose tissue and is inked black. After the bladder is opened, a polypoid mass measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm is identified in the left posterior inferior wall of the bladder 0.2 cm from the left ureter. On sectioning, the mass extends through the muscularis into the surrounding adipose tissue but appears to be 0.4 cm from soft tissue margin (inked black). The tumor portion involving the bladder wall has the following dimensions: 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. The remaining bladder mucosa is slightly edematous. A segment of right ureter is 1 cm. It is patent with unremarkable mucosa. A segment of left ureter is 1 cm. Its mucosa is roughened, but it is patent. The prostate measures 3.5 cm transversely, 3 cm anteroposteriorly, and 3 cm craniocaudally. The capsular surface is smooth. The gland is inked blue on the right, and yellow on the left. The gland is sectioned from apex to base transversely at 3 mm intervals perpendicular to the urethra. The cross sections do not reveal a mass lesion. Rubbery nodularity is not present. The seminal vesicles are unremarkable. Sections are submitted as follows: C1 right ureteric margin, C2 left ureteric margin, C3 urethral margin, C4 tumor with deepest extension, C5-C8 tumor involving bladder wall, C9 left ureter, C10 right ureter, C11 posterior bladder wall, C12 right bladder wall, C13 left bladder wall, C14 bladder dome, C15 bladder trigone, C16 right apex of the prostate, C17 left apex of the prostate, C18 right mid portion of the prostate at 9 mm, C19 left mid portion of the prostate at 9 mm, C20 right base of the prostate with right seminal vesicle, C21 left base of the prostate, C22 left seminal vesicle, C23 anterior bladder wall.. D. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic Jymph node" are multiple irregular segments of fibroadipose  tissue aggregating to 6.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm. Palpation reveals 10 tan-pink firm nodules resembling lymph. nodes ranging in size from 0.7 to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The nodules are totally submitted in formalin as follows: D1 two nodules; D2 two nodules; D3 two nodules; D4 two nodules; D5 one nodule; D6-D9 largest nodule, serially sectioned, totally submitted. E. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple irregular segments of fibroadipose tissue aggregating to 6.0 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm. Palpation reveals 17 tan-pink firm nodules resembling lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.2 to 6.0 cm in greatest dimension. The nodules are totally submitted in formalin as follows: E1 four nodules; E2 four nodules; E3 four nodules; E4 two nodules; E5 one nodule bisected, totally submitted; E6 one nodule; E7-E11 largest nodule, sectioned, totally submitted.
