Diagnosis / Diagnoses: 1.: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins, under inclusion of an ulcerated, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (right flexure), with infiltration and penetration of the lamina muscularis propria (G2, pT2).. 2.: Rectal resectate with inclusion of a broad-based tubulovillous adenoma with mild dysplasia (synonym: low-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia) and also with free-free resection margins. A follow-up report will be made on the lymph node status. Follow-up report: A total of 18 lymph nodes of up to 0.9 cm in size in the vicinity of the tumor were dissected out of the pericolic fatty tissue in the region of the right flexure (1.) after acetone fixation. Based on microscopy, these were all tumor-free.. In conclusion, or in summary, a stage of pT2 pN0 (0/18) is thus determined for the adenocarcinoma described in the right hemicolectomy specimen.. There were also no histological abnormalities in the fatty tissue on the rectal resectate.
