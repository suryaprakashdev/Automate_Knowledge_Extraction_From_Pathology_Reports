Date of surgery : O.h OCowid c49 3 Left eye enucleation 3/c/14 Macroscopy The eyeball measures 25 mm and the optic nerve 5 mm. Samples have been made for cryo preservation .The specimen has been then included entirely Microscopy The eyeball is occupied by a tumor proliferation which morphologic features are those of a fusiform cell melanoma.. The lesion is loaded with melanin pigment. The mitotic index is low with 1mitosis out of 10 high 400 magnification fields. The lesion infiltrates the internal third of the sclera. There is no extra scleral extension. The tumor proliferation is distant from the internal emergence of the optic nerve. The optic foramen, the pre and post laminar section, the cut end and the meningeal sheaths are free of tumor. The iris, the ciliary body and the anterior chamber are free of tumor. Conclusion Choroidal melanoma with fusiform cells Size of the lesion: 15 mm Low mitotic activity Optic nerve (optic foramen, per and post laminar sections), meningeal sheaths and cut end of optic nerve free of tumor The iris, the ciliary body and the anterior chamber are free of tumor.
