Lymph Nodes: Not involved Number of nodes examined:4  The immunostain for AE1/AE3 supports the diagnosis 6. SP: Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision.

The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Left distal ureter, freeze end opposite clip" and consists of a portion of ureter measuring 1.2 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The opposite area to the clip is representatively submitted for frozen section. The remaining tissue is trisected and entirely submitted. Summary of sections: FSC -- frozen section control C-E-clipped end RT-remaining tissue Page 3 of 6

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Right distal ureter, freeze end opposite clip" and consists of a portion of ureter measuring 1.3 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The  area opposite to the clip is representatively submitted for frozen section. The remaining tissue is trisected and entirely submitted. Summary of sections: FSC -- frozen section control C-E-clipped end RT- remaining 3). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Distal urethra margin" and consists of a single pink-tan soft tissue measuring 0.3 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: FSC -- frozen section control 4). The specimen is received fresh, labeled " Bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles". It consists of a radical cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring 18.5 cm from superior to inferior, 12.1 cm laterally and 3.9 cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder measures 8.5 x 8.0 x 3.5 cm, the prostate measures 4.0 x 4.5 x 3.2 cm, the right seminal vesicle measures 3.0 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm, the right vas deferens measures 6.5 x 0.5 x 0.7 cm, the left seminal vesicle measures 3.3 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm and the left vas deferens measures 6.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The anterior and posterior aspect of the bladder is inked black.. The prostatic urethral margin is  shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal a fungating friable red-brown tumor measuring 6.5 x 6.0 x 3.8 cm which is situated within the right lateral and posterior bladder wall. The lesion measures 1.7 cm from the left. orifice and grossly surrounds the right orifice..  Both ureters are probe patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The. lesion is sectioned to reveal the tumor that grossly extends into but not through the muscularis propria. Extension to the inked fat is grossly not identified. The remaining bladder mucosa is hemorrhagic and focally ulcerated. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identified. The right prostate is inked green and the left prostate is inked blue. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal tan-yellow whorled cut surface and no discrete masses or lesions.  Representative sections are submitted including three sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. The specimen is photographed. TPS is submitted. Summary of sections: UM -- urethral margin RUM-- right ureter margin. LUM -- left ureter margin. L-- lesion. RUO -- right ureter orifice. LUO-- left ureter orifice. LP --  left posterior wall. LA -- left anterior wall. RP -- right posterior wall. RA--  right anterior wall. TRI -- trigone. DOM-- dome. perivesical fat.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT 5).The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.7 to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. All identified lymph nodes are submitted. Summary of sections: LN -- lymph nodes- BLN-- bisected lymph nodes (single lymph node bisected and submitted in two cassettes) 6). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of seven pink tan lymph nodes, ranging in. size from 0.5 to 2.9 cm in greatest dimension. Separately received in the container, is a smooth pink-tan tubular segment of tissue measuring 3.5 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. On sectioning, a possible pinpoint lumen and no additional discrete. abnormalities are grossly noted. All the lymph nodes and representative sections of the tubular segment of tissue are submitted. Summary of sections: E - ends of tubular segment C -- center of tubular segment SLN - trisected node BLN - bisected node LN-lymph nodes submitted whole Summary of Sections: Part 1:  SP: Ureter, left distal, excision (fs).
