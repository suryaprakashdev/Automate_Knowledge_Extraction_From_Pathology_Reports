Specimen A: This addendum is issued to clarify the status of the circumferential margin on the previously issued checklist. The adenocarcinoma is within 0.05 cm of the apparent serosal surface, not the circumferential margin. The remaining diagnosis remains unchanged.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT NAME: SURG PATH #: MR #: ALT ID #: Histologic Type: Mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell type. Histologic Grade: Moderately to poorly Pre-existing Polyp: Not identified Surgical Margins: Negative for carcinoma Proximal Margin: 4.5 cm from carcinoma Distal Margin: 5.5 cm from carcinoma Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: Less than 0.05cm  Specify margin: Circumferential (Radial) margin. Depth of Invasion: Subserosal tissue Perforation: No. Obstruction: Yes Vascular Invasion: Not identified Perineural Invasion: Not identified Tumor Border Configuration: Pushing Additional Pathologic Findings: Hyperplastic polyp. Lymph Nodes: Number Examined: 13 Number Involved: 0 Prognostic Markers: See for addendum : No (Sample was sent for analysis by  instead) Gross Picture Taken: No Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT3N0Mx Primary Tumor (pT) pT3: ' Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the subserosa or the nonperitonealized pericolic or perirectal soft tissues Regional Lymph Nodes (pN) pNO: No regional lymph node metastasis. Distant Metastasis (pM) pMX: Cannot be assessed The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, as it reflects only current pathologic data and does not  incorporate full knowledge of the patient's clinical status and/or prior pathology.. Immunostains for the following cytokeratins (pan-cytokeratin, CAM 5.2 and OSCAR) performed on selected lymph node sections are negative consistent with the above diagnosis.. Attestation: By this signature, I attest that I have personally formulated the final interpretation expressed in this report and that the above diagnosis is based  upon my examination of the slides and/or other material indicated in this report. ***Electronically Signed Out By**** Interpreted by: Gross Description: A. Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "tumor's is a 14.0 cm colectomy specimen with a diameter of 4.5 cm and two stapled margins. The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric site to reveal a large friable fungating mass measuring 7.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm, filling the cecum.. The mass is 5.5 cm from the distal rection margin and 4.5 cm from the proximal resection margin..  The mass appears to be circumferential and due to the size of the mass, distorts. the specimen. There is an attached appendix, 10.0 cm in length with an average diameter of 0.7 cm.. The appendix is serially. sectioned revealing a 0.2 cm lumen filled with brown soft fecal material..  The appendix does not appear to be involved by the mass.  The appendiceal orifice is inked green. The distal margin is marked by a suture and is inked blue.. The pericolonic fat deep to the mass is inked black. The mass is sectioned to reveal an average thickness of 0.9 cm. The mass appears to extend. through the submucosal and into the wall. The mass focally replaces the wall and extends into the pericolonic fat.. The remainder of the mucosa is tan-pink with mucosal folds arranged in the usual manner, however, there is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm tan-pink polyp that. is 1.0 cm from the blue inked distal resection margin. Sectioning of the pericolonic fat reveals 13 possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. The remainder of the pericolonic fat is unremarkable.

A21 - One lymph node in its entirety. A22-A31 Additional sections from the tumor mass Intraoperative Consultation: A1FS, "tumor": Adenocarcinoma with abundant mucin and necrosis. Sections sent for testing. The proximal and distal margins are grossly free of cancer. If immunohistochemical stains and/or in situ hybridization are cited in this report, the performance characteristics were determined by the  in compliance with CLiA'88 regulations. Some of these tests rely on the use of "analyte specific reagents" and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the FDA. Known positive and negative control tissues demonstrate appropriate staining. This testing was developed by the It has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. H18|14 MR #: Page 3 of 3 Date of Printing: SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
