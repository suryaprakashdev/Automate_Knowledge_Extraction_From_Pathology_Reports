(HERCEPTEST) NEGATIVE, STAINING INTENSITY OF O. CONTROLS ARE SATISFACTORY. nOtE:  THE RESULTS OF OTHER IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STAINS SUPPORT THE ABOVRS DIAGNOSIS.  SPECIFICALLY, THE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR CYTOKERATIN 7, BRST-2, AND B-CADHERIN. WHERBAS THE TUMOR CELLS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CK20, SMA, HHF35, SYNAPTOPHYSIN AND CHROMOGRANIN. LYMPH NODES, LEVEL II, LEFT AXILLA, DISSECTION: FIVE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (O/5). I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. *** Report Blectronically Signed Out ** Special Studies: Result Special Stain AE1:AE3 ment IMM RECUT NEG CONT ER-C PR-C CMA (HHF35) SMA HER2-C CK7 CK20 BR2(gCDFp) CHR SYN SYN E-CADHERIN IMM RECUT NEG CONT NEG-HER2 Gross Description: M.D. 1). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "Sentinel node number one, level I, right axilla" and consists of two pink. tan fatty lymph nodes measuring 1 x 1 x 0.7 and 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The largest lymph node is bisected, and the small lymph node is inked in blue.. Entirely submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: FSC -- frozen section control.

2). The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Right breast and level I and. low level II axillary contents" and consists of a breast with attached axillary tail. The breast measures 28.5 x 26 x 4.0 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 2.5 x 1.1 cm. Situated centrally on the skin surface is an everted nipple measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm and areola measuring 4 x 4. cm. The skin is grossly fixed and involved by a mass lesion measuring 5.0 x. 4.5 x 3.7cm situated in the upper and lower outer quadrants between 8 o' clock to 10 o' clock . A suture demarcates the axillary tail which measures 8 x 7 x 1 cm. No tags are present. inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal the mass is The posterior surface of the breast is abutting the posterior margin. The remaining breast tissue shows fibrofatty cut surface. The axillary tissue is dissected to reveal multiple lymph nodes, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 1.5 cm. Representative sections are Submitted, including all identified lymph nodes. has an irregular skin ellipse and subcutaneous tissue measuring 9.5 x 8.5 x Additionally the container 1.5 cm with overlying skin measuring 8.5 x 6 cm which is grossly unremarkable.

THIS ADDENDUM SERVES TO CLARIFY THAT, ON REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS, THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA APPROACHES THE EPIDERMIS OF THE BREAST SKIN, BUT DOES NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVE THE EPIDERMIS. Intraoperative Consultation: The diagnoses given in this section pertain only to the tissue sample examined at the time of the intraoperative consultation. 1) FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: PERMANENT DIAGNOSIS: NEGATIVE LYMPH NODE.
