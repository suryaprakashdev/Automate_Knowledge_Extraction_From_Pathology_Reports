Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen, labeled "Left kidney, adrenal and hilar lymph nodes". It consists of a grossly recongnizable kidney whose appearance is markedly altered by a large mass localized to the lower pole. Attached to the upper pole of the kidney is a portion of fatty tissue investing a grossly recognizable adrenal gland. An attached segment of ureter is identified at the hilum. The overall measurements of the specimen are 22.0 x 14.0 x 8.5 cm. The specimen weighs altogether 905gm.  The specimen is bivalved to demonstrate a large corasely lobulated well-circumscribed and possibly encapsulated tumor with fleshy, homogenously pink-tan cut surface with multiple scattered small cystic areas. The tumor measures 15.5 x 13.0 x 8.5 cm. The tumor replaces the entire lower pole of the kidney.  It appears to be pushing on the renal sinus fat but does not seem to. invade it or extend into the collecting system. No macroscopic vascular invasion is noted. The tumor appears to grossly extend. into the perirenal fat but not through the gerota's fascia. The remainder of the kidney is grossly unremarkable. The adrenal gland is dissected off the kidney.  It measures 5.3 x 2.6 x 0.9 cm, weighs 7 gm and is grossly unremarkable both from outside and on the cross-section. The hilar fat is searched for lymph nodes. Several possible lymph nodes are dissected.  Samples of tumor and normal kidney tissue are submitted for. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted for frozen section diagnosis and paraffin blocks.
