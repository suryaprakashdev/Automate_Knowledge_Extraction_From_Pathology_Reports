Mlcroscopic Description (1) - (3) Sectlons show nodules of metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma arranged in shests and Islands. (4) Sections of the adrenal gland show adrenal cortical carcinona (see photograph 5) replacing the adrenal gland, with multiple nodules of matastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma close to the hllum of the kidney where the tumour abuts the resection margin. The tumour shows positive staining for Inhibin A and Melan A, with negative $taining for Cytokeratin, EMA and chromogranin. Proninent lymphatic invasion is present. The kidnoy shaws no evidence ot malignancy. Page 3 of 4 Referred by.. This documont is sud in accerdance wil
