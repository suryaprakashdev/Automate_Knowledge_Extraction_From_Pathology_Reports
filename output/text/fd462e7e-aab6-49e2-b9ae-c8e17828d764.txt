MACROSCOPIC: 500ml of translucent yellow/orange fluid received. Two alcohol fixed smears and two air dried smears prepared.. MICROSCOPIC: The smears are highly cellular and contain numerous balls and crowded clusters of cells in a background of histiocytes, mesothelial cells and lymphocytes. The cells within the balls have small oval nuclei. Some cell in cell clustering is present..  Occasional cells have vacuolated cytoplasm.. In some of the papillary clusters there is a central core of fibrous tissue. The cell block is also cellular and contains numerous clusters of cells, some of which have a central fibrous core.  Immunoperoxidase staining for Cytokeratin and EMA are positive and for CEA is negative. The cells contain glycogen and mucin is not seen.. Report Data Request : Service Date : Sex: Male Service Time : DOB: CONCLUSION: The cytologic features are those of a malignant effusion and are consistent. with malignant mesothelioma. A portion of the specimen has been reserved in glutaraldehyde and will be sent for electron microscopic confirmation of the diagnosis. Pw TSS, 1ou'?o spihelioid.

From: To: Anatomical Pathology ELECTRON MICROSCOPY LAB. NO. : Patient ADDRESS SEX : M WARD D.O.8. Request DaTe : DOCTOR CONSULTANT SPECIMEN: Pleural fluid ELECTRON MICROSCOPY: As noted in the cytological preparations, there are clusters of mesothelial cells, sometimes. associated with a central collagenous core, forming small papillary structures. The cells have. moderately irregular nuclei and some possess prominent nucleoli. The free surfaces of the cells show well-formed, long and thin microvilli devoid of glycocalyx and lacking any filamentous. core rootlets. These microvillous are slender, wavy and often branched. Apically the cells are. joined by well formed junctional complexes. In the cytoplasm, there are perinuclear. intermediate filaments arranged as tonofilaments and some of these insert into well formed desmosomes. There are small collections of rosetted glycogen in the cytoplasm. Other. organelles are non-specifically distributed. There are no mucin granules evident.. CONCLUSION: Pleural fluid -- The ultrastructural characteristics are in keeping with a malignant mesothelioma. PATHOLOGIST:
